On 10 December 1982, the General Assembly adopted resolution 37/90 in which it endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
In that resolution, the Assembly decided, inter alia, that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should disseminate, through panel meetings and seminars, information on new and advanced technology and applications, with emphasis on their relevance and implications for developing countries.
The United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Applications of Space Techniques to Prevent and Combat Natural Disasters was one of the activities of the Programme for 1995 that were endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.
The Workshop was organized in cooperation with the Government of Zimbabwe.
It was hosted by the Environment and Remote Sensing Institute (ERSI) and held at Harare, from 22 to 26 May 1995, for participants from developing countries of the region covered by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
The objectives of the Workshop were (a) to expose the participants, particularly managers of emergency response agencies, to ways and means of utilizing space technology (remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite communications, positioning by satellites) to prevent or mitigate the effects of natural disasters; and (b) to address the development of databases and their use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prevent disasters or to monitor, mitigate and redress the effects of disasters when they occur.
The presentations to the Workshop covered the use of remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite positioning systems and satellite communications and how they could be used, separately or collectively, to prevent disasters or to forecast, monitor and mitigate the effects of severe weather phenomena, such as flooding, desertification and drought.
The presentations also addressed the extent to which the same technologies could mitigate the effects of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Workshop concluded with discussions on the needs of the emergency response services, the capabilities of space technology to satisfy those needs and the actions that would be necessary in the short- and medium-term to take advantage of those capabilities.
The participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.
B. Organization and programme of the Workshop The participants were professionals with several years experience in managerial positions with national and regional emergency response agencies and services.
Other participants had several years experience in remote sensing, satellite meteorology and the use of databases such as GIS.
Sixty-nine experts from 18 States Members of the United Nations and eight international and regional organizations participated in the Workshop; 44 participants represented 14 developing countries from the ECA region.
The Workshop was attended by participants from the following countries and international organizations: Benin, Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Presentations were made by experts from Ghana, France, Japan, Norway, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America and Zimbabwe; from European Space Agency (ESA), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (regional delegation for Southern Africa), International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations/International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UNDHA/IDNDR), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, as well as by a representative of the Globalstar satellite communications company.
Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA were used to defray the air travel and per diem expenses of 14 participants from 11 developing countries of the ECA region.
The Government of Zimbabwe, through ERSI, provided the conference facilities and the Government also provided local transportation for all participants in the Workshop.
The programme of the Workshop (annex I), was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA.
The Workshop held plenary and working group meetings.
At the latter, the participants discussed the issues related to the use of space technologies to prevent and combat the effects of natural disasters.
The working papers of these groups are given in annexes II-V.
A. Observations of the Workshop The critical factors that distinguish natural phenomena from natural disasters are loss of life and property.
Certainly, humans cannot prevent the occurrence of natural phenomena such as typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Their disastrous effects, however, can be lessened significantly if well-conceived disaster-response plans and mitigation strategies are in place prior to their occurrence.
The Workshop noted that developing countries were particularly subject to natural disasters on a scale that overwhelmed the capacity of the societies concerned to cope with their aftermath.
In many cases, just one such destructive episode was sufficient to destroy the social and economic infrastructure, including the communications network.
A single major disaster could disrupt the distribution of food and water supplies, medical services, and both the local and international communication links of the stricken communities.
The Workshop noted that many of the national and regional emergency response agencies and services were not aware of the full spectrum of applications of space technology. Of particular concern was the lack of awareness of the Earth observing systems that could provide essential data for the prevention of disasters or for the mitigation and relief of their effects.
To a lesser degree, the same observations applied to satellite communications, particularly regarding recent developments in mobile communications.
In the case of natural disasters, such technology could restore communications with the local headquarters for rescue and relief operations as well as with the outside world.
During the last session of the Workshop, the participants defined four categories of disaster-related topics that needed to be addressed: data supply, information generation, decision-making and implementation/execution.
To develop outlines of recommendations that could be useful in disaster-related activities, the participants assigned themselves to one of the above groups according to their professional background. II. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
In recent years, the frequency and magnitude of major disasters, whether of a natural, technological or ecological origin, have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities.
Particularly hard hit are developing countries, for which the magnitude of disasters frequently outstrips the ability of the society to cope with them.
It was stated that this was due to the fact that 95 per cent of all disasters occurred in developing countries.
Over the past 20 years, the frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased.
Over this timespan, 3 million people have been killed and 1 billion have been affected by natural disasters.
Hardly a week goes by without a major disaster.
Since the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, in January 1995, there have been over 20 large disasters reported in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Civil strife, such as the recent events in Rwanda, also affects people, the economy and the infrastructure in ways similar to a very large natural disaster.
To date, relief continues to be the main form of disaster management.
Approximately 95 per cent of all resources spent on disaster-related activities are for relief and recovery operations.
Nevertheless, disasters can be reduced if adequate research and proven prevention, preparedness and emergency measures are taken.
The effects of disasters can only be reduced through the deployment of the very best systems and knowledge, and following well-prepared overall national and regional contingency plans.
A single hazardous event can destroy the social and economic infrastructure, including communications systems, that may have taken years to develop and upon whose vitality local and national economies depend.
Even in normal times, particularly in developing countries, the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes, and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution, water supplies, health-care services, waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world.
In order to realize their fullest potential, developing countries need a sustained period of social and economic growth.
Major impediments to sustained growth are disasters, which often result in an affected country shifting its economic policies to sustain the energy required to cope with disaster response and subsequent reconstruction.
These shifts can intensify a country's financial imbalances and deplete available resources.
In many cases such a situation can be prevented.
Frequently, the difference between saving and losing lives and property is an effective warning of an impending disaster.
Timely warning of a major natural hazard can reduce its consequences: at least, people may have enough time to save their lives; at most, they have an opportunity to relocate or otherwise protect their property.
A. The role of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
and the contribution of space technology The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) 1990-1999 operates within the framework of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations and was proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 44/236 of 22 December 1989 with the objective of reducing, by concerted international action, especially in developing countries, the loss of life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes, windstorms, tsunamis, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, infestations of grasshoppers and locusts, droughts and desertification, and other calamities of natural origin.
The IDNDR secretariat recognizes that space technologies, including remote sensing, global positioning and satellite communications systems, offer disaster managers valuable tools that can be used to prepare for, mitigate and, in some cases, prevent the effects of disasters.
Appropriate applications of space technologies can also be used to respond more effectively to needs resulting from disasters.
IDNDR provides an international mechanism to focus attention on the benefits of applying these and other technologies.
Importantly, it directs the disaster management community beyond the issue of simply using state-of-the-art space technologies in disaster relief and early warning because it promotes a recognition that the national infrastructures that make possible these applications must be encouraged and supported.
Because of the typically high infrastructure investment that is required for constructing and managing space-based programmes, national, and local, systems are out of reach for most of the countries hardest hit by natural disasters.
Therefore, the IDNDR secretariat is seeking ways of encouraging the development of cooperative approaches for sharing space-based resources.
Although the sovereignty of the country affected by the disaster should be recognized, the planning and administration of this process must also include recipient countries.
The development of an autonomous basic research capability in scientific and technical disciplines, including space-related fields, should be a main goal as advocated in ongoing activities within the United Nations, most notably through the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
Such capability would promote creative thinking to adapt, modify and create new technologies that could contribute to national development and the reduction of casualties and property damage.
B. Regional disaster-related problems and projects
There are many disaster-reduction challenges confronting Southern Africa, the major hazards of concern being drought, epidemics, cyclones and storms, floods and armed conflict.
In 1991 and 1992, more than 20 million people in this region were defined as severely drought affected.
Drought in this region is also associated with other hazards, such as flash floods and epidemic diarrhoea, including cholera and dysentery.
In 1995 there have been flash floods in Botswana, northern Namibia and parts of Southern Africa.
Unfortunately, for Southern Africa, cholera and dysentery constitute a serious threat.
In 1993, more than 50,000 cases of cholera and up to 73,000 cases of shizella dysentery were recorded in five Southern African countries.
In 1994, more than 171,000 cases of dysentery were reported for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, claiming nearly 600 lives.
Irrespective of whether the hazard is meteorological, such as a cyclone, epidemiological, such as a cholera outbreak, or hydrological, such as a drought, Southern Africa's most disaster prone communities are those already vulnerable due to poverty, isolation, and dependence on degraded land and location in crowded informal settlements.
Disaster reduction is synonymous with lowering this vulnerability, a daunting challenge facing Southern African governments during a time of fiscal restraint and economic structural adjustment.
In Zimbabwe, remote sensing and GIS projects started as small disjointed donor-funded projects that were designed to test the applicability of the technology in different fields of application.
The earliest pilot projects were in the fields of land-use planning and vegetation monitoring.
At that time, satellite data came in as computer compatible tapes in the diplomatic baggage of the technical personnel from donor countries.
In 1987, ERSI was inaugurated as a service centre to spearhead advances in the use of remote sensing and GIS technology.
The facility was set up as a joint project between the governments of Zimbabwe and Germany.
With time, it was realized that there was a need to coordinate the projects that were being developed all over the country in order to take advantage of already existing data sets, hardware and software to rationalize human and technical resources.
The research council of Zimbabwe established a subcommittee on remote sensing in an attempt to coordinate remote sensing activities in the country.
A working group on GIS was also established.
ERSI is presently involved in capacity building, both in-house and within the existing and new-user community.
The limited success in the control of land degradation and desertification may be attributed to a number of factors that include lack of data relating to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem.
High-resolution satellite remote sensing data is suitable for the collection of spatial data for broad planning and monitoring.
The possibility of assessing in particular the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem of desertification is enhanced.
In Ghana, the most extensive use of high resolution satellite data to map current land use and cover for the country is currently taking place within the Remote Sensing Applications Unit of the Department of Geography, University of Ghana.
The project is using satellite image data to map land use at the scale of 1:250,000 as a part of the Environmental Information Systems Development component of the Ghana Environmental Resources Management Project (GERMP).
GERMP is part of the implementation of the Environmental Action Plan prepared by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The other sets of data to be produced include topography, meteorology, soil suitability and land ownership.
These databases are expected to be available by 1997 to be organized into an environmental database that will be developed and shared in an environmental information systems network.
The Desertification Control Unit within EPA will be expected to use the maps to assess the medium-term and longer term effects of the many environmental and land-use programmes and projects currently being undertaken in all the ecological zones of the country, but particularly in the northern savannahs.
In the United Republic of Tanzania, recurring fire hazards, whether natural or human-made, have swept the vegetation off of various areas of the country except in the very wet rain forest.
Deliberate or accidental fires have had disastrous effects on the ecology and economy of the areas concerned.
In developing countries such as the United Republic of Tanzania, however, the deliberate burning of vegetation continues to aid farming and hunting of game in forested areas.
The impact of fire on forest land can be detected by using remote sensing techniques and GIS.
With respect to technology management, the latest GIS programs, IDRISI and TOSCA, have already been introduced in the United Republic of Tanzania through the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR).
It may be concluded that remote sensing images are a useful database source when used in conjunction with sufficient ground surveys in combating forest fires.
In 1992 a project was initiated in South Africa to develop a monitoring system for drought and vegetation conditions.
This operation requires information at regular intervals at a national level.
The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument carried by satellites of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America is the only commercial data source available to satisfy the needs and requirements of a fully operational exercise of this magnitude.
Unique properties, such as daily coverage of a large area, facilitate regular inventories to be made of natural events on a national scale.
Daily NOAA/AVHRR satellite images are used as a primary input source to produce monthly inventories of the whole country in the form of vegetation index maps.
Analyses and comparisons of current and historical maps enable the objective assessment of the effect of prevailing or emerging drought conditions in a timely fashion.
With proper calibration and the establishment of a continuous long-term database, this information will become a strong tool for decision makers and land managers.
C. Current and future possibilities for satellite communications
Traditional terrestrial telecommunications, particularly in remote areas of disaster-prone countries, have been costly to install, difficult to repair and vulnerable to damage.
Accordingly, such systems have been virtually useless in areas where geography or climate have inhibited their installation and maintenance, and thus have been of limited value to disaster managers.
Fixed satellite services, though useful in disaster planning and warning, have been of relatively limited effectiveness in disaster response, principally because of the need for large receiving and transmitting antennas and their associated high power requirement, and vulnerability to effects of disasters.
Mobile satellite services have been one of the most recent and dynamic communications technologies available to disaster managers.
This low-cost communication capability has proven, even in the relatively short time of its commercial availability, to offer dramatic results in relief efforts that have not been possible before.
Furthermore, as a complement to remote sensing and the global positioning system (GPS), space technology and GIS information management applications, mobile satellite services have the capability to dramatically improve risk assessment, disaster preparedness, early warning, and onset and post-disaster relief operations.
These services are now available to areas previously considered inaccessible because of their location, terrain, weather or demography.
In the future, global mobile communications systems, such as the many planned low Earth orbit (LEO) systems, will greatly enhance the disaster mitigation efforts of relief organizations.
Providing truly global personal communications, these systems, including the proposed Globalstar system, will provide a wide array of opportunities for information exchange through voice, digital data transfer and paging.
An alternate, or back-up capability, will also be provided to ground-based emergency alerting and local services for immediate reporting and request for assistance capabilities in natural disasters, accidents and other emergencies as well as aviation and marine navigation.
A few years ago the mobile satellite technologies that had for so long been employed on an experimental basis were only then beginning to be used in institutions.
Mobile satellite services offering land, aeronautical and maritime mobile communications are now being used regularly in disaster applications and will be used increasingly throughout the 1990s and beyond.
The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective, affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented.
Because mobile satellite communications systems are independent of the local telecommunications infrastructure, they are not affected by natural disasters and they are frequently the only means of communications to and from a stricken area.
The Inmarsat satellite system can be used in all phases of dealing with natural disasters, monitoring and prediction, warning, and early intervention and emergency operations, and can also provide communications support for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a disaster strikes.
The 1994 IDNDR World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, held at Yokohama, Japan, identified telecommunications and information systems as two of the main elements of its "Strategy for a safer world and plan of action", which was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/22 B of 20 December 1994.
The Tampere Conference in 1991, as well as the World Conference on Telecommunications Development of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), held at Buenos Aires in 1994 and the subsequent Kyoto Plenipotentiary Conference, endorsed the principle of maximum use of existing satellite and terrestrial telecommunications systems for disaster mitigation.
This includes the preparation of national disaster emergency and contingency plans, establishment of pools of expertise and equipment for such purposes, inclusion of emergency telecommunications systems in national development plans and revision of national regulatory policies to allow effective deployment of telecommunications in disasters and emergencies.
National contingency plans can help to minimize the impact of sudden natural disasters, for example by the pre-positioning of emergency supplies and communications equipment, including satellite communications systems, at strategic locations such as government premises and hospitals in areas known to be at risk.
As the process of identifying needs and the subsequent funding and deployment of satellite communications systems can take months, such activity has to be started as soon as possible.
For slowly developing disasters, such as droughts or famines, a different telecommunications strategy is needed.
The impact of disasters on sustainable development has been shown to be very severe.
As telecommunications are one of the essential tools for disaster management, the national emergency or disaster management planners need to consider how best to use the available networks and systems during the research and monitoring phase, as well as for contact with established international aid agencies during the relief phase.
Preparedness planning for all disasters and emergencies involves national civil defence, emergency response organizations and various government departments.
The military is increasingly called on to contribute in this role.
The International Committee of the Red Cross and other health organizations also participate.
An increasing number of preparations are being conducted on a regional basis.
While the levels of technical ability and understanding of technology of local personnel are steadily increasing, the main problem is lack of funds.
This, however, can often be overcome by international cooperation or external funding.
Monitoring weather and climate has long been an invaluable tool in predicting and combating natural disasters.
Inmarsat satellite communications systems help in the gathering and dissemination of meteorological data.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, has been using the Inmarsat-C data messaging service to send observation data from ships at sea via Inmarsat Land Earth Stations in Southbury and Goonhilly in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
This global network of observatories using Inmarsat systems contributes to the prediction and monitoring of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons and other variables affecting maritime weather.
Under the auspices of its Regional Centre for Training and Applications in Agrometeorology and Operational Hydrology (AGRHYMET) programme, WMO has recently established a network of land-based monitoring stations in western Africa.
A regional centre is located in Niger.
Observation posts in nine countries, each of them equipped with an Inmarsat-A portable satellite communication system, report regularly on climate and soil conditions in real-time, complementing GIS and remote sensing data.
Such information enables better medium- and long-range planning of agriculture and forestry activities, and helps more effective mitigation in an area covering millions of square kilometres.
UNEP is another Inmarsat user in Africa.
Inmarsat terminals coupled with appropriate sensors provide supervisory control and data acquisition.
Such equipment can play a vital role in providing or improving the monitoring and early warning functions, even from the most remote areas.
The monitoring of geothermal and volcanic variables, tectonic-plate movement and pressure ridges helps to identify potential volcanic or earthquake activity.
The United Nations has also recognized the utility of Inmarsat portable satellite communications systems.
Its United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams, dispatched to a disaster site within hours, routinely carry messaging or phone/fax satcoms when assessing disasters.
Their timely reports help to mobilize experts, supplies and equipment during the crucial 24-72 hours after disaster strikes.
The media also uses Inmarsat systems to report on disasters, especially for the transmission of compressed and slow-scan videos, still pictures and direct, high-quality audio broadcasts.
The media play a big part in highlighting a country's plight, which can help to expedite external assistance.
However, it is not only the media who need accurate and timely information.
During the acute phase of an emergency, speedy and accurate transmission of all relevant information is a major requirement for effective work by disaster relief organizations.
Lists and reports can be compiled quickly and transmitted via mobile satellite communications systems to disaster relief coordinators and other agencies using existing software programs for the management of personnel and supplies.
Immediately following a disaster, field workers in their vehicles or trucks carrying relief supplies often become immobilized due to local conditions.
Therefore, regular communications and position reporting is highly desirable.
Using Inmarsat mobile satellite communications systems and GPS, operations control is able to monitor the progress and location of all equipped vehicles, as well as send messages to them, regardless of the state of the local infrastructure, weather conditions and other impediments.
The introduction by INTELSAT of the new demand assignment multiple access (DAMA) service, especially for thin-route communications, will enhance connectivity in devastated areas. It will make digital satellite public switched services available to more users, especially in rural and remote areas.
DAMA is a flexible, pay-as-you-use service, offering improved connectivity at a low cost, while providing a complete digital solution for thin-route operators.
INTELSAT plans to introduce thin-route DAMA in April 1996 on a global transponder on the INTELSAT 605 at 24.5o east covering its Atlantic Ocean region.
This means that all gateway stations equipped with DAMA will be able to communicate with each other.
Implementation of DAMA service in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions is expected shortly thereafter.
DAMA will benefit all users of the system, particularly those in developing countries.
INTELSAT expects DAMA to be of great benefit in re-establishing communications after natural disasters.
By bringing in fly-away transportable antennas, it will be possible to instantaneously re-establish contact with the rest of the world on the DAMA network.
In 1959, when Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) was created to provide technical information and assistance to individuals and groups in developing countries, the first inquiries came from Africa.
Africa is still the principal user of the VITA Inquire Service.
VITA also supplies information on natural disasters and human-made crises such as civil strife and refugee movements.
In 1987, VITA established its Disaster Information Center.
One of the services provided by the Center is a telephone hotline.
When called on by the Government of the United States of America for assistance in responding to a disaster, within one day VITA activates its telephone bank, selects and trains volunteers, and begins to record offers and donations of medicine and other commodities.
The VITA hotline has provided information on civil strife, floods, cyclones, food shortages, earthquakes, droughts and rains in Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Southern Africa, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.
VITA has identified that one of the major needs for development is reliable communications and that the principal global telecommunications operators have little interest in providing service in most developing countries.
Therefore, VITA has developed its own communications programmes, which includes LEO satellites (VITASAT), terrestrial digital radio networks (VITAPAC) and electronic mail services (VITANET).
The VITA electronic bulletin board, VITANET, is a multi-line, commercial grade system that allows for on-line database searching, access to training materials, computer conferences, on-line surveys and file transfer utilities, all of which are enormously useful during a disaster and for disaster preparedness activities.
VITANET software interfaces will make it possible to link the VITA satellite system and packet radio networks, so that fully-automated end-to-end communications are possible.
In September 1994, VITA installed its own direct Internet host.
To date, the disaster ListServ has 129 subscribers who have received approximately 20,000 documents.
In addition, more than 12,000 documents were picked up through the its gopher.
The VITASAT global electronic messaging network is a satellite-based communications system for commercial, government and non-profit users worldwide.
It utilizes LEO store-and-forward satellites in polar orbit.
This system will provide large message and file transfers over 9.6 kilobits per second (kbps) links and offers two basic services: e-mail/fax transmission, and supervisory control and data acquisition.
Local people need to be made aware of the situation and local relief agencies, such as fire or ambulance services, need to be alerted.
If help is organized by international relief agencies, this should also be known to the local population.
There are various methods for broadcasting information to the area affected by a disaster.
It is possible, for example, to receive information directly from a satellite or for messages to be passed via cellular networks.
However, the equipment to receive such information is normally only available to relatively prosperous sections of the community and as a result the coverage would be somewhat uneven.
The most commonly available receiving equipment is the transistor radio.
It has been estimated that there are over two billion radios in use, with nearly half of those being in the developing countries.
A system that could address a large proportion of these radios seems to have the best chance of achieving a high penetration.
Broadcasting directly to these receivers must be done by terrestrial means.
This can most conveniently and economically be achieved by use of the FM/VHF bands of frequencies, for which most transistor radios are already equipped.
Distribution of the signal to the area concerned is most conveniently carried out by satellite.
Existing satellite capacity is available and can be leased for this purpose.
The receiving equipment for the satellite signal can be a relatively simple receive-only Earth station with a 2.4 m antenna and a 64 kbps link.
WMO already uses such a system and it can easily be extended for disaster applications.
The information received by the station can be disseminated directly to the local population through transistor radios or directed to the local emergency services, as appropriate.
Each receiver/transmitter combination has a coverage area of 40 kms in diameter in flat terrain.
D. Use of data from remote sensing satellites
Remote sensing has become an important source of geographic information on current land cover and land use needed for rational development and sustainable management of agricultural and forestry resources and for environmental protection.
Users have to compromise to fit their information requirements to the parameters of available remote sensing data.
Furthermore, the countries that have the most pressing need for remote sensing do not have the resources to build the necessary capacities for its efficient use.
The increasing volumes of image data that are generated or the number of image products that are sold should not be used as a measure to gauge the success of satellite remote sensing.
The ultimate criterion of its success will be the extent to which remote sensing will have contributed to the quality of life on Earth.
Greater international effort should made to apply new remote sensing and GIS capacities where they are needed most: for monitoring environmental degradation and for implementing programmes for the sustainable management of natural resources in order to safeguard them for future generations.
Particular attention should be given to the needs of developing countries and to strengthening their national remote sensing and GIS capacities.
The Regional Remote Sensing Project (RRSP) of FAO is a component of the Early Warning System for the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region.
Output from this project is fed into the combined physical and socio-economic data used by the Regional Early Warning Unit (REWU) and the Household Food Security Project.
The main objective of the present phase of the project is to strengthen national and regional capabilities in the area of remote sensing for early warning and food security by the establishment of an operational information system.
As such, RRSP is developing national capacities for the analysis and interpretation of coarse-resolution satellite imagery and for the subsequent generation of information products.
At present, satellite data processed by the project and the resulting information products are sent to the contact points and a number of users in the SADC region using mail courier services.
The current phase of the project will see specific attention being given to the transfer of the processing technology to the principal contact points in the countries.
To support this, e-mail links are being established between RRSP, REWU and meteorological services in the SADC countries.
Finally, the project will establish a low-cost integrated satellite data acquisition system for NOAA and METEOSAT data in Harare.
Geologists, engineers, industrialists and planners are now more frequently using remote sensing in the evaluation of hazard situations.
In hazard prevention studies, the interpretation of satellite data together with the analysis of geological records make it possible to reconstruct a historical overview of the occurrence of damaging events.
This information can be used statistically to make a prognosis of potential risk in the occurrence of a catastrophe or for the production of thematic maps that show the spatial context in which hazards occur.
Remote sensing is not only used in preventive studies, but also in the monitoring of dynamic geological processes such as terrain deformation, neotectonic activities and flooding.
Recently, a new technique using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data, called radar interferometry, has been introduced in the analysis of vertical displacement associated with fault movements.
On 17 July 1991, ESA launched the first European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1), a polar orbiting satellite that constituted a major development in remote sensing applications by providing new tools for assisting in natural disasters monitoring and relief.
ERS-2 was launched on 21 April 1995 in order to ensure continuity of data acquisition.
However, since ERS-1 is still fully operational, the two satellites are operated by ESA in a tandem mode that provides a unique opportunity for several applications.
The two ERS satellites provide a wealth of radar information for many applications.
They are both equipped with several microwave sensors as well as an optical radiometer.
The main radar equipment is the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which can be operated in an imaging mode as a side-looking SAR, thereby providing high-resolution image data in C-band (5.3 GHz) at regional scales.
Because microwave radiation suffers very little attenuation in passing through clouds and rainfall (except very heavy thunderstorms), the ERS-1 and ERS-2 SARs provide images of the tropical areas that heretofore could not be thoroughly mapped with LANDSAT and SPOT because of the constant presence of clouds in the region.
Furthermore, the complementarity between optical and radar images of the same area has already proven to be an excellent and powerful tool for advanced applications and an asset in natural disaster monitoring and relief.
On a global scale, the ERS-1 AMI SAR is operated as a wave scatterometer over water to generate SAR "imagettes" of 6 km x 5 km along the SAR swath at 200 km intervals.
Through the analysis of the imagette spectrum, operational worldwide information on the wave systems, namely wave height and wave direction, is derived.
Such products are disseminated within three hours from data sensing to nominated centres through the global meteorological network for subsequent assimilation into numerical analysis and forecast models.
The ERS-1 AMI can also be operated as a wind scatterometer to provide wind vectors at the ocean surface on a 25 km grid.
Sea surface backscattering signals of radar pulses emitted at three different side-looking angles are measured on board and then elaborated on the ground through a C-band model to generate surface vectors with the same accuracy for conventional ground measurements.
Like the ERS SAR wave data, AMI wind vectors are also disseminated operationally through the global telecommunication system.
Data from the ERS wind scatterometer are of particular help in the tropical region, in the southern hemisphere and in the northern Pacific Ocean because of the very limited amount of available statistical data on these areas.
ERS-1 radar altimeter data provide worldwide surface information.
Several measurements are derived at a global scale from backscattered signals of downward emitted radar pulses, including the height of sea and ice surfaces, the height of sea waves and the wind speed at the sea surface.
Additional geodetic and climatological information is generated from the former, which leads to the availability of some important climatic change indicators, such as anomalies in ocean topography (e.g. el Ni√±o and la Ni√±a) or in ice melting (e.g. Antarctic caps).
The precise range and range rate equipment (PRARE), operational on ERS-2, allows precise orbit calculations to be made and accurate corrections to radar altimeter measurements to be implemented.
In addition, ERS satellites carry an along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR), a dual instrument constituted by an optical and a passive microwave radiometer.
The optical radiometer on ERS-1 works in four infrared spectral bands, at 1.6, 3.7, 11 and 12 micrometers; three visible channels have been added to the ERS-2 version.
Very accurate sea surface temperature measurements are provided globally on a 50 km grid, with an intrinsic original 1 km spatial and 0.1 K radiometric resolution.
A dual viewing, oblique at 50 degrees ahead and vertical, together with internal black-body calibration leads to very accurate atmospheric corrections.
The visible channels added to the ERS-2 radiometer allow the derivation of vegetation indices.
The ATSR Microwave Sounder is a dual frequency passive radiometer, whose data are used primarily to correct radar altimeter measurements and to determine the atmospheric vapour content.
High-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) is an important tool for increasing the efficiency during the planning and implementation phases of refugee work relief operations.
Until recently, the highest resolution satellite images commercially available have been 10 m resolution SPOT images.
Currently, images with 2 m resolution obtained from Russian military satellites are commercially available.
This information can be used to obtain estimates of refugee-camp population, area and growth rates.
The interpretation of such high-resolution images should be strongly linked to the United Nations in order to utilize already established communication lines with relief agencies.
In the near future, sensors with ground resolution down to 1 m will be commercially available.
The data distribution systems of these satellites will be vastly improved in comparison to the present ones.
However, an unfortunate trend might be seen in the data distribution plans of some commercial companies that intend to offer exclusive rights to the customers on a first-come, first-served basis, denying access to the images for late customers.
It is therefore important for the United Nations to play an active role in forming policies to distribute HRSI.
Data from satellite-based radar systems can also be used in many ways for natural hazard reduction.
The most conventional use of radar data is the recognition of flooded areas by the dark signature of still water in a radar image associated with the all-weather capability of the instrument.
The 1 m accuracy of the models created by ERS-1 data is unmatched by other space-based techniques.
The dense spatial samplings (100 pixels/sq km) provided by radar interferometry in the detection of displacements associated with its accuracy (in the range of 3-10 mm) make it an important tool for assessing most natural hazards.
This tool could be used as a cheap warning signal in the case of volcanoes, as was demonstrated in the case of the recent activity at Mount Etna.
The ERS-1 satellite can also provide the data required for global monitoring of all potentially hazardous volcanoes.
Radar interferometry can also contribute to the understanding of earthquakes, especially in poorly equipped areas because it does not require ground instrumentation.
Some current limitations of these techniques are linked to the physics of the atmosphere, the contribution of which can only be separated by the analysis of multiple image pairs and the change of the surface state in long periods of time that spoils the interference patterns.
A high throughput system such as ERS-1 proved capable of delivering the many images required.
Other limitations come from the features of current space-borne radar instruments, which were not designed for this purpose.
The experience gained could be of help when designing better systems in the future.
However, the built-in design margins of ERS-1 permit its operational use in the field of interferometry, for which it was not initially designed.
E. A global monitoring and warning satellite system
The Japanese Space Agency, NASDA, is emphasizing the development of data analysis technology for a variety of applications including natural disaster reduction.
For the development of technology for data application in the field of natural disaster reduction, NASDA is considering cooperative research projects, such as the Global Earth Observation System (GEOS), the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), with the international user community for the verification of algorithms to be applied to actual case-studies.
NASDA is also planning to reflect user requirements in the field of natural disaster reduction to future programmes.
The purpose of the World Environment and Disaster Observation System (WEDOS) and the Global Disaster Observation System (GDOS) of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. is to provide continuous operational monitoring of the Earth's environment in order to detect and mitigate natural disasters and human-induced accidents.
A total of 26 remote sensing satellites will be launched into low altitude, sun synchronous and circular orbits together with 12 (6 in-orbit spares) data relay satellites in geostationary orbit.
The monitoring of short-term changes is indispensable to the prevention of disasters and that type of monitoring could be accomplished by using existing technologies.
Both systems therefore concentrate on observing environmental changes that occur over short periods (e.g. oil pollution and red tides) and the simultaneous observation of phenomena occurring globally over the surface of Earth (e.g. wind speed and direction of sea surface).
Consequently, any location in the world could be observed by WEDOS at least once a day with 20 m resolution; therefore irregularities and environmental changes can be detected immediately.
More precise observations of the damaged areas, with 2 m resolution, will also be possible several times a day.
GDOS is a modified version of WEDOS, which facilitates the location of disasters and is capable of repeatedly observing a disaster site.
The payloads of the satellite segment of both systems would be designed to monitor the land and ocean environment, the geosphere, hydrosphere and meteorological conditions, with the aid of visible, near infrared, microwave, short-wave and thermal radiometers, synthetic aperture radar, radar altimeter and scattering lidar.
The ground segment would comprise a mission management centre, satellite control centres, a master ground station and local user stations.
Observation data would be received by the master ground station via data relay satellites and would then be recorded and processed.
The processed data would be distributed to each local user station in the world.
To implement any of these two systems it is mandatory to develop an international consensus on the importance of the subject of disasters and to gain support from the general public, scientific community, governmental and United Nations entities that are in charge of the natural environment and disaster prevention.

COMMITTEE ON THE PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE
MICROSATELLITES AND SMALL SATELLITES: CURRENT PROJECTS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
Note by the Secretariat
The Working Group of the Whole to Evaluate the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), at its eighth session (A/AC.105/571, annex II, para. 17), proposed that several studies on space applications should be undertaken by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in view of the recommendations adopted at the workshops, seminars, symposia and conferences organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The Working Group of the Whole identified a number of possible subjects for such studies, including microsatellites and small satellites, current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation.
The report of the Working Group of the Whole was adopted by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session (A/AC.105/571, para. 22), and the recommendations contained therein were endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in its report on the work of its thirty-seventh session1 and by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.
The present study has been prepared by the Secretariat in response to the request of the Working Group of the Whole.
The study, which is available in English only, is presented in the annex to the present note.
The purpose of the study was to give an overview of the rapidly evolving field of small satellites, which should be easily accessible even to countries with limited or newly conceived space programmes.
The study was prepared using a variety of national and international sources that are listed in the selected bibliography at the end of the study.
It was also sent in draft form to external experts for comments.
A summary of the study is provided below.
SUMMARY OF THE STUDY Small satellites have already been used with considerable success by many organizations.
Their attraction lies in the promise of low-cost and short development time, which is made possible by the use of proven standard equipment and techniques, together with a realistic expectation of performance.
The space age began with the launching of small scientific satellites in 1958, the International Geophysical Year. Those satellites were small because of the limited capacity of the first space launchers.
After a modest beginning with small, simple and lightweight satellites, space systems evolved into large, complex and expensive space platforms for scientific research and other applications that often require many years of development prior to launch.
While such large platforms exist and will continue to exist, there has recently been a growing interest in returning to the use of small satellites, which can be launched within a few years after programme initiation.
As a consequence of the evolution of space-related technologies, this class of spacecraft can make significant space capabilities accessible to a wide number of users, ranging from students in secondary schools and universities to engineers and scientists in every country in the world.
In many ways, projects involving small satellites are ideal for extensive international cooperation.
The development of small satellites will not replace that of large satellites, as the goals and issues involved are often different.
Missions involving small satellites can, however, be a complement to large satellite missions.
By exploring new methods and techniques, small satellites can be a tool for pioneering experiments and technologies for future missions involving larger satellites.
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are: more frequent, and a larger variety of, mission opportunities; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base; greater involvement of local industry; and greater diversification of potential users.
Moreover, even a country with a modest research budget and little or no experience with space technology can afford to participate in missions involving small satellites.
Small satellites also offer excellent opportunities for training students, engineers and scientists in different disciplines, including engineering, software development for computers on board and on the ground and management of sophisticated technical programmes.
Recent technological progress in many areas means that small satellites can offer services previously only available from much larger satellites.
Fairly sophisticated scientific and technological experiments, as well as application missions, can be flown in space at modest costs.
The areas of application include: space physics, astronomy, astrophysics, technology demonstrations, communications experiments and acquisition of Earth resource data, including disaster information.
The definition of a small satellite varies, but an upper limit of about 400 kg (in exceptional cases 500 kg) is usually adopted, within which there are two main categories: small satellites (or minisatellites), which weigh about 100-400 kg; and microsatellites, which weigh less than 100 kg.
A typical "small satellite mission", including launch, generally costs less than US$ 20 million and most microsatellite projects cost approximately US$ 3 million.
A central issue in any small satellite mission is the optimum balance between programme complexity and risk.
Small satellites are likely to offer new opportunities for procurement methods.
The selected model philosophies are important in terms of both risk and cost and, as a maximum, a protoflight approach is acceptable for such programmes.
The advantages of small satellites are as follows:
(a) Orbital parameters optimized to individual instrument requirements;
(b) Augmentation of conventional satellite programmes, such as additional capability, redundancy for critical missions, or replacement of a failed instrument;
(c) Missions with limited lifetime and/or coverage requirements;
(d) Improved responsiveness to the end-user (more frequent launch opportunities and increased mission flexibility for individual instruments, plus schedule independence);
(e) Quick-reaction, launch-on-demand launches using low-cost dedicated vehicles (e.g. crisis monitoring, replacement after an in-orbit failure, or monitoring of unexpected environmental conditions);
(f) Relaxed reliability owing to the shorter lifetime or agreed, lower levels of product assurance or lower-quality parts as appropriate to lower development costs;
(g) Reduced satellite design complexity (e.g. simplified interfaces, optimized for instrument requirements), shorter development schedule and suitable test-bed for proving technique and/or technology.
There are three general classes of orbit that may be suitable for small satellites: the geostationary orbit (GSO), the highly elliptical orbit (HEO) and the low Earth orbit (LEO).
GSO is where the satellite appears fixed relative to the ground, thus allowing continuous visibility and simplifying the ground segment and operational requirements.
Because of the large space-to-ground distance involved, however, the data rates are small, or larger ground antennas and higher electrical power on board the spacecraft are required.
This orbit is usually reached from a standard geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) provided by a large launch vehicle.
The use of GTO is interesting as it could benefit from frequent piggyback launch opportunities while avoiding the complexity and extra costs associated with an apogee propulsion system.
LEO is generally preferred for small satellite missions.
Small launch vehicles may be used, offering flexibility in the selection of the orbit parameters; piggyback launches may also be used.
A low-energy transmitter on board is sufficient because of the short distance from the ground, but infrequent and short visibility periods are a drawback, leading to some ground-segment and operational complexity.
A distinction should be made between the near equatorial or low inclination orbits, for which the visibility zone will be limited to the topical zone, and the polar and quasi-polar (Sun-synchronous) orbits that allow accessibility to any point on Earth, either for communication (e.g. store and forward) or for remote sensing of Earth.
The current and future development of small satellites is closely linked to the appearance of new, low-cost launchers (Pegasus, Taurus etc.) and lower-cost launch opportunities on existing vehicles (for example, Ariane-4 or small canisters on the Space Shuttle).
The potential availability of cheap launchers has spurred much of the recent surge of interest in small satellites, which was initially driven largely by defence and global civil communication programmes of the United States of America.
Of the major low-cost launchers of European countries and the United States, only Pegasus and Taurus are flight-proven.
Conestoga is planned for flight in the near future, development of the Italian San Marco Scout has not yet started (although its forerunner, the United States Scout, has been operated for many years) and the Ariane-5 derivative programme should be completed in 1999.
In order to maximize their potential, small launcher developers must apply the same innovative, low-cost design approach used on small satellites.
Launch costs represent a large portion of total programme costs (generally over 25 per cent) and satellite mass and size must therefore be constrained to take full advantage of low-cost launch opportunities.
Options include:
(a) Small dedicated launchers;
(b) Multiple launch of several small satellites, nominally on Ariane-4 or Ariane-5 for European missions (e.g. Cluster scientific satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA));
(c) Flight opportunities on larger launchers (Arianespace has strongly promoted its vehicles for this purpose, with Ariane-4 offering: Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP) for piggyback microsatellites (up to six 50 kg satellites (300 kg total)); Ariane Radioamateur Satellite Enseignement Espace (ARSENE)-type configuration for satellites of up to 200 kg; and SPELDA Dedicated Satellite (SDS) for satellites in the range of 400-800 kg within the short Ariane Dual Launch External Bearing Structure (SPELDA) adapter.
Similar options are provided by other medium-sized or large launchers, for example, the United States Atlas Centaur and the Delta-2.
Requirements for the ground segment of a small satellite system vary enormously depending on the application area.
At one extreme, low data rate sensors with only local or regional coverage on missions with low tracking and command requirements impose relatively low demands on the ground segment, possibly comprising only 10 per cent or less of total programme costs.
More complex data retrieval and processing requirements could result in ground segment costs of up to 50 per cent of total programme costs.
Assuming that ground segment costs tend to average 25 per cent of total programme costs, it is clearly important to identify potential savings in the ground segment in concert with those of the space segment.
In attempting to reduce the ground segment costs, there are limits on simplification because it is still necessary to ensure the achievement of capabilities such as reliable operation, rapid response to critical commands and regular form of data on time and with low loss. The ground segment model, which forms the basis of any technical and cost assessments, must include not just the provision of the ground stations, but also ground communications infrastructure, mission control etc.
Very small, in some cases transportable, stations have been made commercially available by several suppliers in European countries and in the United States.
Commercial providers of remote sensing data are likely to press for the adoption of such approaches in attempts to reduce the cost of distributing and processing the data.
Space science activities are obviously valuable, and most space-faring nations have begun their involvement in this field with small scientific satellites.
The first small scientific satellite of Argentina will be the Scientific Applications Satellite (SAC-B), which is being developed jointly by its national space agency, the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States.
The 190 kg satellite is to be launched in 1996 by a Pegasus rocket into a circular orbit of 550 km with an inclination of 37 degrees.
SAC-B will be inertially stabilized and permanently oriented to the Sun.
It will monitor energetic X-rays from solar flares and survey the sky with X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors along an axis perpendicular to the Sun line.
Between 1978 and 1991, scientific microsatellites weighing 15-50 kg were developed for the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MAGION) research programme in the former Czechoslovakia.
MAGION-1 was launched on 24 October 1978 as a subsatellite of the INTERCOSMOS-18 geophysical satellite.
Although it was designed for an operational lifetime of three weeks, MAGION-1 remained operational for three years.
MAGION-2 and MAGION-3 were launched into high-inclination low-eccentricity orbits (with an altitude of 500-3,200 km) as part of the ACTIVE and Ariane Passengers Experiment (APEX) mother-daughter active space missions launched on 28 September 1989 and on 18 December 1991, respectively.
The MAGION-4 subsatellite was successfully launched by a Molniya launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk, Russian Federation, on 3 August 1995, as part of the INTERBALL-tail mission.
MAGION-5 is currently scheduled for a 1996 launch.
The Central European Satellite for Advanced Research (CESAR) is a spacecraft of about 300 kg that will fly in an orbit with a perigee of 400 km, an apogee of 1,000 km and an inclination of 70 degrees.
The scientific mission is related to the study of the magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere of Earth.
This mission is one of the objectives of the cooperation among the countries of the Central European Initiative.
Space industry and research institutions in Finland have acquired experience in satellite payloads and instrumentation through their associate membership in ESA and have long been active in remote sensing and other space-related disciplines.
To initiate a study of a Finnish small satellite (FS-1), Finnish institutes defined their interests by contacting selected institutes with an unofficial announcement of opportunity and by asking for proposals.
After the proposal phase, system design was performed for two alternatives: a scientific satellite and an Earth observation satellite.
Each satellite would contain a technology demonstration package in which new electronic components would be tested in the space environment.
The French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) is currently considering the following small scientific satellites:
(a) Mission SAMBA: registration of the local fluctuations of 3 kelvin radiation from the big bang (similar to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite of the United States) and detailed measurement of possible anisotropies;
(b) Mission COROT: astroseismology, new data on the convection and internal rotation of stars by long-term measurement of stellar oscillations;
(c) Mission IBIZA: registration of the plasma accelerated in the geomagnetic auroral regions, interaction of ionized particles with the ionosphere and magnetosphere of Earth, creation of electromagnetic disturbances;
(d) QUICK-STEP: verification of the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational mass (theory of relativity) with a relative precision of 10-17.
On 3 February 1994, the small satellite of the University of Bremen, BREMSAT, was carried into orbit by the United States Space Shuttle Discovery.
The spacecraft, which weighed 63 kg, waited six days in its Get Away Special (GAS) container before it was deployed into its initial circular orbit of 350 km.
The satellite carried six experiments with different scientific objectives, including heat conductivity under microgravity, micrometeorite and dust particle distribution, atmospheric atomic oxygen mapping and re-entry pressures and temperatures.
The satellite functioned until its in-orbit decay on 12 February 1995.
In developing its indigenous launching capacity, India prepared a series of small technology development and scientific satellites called Rohini and the Stretched Rohini Scientific Satellite (SROSS) series.
The Rohini satellites were launched between 1980 and 1983 and carried a landmark sensor payload including a solid state camera.
More than 2,500 frames in both visible and infrared bands for identification of landmarks and altitude and orbit refinement were obtained. The orbital mass of the Rohini satellites was about 42 kg.
SROSS-C and SROSS-C2 were launched on 20 May 1992 and 4 May 1994, respectively.
They each carry two scientific payloads.
The first is the retarding potential analyser, consisting of two planar detectors to measure plasma parameters and to investigate the energetic structure of the equatorial ionosphere.
The second is the gamma-ray burst experiment, consisting of two scintillation detectors to study celestial gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20-3,000 kilo-electronvolts.
The Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial (INTA) of Spain, situated at Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, has been entrusted by the Government with the direction of a research project for the development of a Spanish space system, called MINISAT.
The system will consist of a multi-purpose platform (service module), payload module and an associated ground segment.
Both the platform and the subsystems comprising it are modular in character.
The platform will be capable of receiving, integrating, operating and carrying on board a payload module by means of standard interfaces.
This will permit all the required adaptations for a particular mission to be easily conducted.
The platform will be able to carry payloads with masses that vary between 80 and 500 kg.
The first of these satellites will be a MINISAT mission carrying a payload module (PLM-1).
The first Swedish-built satellite was the 283 kg Viking, which was launched into low polar orbit in 1986 in a piggyback configuration with the French remote sensing satellite, satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT).
The scientific objective of the Viking satellite was to study ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at high geomagnetic latitudes in the altitude region of up to about two Earth radii.
A more advanced small scientific satellite, called Freja, was launched on 6 October 1992 by a Chinese launcher.
This satellite of 214 kg is designed for auroral research and other related magnetospheric phenomena.
Because Swedish magnetospheric scientists are very interested in the possibilities of small satellites, a compact satellite platform has been developed that is 10 per cent of the mass of the Freja.
This new microsatellite, called Astrid, is shaped like a box with sides measuring approximately 50 x 50 cm and has a mass of 25 kg in its stowed configuration.
It is spin-stabilized with a Sun-pointing capability and deployable solar panels.
The first Astrid was launched on 24 January 1995 from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on a Cosmos launcher.
The best example of the small satellite programmes in the United States is the NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) programme, which provides for frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive science missions.
Each SMEX spacecraft weighs approximately 250 kg and each mission is expected to cost approximately US$ 50 million for design, development and 30 days of in-orbit operations.
The first satellite of this series, the Solar, Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX), was launched on 3 July 1992.
It has been successfully investigating the composition of local interstellar matter and solar material and the transport of magnetospheric charged particles into the atmosphere of Earth.
The Submillimeter-Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) is to be launched on a Pegasus rocket in 1995 or 1996.
Probably the most experienced research unit in the field of microsatellites is the Spacecraft Engineering Research Unit at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Since 1981, UOSAT and, more recently, the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) team have logged over 25 orbit-years of microsatellite operations.
A total of 10 University of Surrey Satellite Project (UOSAT) satellites were launched between 1981 and 1993.
The operational microsatellite S-80/T, which is based upon the UOSAT platform, was launched in August 1992 with a mission objective to explore communication possibilities of the very high frequency World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-92) bands allocated to non-geostationary satellite systems.
The initial mission objective has been successfully achieved.
S-80/T completed its first operational year in October 1993 while continuing its flawless functioning.
Amateur satellites of the UOSAT series are capable of transmitting images of the surface of Earth, as well as meteorological data.
The latest additions to the UOSAT family are a Portuguese satellite (POSAT-1), HEALTHSAT-2 and KITSAT-2, which were launched together in September 1993 aboard Ariane V-59, together with the SPOT-3 commercial remote sensing satellite.
POSAT is the result of close cooperation between SSTL Satellite and a Portuguese industrial consortium.
KITSAT-2 was built in the Republic of Korea by engineers trained by SSTL.
Its platform retains many similarities with S-80/T and KITSAT-1 (launched in August 1992), while some payloads have been developed by engineers of the Republic of Korea.
On 9 February 1993, a Pegasus launcher launched the first Brazilian data collection satellite (SCD-1) with an inclination of 25 degrees and an altitude of 750 km.
SCD-1, designed and built by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) is a small spin-stabilized satellite dedicated to the collection and distribution of environmental data acquired and emitted by data-collecting platforms over Brazilian territory.
Since its launching, SCD-1 has been performing excellently.
The first satellite of an Italian data collection satellite series called the Telespazio Micro Satellite (TEMISAT) was launched by a Russian Tsiklon launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on 31 August 1993, together with a Meteor-2 satellite.
The satellite is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 950 km and with an inclination of 82.5 degrees and an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.0001.
A second unit (TEMISAT-2) was manufactured together with the first one; it is stored on the ground and could be launched to increase the in-orbit service capacity.
Applied to Earth observation missions, small satellites can be utilized independently to fulfil the function of specific payload instruments.
Several can be flown in a constellation to replace or augment the functions of a larger multi-instrumented satellite.
Small satellites will not entirely replace such large platforms, which offer both financial and scientific benefits, such as economies of scale and synergy of measurements.
In addition, large satellites are essential where specific instruments must be large enough to achieve their mission objectives with high power and very high data rates (e.g. depending on the size of radar antenna or optical performance on aperture and focal length).
Potentially suitable Earth observation missions for small satellites include: global ocean sampling (by a constellation of satellites); geophysical sampling (by a single satellite in polar orbit); ocean and coastal zone colour monitoring; single instrument payload in support of larger missions, commercial mapping and land surveys; crisis and/or disaster monitoring (e.g. floods, forest fires, oil spills), launched on demand or into a constellation; and vegetation monitoring for agriculture and forestry.
The recurrent orbit Earth observation satellite project of Japan provides an example of a small satellite that is being used for remote sensing purposes.
By using a recurrent orbit (with a repeating ground track every fifteenth revolution), the observation frequency of the area is greatly improved.
This is the origin of the Domestic Urban Area Observation Satellite (DUOS) concept.
The DUOS system is based on the Optical Intersatellite Communications Engineering Test Satellite, which is currently scheduled to be launched by the J-1 in 1998.
It will have a three-axis stabilized bus with two panels of solar arrays and batteries.
Within the given mass limit, the satellite could carry the Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer and a thermal infrared radiometer.
The long-term goal of the Technical University of Berlin Satellite (TUBSAT) programme is the development of a three-axis stabilized observation platform that can be autonomously oriented to any desired direction with arc minute accuracy.
Of primary interest is the remote sensing of Earth, so that precise stabilization is required both for observation and for a high data transmission rate to permit real-time or almost real-time reception of the pictures.
These goals are being approached in several steps.
Based on the orbital experience of TUBSAT-A and TUBSAT-B, launched in 1991 and 1994, respectively, instrumentation of the third spacecraft will also include three fibre optic laser gyroscopes.
A preliminary structure of TUBSAT-C has already been manufactured and is being used for three-axis air bearing experiments.
The pre-operational Fire Reconnaissance System (FIRES), recently studied in Germany, will demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of a future operational small satellite system for fire reconnaissance.
It is anticipated to be of use not only for pure detection of a fire event in large areas, but also for its ability to locate the fire, assess the extent (in space and time) and type of the fire and provide this information to local authorities in a timely manner.
In addition to this primary task, the system should be able to solve secondary problems such as assessment of vegetation damage, assessment of atmospheric pollution and evaluation of the revitalization of burned areas.
Furthermore, when the satellite is not over vegetated areas, its sensor system can contribute to other remote sensing tasks related to high temperature detection.
A satellite health network has been proposed for western Africa by a non-profit agency in the United States, Volunteers in Technology Assistance, using a constellation of small LEO communication satellites to link regional medical centres with village clinics and mobile health teams.
Where it would be more economical to do so, two-way radio-telephones would be used to link villages or mobile units to local clinics, which in turn would be linked to a regional centre via satellite.
It has been estimated that 10 microsatellites could be built and launched for about US$ 21 million, while about US$ 30 million would be required for the medical facilities and the Earth station network.
Such a system could dramatically improve the access of rural people to good medical care.
If successful, the experiment would serve as a model for other remote regions.
The recent availability of relatively low-cost launch opportunities has made it conceivable for educational institutions to develop, manufacture, test and operate a small satellite.
There is always an emphasis on the active participation of members of the university community (professors, students, postgraduates), which gives them invaluable practical experience with space technology and scientific research.
For example, the first Spanish microsatellite, UPM/SAT 1, with a mass of 47 kg, has been designed and manufactured by the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.
It is a low-cost platform with a moderately long operational life capable of future evolution.
It was launched on 7 July 1995 as an auxiliary payload of the Ariane-40 rocket carrying the French Helios-1A satellite.
The main experiment on the satellite comprises monitoring of the behaviour of a fluid configuration called liquid bridge in microgravity conditions.
Developing a moderately complex design in a university environment should allow professors and students to get the experience necessary for more complex projects.
The Sunset satellite being developed by graduate students in electronic engineering at Stellenbosch University in South Africa is planned for launch early in 1996.
It is a microsatellite weighing 50 kg that is compatible with an Ariane launcher and is capable of three-colour stereo imaging of Earth.
Pictures can be transmitted in real time or stored on the satellite.
The attitude of the satellite can be controlled within 1 milliradian.
The communications package includes an S-band downlink and amateur radio store and forward communications with an audio repeater to stimulate radio interest among schoolchildren.
The opportunities for small and medium-sized countries to enter into space activities at a relevant level have, in the past, been limited.
In the past decade, however, technological advances in materials and microelectronics, together with the experience gained, have allowed many significant space missions to be performed with small satellites.
In recognition of the importance of this trend for international cooperation in outer space, the International Academy of Astronautics, at its meeting in August 1992, elevated the status of its subcommittee on small satellite programmes to the status of a full committee.
At the same time, a new subcommittee on small satellites for developing nations was created under the auspices of the committee.
It will act as a liaison with the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the International Space University and the International Astronautical Federation, particularly with its Committee for Liaison with International Organizations and Developing Nations.
The long-term goals of the new subcommittee are to promote the use of small satellites for the benefit of developing countries.
An assessment of these benefits is made on a regional basis, starting with the situation in Latin America.
Each assessment is to be prepared during a workshop organized by the subcommittee with representatives of interested countries.
The resulting reports will be published and will serve as a basis for further action.
The first regional workshop was held at S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, Brazil, on 20 to 23 June 1994 at the invitation of INPE.
The eventual success of small satellites and microsatellites is not considered to be in doubt; however, before the full potential of these emerging technologies can be realized, it will be necessary to radically rethink the way missions are specified, realized, funded and operated.
The changing role of international cooperation to this effect should be further explored.
Because of the diverse nature of both applications and instruments, their needs are unlikely to be met with a common small satellite bus design, but more intensive exchange of experience with different designs could eventually lead to some kind of standardization.
The ability to adapt existing hardware readily and cheaply will also be a valuable economic asset for both manufacturer and user.
Among the main difficulties in promoting the use of small satellite technology for developing countries is the fact that the countries with established space programmes frequently do not understand the scope of problems within developing countries and that there is a lack of adequately trained local personnel.
In this context, it would be extremely valuable if the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space would pay more attention to this issue.
It is therefore pertinent that the theme fixed for special attention by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session is "Utilization of microsatellites and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost activities, taking into account the special needs of developing countries".
Based on the results of its deliberations on this special theme, as well as on recommendations contained in the present report, the Committee might propose some ways and means of ensuring substantial progress in international cooperation in this rapidly developing field.
For example, it might recommend that one or more of the educational activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be devoted to the theme of microsatellites and small satellites.

A. Background and objectives The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82) that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should promote the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology for developing countries.
At its thirty-eighth session, in June 1994, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1995, as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session.
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994, endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1995.
The present report contains a summary of the proceedings of the United Nations/International Astronautical Federation Workshop on Space Technology for Health Care and Environmental Monitoring in the Developing World.
Previous symposia and workshops in the series have been held in Austria, Canada, Israel and the United States of America.
The main objective of the Workshop was to provide participants with information on the possibilities offered by current space technologies and to discuss ways in which they could be used in ongoing or planned programmes and projects of the participants.
During the course of the Workshop successful models of space applications were presented.
Through panel discussions, the Workshop developed general principles on how developing countries could use space technologies, including remote sensing and space communications systems for health care, environmental monitoring and economic and social development.
The present report covering the background, objectives and organization of the Workshop, as well as the observations and recommendations made by the participants, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries. B. Participants
The United Nations invited developing countries to participate in the Workshop.
Participants were required to have university degrees in engineering, physics, biological or medical sciences or other fields related to the themes of the Workshop.
The participants were working in programmes, projects or enterprises in which space technology could be utilized.
A few policy makers, at a decision-making level, from both national and international entities were also invited.
Funds allocated by the United Nations, IAF and the other co-sponsors for the Workshop were used to cover international air travel and per diem expenses for the period of the Workshop and the IAF Congress for selected participants from developing countries.
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Workshop: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Mauritania, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Togo, Uganda and Viet Nam; Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO); and Commission of the European Communities, European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), European Space Agency, European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (EUTELSAT), International Astronautical Federation, International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Space University (ISU) and International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).
Speakers, chairmen and participants from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America also took part in the Workshop. I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE WORKSHOP
A. General themes The Workshop featured a series of presentations on relevant space application fields by experts from both developed and developing countries.
A representative from each of the developing countries presented outlines of its national programme.
Three panel discussions preceded open discussion sessions where the participants interacted, providing information, comments, questions, recommendations and suggestions.
It was stressed repeatedly during the meeting that the problem with adopting space technology in developing countries was not with the technology itself, which existed and was readily available.
The problems were regulatory, legal, political, institutional, financial and educational.
It was suggested that a future UN/IAF workshop might focus on that matter and make recommendations to reduce those problems.
The value of space technology to developing countries was clearly recognized by the participants, as was the necessity for stronger regional cooperation and collaboration.
It was also recognized that there was a strong need for more extensive education in the benefits of space technology at all levels, from school children to political leaders.
In particular, school children should be taught subjects related to space science and technology which were most likely to be relevant to the country in future.
Space technology had become an increasingly vital part of everyday life, characterized by growing costs and complexity, which meant that most developing countries must be extremely selective about the scope and pace of their own space activities.
It had been realized that space technology could be a valuable tool for enhancing international security.
For example, a proposal for the use of a constellation of geosynchronous equatorial and polar orbiting satellites, the Global Satellite Network for Education, Tele-health and Disaster Management (GLOSNETAD), was outlined.
GLOSNETAD would be connected by a network of ground stations as a global arrangement for education, health care and disaster management,
The ever-increasing cost of space technologies and participation in space activities made international cooperation absolutely necessary for many countries wishing to benefit from the technology.
The need for international cooperation was therefore repeatedly stressed.
Space technology provided entirely new dimensions to the way in which health care and education could be delivered.
Conventional approaches required a face-to-face relation between the patient and the health-care provider.
That generally meant that patients in remote areas had very limited access to high-quality, specialized medical care.
The telephone and two-way radio had improved the situation by permitting audio communication between health-care persons in a remote area and specialists at a major centre.
However, the equitable availability of high-quality medical care depended upon interactive audio-visual communication that could be provided by space communications technology.
Telehealth was the practice of health care using interactive audio, visual and data communication.
It included health-care delivery, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, communication of data and education of both the doctor and the patient.
Recent advances in technology, especially in video storage, processing, retrieval and transmission had helped to bring telehealth within the reach of a much broader community.
Telehealth was based on the fundamental premise that there should be equitable access to quality health care.
The cost of health care was rising everywhere.
As a function of a country's gross national product (GNP), the cost had shown a steady rise over the years.
Expectations of health care also continued to rise.
However, available resources were declining.
Telehealth could slow the rate of cost increases.
Moreover, it could help to achieve the goal of equitable access.
In about 50 projects that had been followed by WHO, it was found that there were significant savings in travel costs of physicians and patients.
Telehealth had been successfully used for pathology, radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, cardiology and further medical consultations.
In China, the direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology had been critical in public health education and medical instruction in remote areas.
Interactive satellite transmission technology was one of the best and most reliable means of conveying health knowledge to medical workers in rural areas.
Since 1993, the West China University of Medical Sciences had actively participated in developing radio and television programmes providing rural areas with basic information not only on health-care services, but also on epidemic diseases, thereby allowing timely mitigation strategies.
Financial and technological support from developed countries was one of the most important factors in successfully promoting the sharing of benefits of space technology to humankind.
Developing countries should place a higher priority on the active participation in and application of space technology in the fields of health care and education.
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures.
The HealthNet programme was developed in 1989 to cooperatively share information and communications services to support public health and medical research in the developing world.
HealthNet was currently in operation in 15 African and 5 Asian countries.
The original intent was to use low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to reach rural and remote areas.
Five ground stations with a computer, radio and antenna had been established.
The satellites were low cost and could be used for electronic mail, with delivery anywhere in the world within 12 hours.
In an effort to address the problem of the globally unbalanced provision of medical and educational services, participants in the ISU 1994 summer session programme at Barcelona developed a proposal to establish the Global Access to Tele-health and Education System (GATES).
By using advanced communications and information technologies for telehealth and tele-education applications, GATES would improve basic medical care and education on a global scale.
The goal of the GATES project was to reduce inequalities in health and education within countries and between countries by using telecommunications technology.
The unique aspects of the GATES system were that it took a global approach and it had the dual objective of combining health care and education.
The dual approach was justified by the fact that the highest medical and educational needs generally appeared in the same areas.
Furthermore, the basic communications requirements for health care and educational services were very similar.
Students working on that project were especially concerned with minimizing costs and keeping the infrastructure as simple as possible.
They recognized that the largest problems were economic and political.
An efficient management structure was proposed.
Membership would be open to any country, but services would be available to anyone, regardless of membership.
GATES would not only be used for health and education services, but also for environmental and disaster management applications.
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies that would result in the development of telehealth, distance education systems and further networks where they were needed.
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the gross knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world.
Regulatory, legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be met.
Those issues should not be permitted to inhibit the development of essential worldwide satellite services that were feasible.
Presentations on remote sensing focused on the opportunities for using satellite data for environmental monitoring.
It was stated that developing countries would be able to utilize new developments in remote sensing systems to gain access to significantly greater quantities of valuable data.
Presentations highlighted applications in areas such as forestry, geology and mineral resources, cartography and other fields.
It was emphasized that compared with conventional ground surveys, satellite observations provided less detail but much greater economy, particularly when continuous and repetitive monitoring was required.
Although the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite system of ESA was not specifically planned to meet the needs of developing countries, its data played a vital role, in particular in the fields of environmental monitoring, food production and climate change.
In that context it was emphasized that national aid agencies should substantially increase the use of satellite data in projects funded by them.
They required, however, greater awareness of the potential of space technology for sustainable development.
Aid for food production and preservation of the environment was important not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because it benefits all the donors by cost savings and improved effectiveness in managing emergencies; it also contributed to world political stability.
Space agencies benefited from involvement in aid projects in fields such as education by generating increased public and political interest and by demonstrating their usefulness in converting general policy statements into technical implementation.
The Workshop identified several areas where cooperation could be improved, such as an assessment of user requirements of the developing countries, accessibility of satellite data and information services at reasonable cost, promotion of well-designed pilot projects to assure transition to ongoing operational status, increased on-site education and training, provision of infrastructures for satellite data acquisition and better use of existing user interfaces.
It was agreed that the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) would be the appropriate forum in which to discuss those issues.
MERCURE, a satellite-based communications capability donated to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by member States of ESA, was discussed during the Workshop.
Six European countries had provided the space segment and 16 antennas with related hardware and software.
It would provide UNEP with two different networks: subnet A, the backbone, using 7.3 m antennas providing 384 kilobytes per second (kb/s); and subnet B, for remote areas using 2.4 m antennas providing 64 kb/s.
UNEP currently transmitted about 6 million pages of data to approximately 3,000 users.
Telecommunications costs had quadrupled over the past few years to the current level of US$ 4 million annually.
The service based on MERCURE would be much more effective, and the cost to UNEP would be only US$ 6 million over a period of four years.
The backbone system would be based on 64 channels, each of which would have a capacity of 384 kb/s.
Two INTELSAT satellites - one over the Atlantic Ocean and the other over the Indian Ocean - would be used.
The MERCURE system would also provide much wider access to the Internet in Africa, and facilitate much more efficient dissemination of documents, environmental data, images and messages, resulting in substantial savings in telecommunications costs.
The Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES) project was sponsored by the Joint Research Centre of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA.
Its main objectives were the development of techniques for a global tropical forest inventory using data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) of the United States of America as well as from the ERS-1 satellite; the development of techniques for the detection and monitoring of active deforestation areas and measuring deforestation rates in critical areas; and the development of a comprehensive Tropical Forest Information System to support the modelling of tropical deforestation dynamics.
The baseline assessment of tropical forest cover using AVHRR had been completed.
Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over 18 selected areas had been examined with a view to investigating the feasibility of vegetation mapping with ERS-1.
In the future, research methodologies would be tested for monitoring deforestation, and other data sources, such as SPOT and ATSR-2, would be examined.
In 1992, the Panamazonia Project was proposed with the objective of developing a system for monitoring the tropical forest in Latin America using satellite remote sensing. An experienced technical team was selected from agencies in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Peru and Venezuela.
Visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared images had shown significant environmental damage as a result of deforestation.
It was anticipated that, in the near future, the Panamazonia Project would also provide data on the exploitation of mineral resources.
Considering the magnitude of the losses caused by natural disasters and recognizing the need for a global initiative, the United Nations proclaimed, by resolution 44/236 of 22 December 1989, the 1990s the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
Whereas natural disasters included floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides and certain types of widely spreading infectious diseases, human-induced disasters included explosions, armed conflicts, motor and aircraft accidents, chemical spills etc.
Forest fires could be of either category.
Space technology offered tremendous potential for assisting in disaster response and mitigation.
Telecommunications satellites addressed issues related to mass awareness, warning, education and training, as well as emergency communication in the event of a disaster.
Remote sensing satellites were useful in formulating disaster mitigation measures and in monitoring, and could assist in risk analyses by promoting understanding of the processes that led to natural disasters.
A national risk assessment system was evolving in India to minimize the harmful effects of hazardous events.
That was a national mission, integrating space applications along with other relevant information for disaster warning, disaster mitigation and efficient management of hazardous events.
Unfortunately, only a few countries had the means to operationally utilize space technology for hazard management.
Increasing access to space technology for such uses could be promoted through appropriate international coordination and cooperation.
Fire was the most common natural cause of forest destruction in Canada.
Several projects were in progress to monitor the extent of such damage.
The most advanced forest management information systems were those currently being used to enhance the effectiveness of fire-suppression activities.
Many of those systems made use of satellite remote-sensing data to categorize the fuel type, which was an important factor in determining the risk that a fire would spread.
Combining the fuel type with other parameters enabled fire-suppression authorities to combat forest fires more effectively, thereby dramatically reducing annual losses and achieving significant savings in fire-suppression costs.
Several projects using remote sensing in North America were related to monitoring forest damage caused by forest fires and insect infestations.
Decision support systems were being developed to provide risk assessment and management planning to minimize losses caused by insects.
In many such projects, remote sensing was used as a tool to acquire information related to damage caused by insects.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to perform spatial analyses and to produce risk maps in all of those projects.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The importance of merging space technology with other conventional techniques was stressed throughout the Workshop.
The space sector should therefore not be considered in isolation.
Space technology in developing countries should be related to use by the public sector, namely for telecommunications, remote sensing, meteorology and navigation.
Space science should continue to play a vital role, as even a modest investment in that area could pay big dividends.
Space science was well recognized as a valuable contributor to the advancement of technology, particularly in the area of data processing.
Competence in space science contributed to competence in areas far beyond the specific field of research undertaken.
It was agreed that the Workshop would help to increase awareness of the status and possibilities of applications of space technology in developing countries.
However, one impediment to the introduction of space technology in developing countries was the lack of awareness and understanding on the part of political leaders and senior officials, which often resulted in a lack of political will.
To overcome that difficulty, it would be helpful to select a few good people who had been involved in successful programmes as "ambassadors" to developing countries.
Their credibility would probably have a great impact.
It was important to balance space technology with the capabilities and resources of developing countries.
Many aid projects provided expensive technology to developing countries that could not sustain such systems after the initial project was concluded.
Fundamentally, every country must have its own policy to initiate and integrate space projects into its national programmes.
It was recommended that a step-by-step approach be taken to the introduction of space technology.
Although there was already a large market in developing countries for space technology products, and opportunities existed for joint ventures, more consideration should be given to building up the infrastructure required to successfully implement space programmes.
The importance of having staff that were not only trained, but competent and confident in dealing with all aspects of the applications of space technology, was stressed.
Technological advances must be accompanied by similar progress in the level of understanding of users.
However, while national space coordinating bodies were needed at senior levels to set policy, not every country needed a space agency.
In order to facilitate the implementation of space programmes, international cooperation between developed and developing countries, as well as among developing countries themselves, still needed to be improved.
It was repeatedly recommended that the practical use of satellite data with emphasis being placed on developing simple-to-use and low-cost applications should be promoted in developing countries.
Better access to Internet services should be available for developing countries.
Information on health, remote sensing and GIS was especially useful, and every institution interested in such information should have access to it.
There was a need for better standards and a more liberal approach to pricing in the area of commercial telecommunications.
In that context, international organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union, but also the operators of local platform transmitter terminals (PTTs), should be encouraged to be more liberal in their pricing structures.
To achieve a national commitment to provide resources to space technology, a clear cost-benefit analysis for each project should be prepared for decision makers.
Decision makers in developing countries must be convinced that a judicious expenditure of limited resources on space programmes would substantially contribute to social stability and economic growth.
The need was stressed for participants to pass on their experience to their colleagues, and in particular to decision makers in their home countries.
Furthermore, participants should inform their local PTTs and industries of the discussions and results of the Workshop.
One of the future UN/IAF Workshops should focus on the means of overcoming the regulatory, legal, political, financial and educational obstacles to the better exploitation of space technology in developing countries.
The involvement of the private sector in such meetings should be increased.
In particular, the participation of PTTs and medium-sized companies (of 20 to 100 employees), which could provide relatively low-cost technology and services to developing countries, should be encouraged.
The potential of space technology for improving traditional public health-care services was recognized by participants.
Space technology had a vital role to play in enhancing medical services, medical consulta-tions and the monitoring of epidemic disease, particularly in remote and rural areas.
Recent improvements in satellite communications technology and information systems had resulted in a dramatic increase in telehealth programmes and projects worldwide.
Linking remote locations to an urban medical centre provided an opportunity for specialist consultations that might not be possible otherwise.
Thus, telehealth systems could reduce critical delays in the delivery of health care by providing and expanding access to remote areas.
Whereas some telehealth applications required real-time capability (video conferences for telesurgery, telepsychiatry etc.), other applications, such as image and file transfer, consultations or research, could be supported in a store-and-forward mode.
In the future, telehealth using mobile satellite communications systems such as Inmarsat could form an integral part of national or regional emergency planning.
Developing countries should give higher priority to active participation in, and the application of, space technology in the fields of health care and education.
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures.
The direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology was critical in public health education and remote medical instruction.
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies leading to the development of telehealth and distance education systems where needed.
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world.
However, not only technical, but also regulatory, legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be developed. Those issues should not be allowed to inhibit the development of adequate, worldwide satellite services that were already feasible.
The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive, synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring.
Although many developing countries had indigenous experts in space applications, it was nevertheless difficult for them to solve environmental problems on their own.
Outside assistance and expert advice was therefore essential to the successful application of space technology for sustainable development.
A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national, social and economic development programmes.
There were examples of highly qualified individuals in well-equipped remote sensing laboratories who were not contributing to national plans because of the lack of communication with national policy makers and decision makers, who were thus not aware of the benefits that space applications could bring to national efforts to achieve sustainable development.
The pricing and independence of remote sensing data were critical for the integration of remote sensing into national programmes.
Governments and agencies should therefore be encouraged to reduce prices on remote sensing data and to reduce copyright restrictions.
In connection with the joint TREES project of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA, a deforestation monitoring system should be developed, combining low- and high-resolution data and using the Tropical Forest Information System.
Only a few developing countries currently had telecommunications systems capable of coping with disasters.
Furthermore, traditional telecommunications systems were often severely affected by disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes.
Mobile satellite systems should therefore be used.
Voice, fax and data terminals should continue to be positioned at strategic locations so that an uninterruptible source of warning would be available even if the local radio or television infrastructure had been disabled by a disaster.
A network of terminals would be particularly effective if it were connected to an appropriate regional or global database of GIS or of relevant disaster information.
In many developing countries, land mines presented a serious obstacle to social and economic development.
The process of de-mining was very slow, tedious and dangerous.
Thus, it was recommended that satellite remote sensing should be increasingly used in order to help affected developing countries deal with that problem in a more effective manner.
The continuous establishment of training centres would play a vital role in promoting and applying space technology for sustainable development.
It was suggested that remote sensing and GIS training be combined into one national training centre.
It was also recommended that such centres should train staff from different institutions, so as to encourage information sharing, reduce the amount of overlapping, and minimize the capital investment required.Annex

1. A mobile receiving station which is capable of receiving data from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar satellites has been operational at Libreville, Gabon, since late 1994.
The coverage of the station is a roughly circular geographical zone centred on Libreville which extends, to the north-west, as far as eastern Mali, and to the south-west, as far as the western regions of Zambia.
The territories of 23 African countries, of which 17 are francophone, are either wholly or predominantly covered by the Libreville station.
The near-equatorial location of the receiving station and the cloud-penetration characteristics of radar render the station particularly useful to those countries whose exploitation of conventional optical remote sensing data has been severely hampered due to the presence of heavy cloud cover, which often obstructs observation of the ground in equatorial zones.
2. The objective of the training course was to provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to use radar data in a number of application areas that correspond with major regional and national interests, in particular those pertaining to agriculture, forestry, geology, mineral exploration and land use.
Knowledge of radar image interpretation is becoming increasingly important because of the growing number of operational and planned radar satellites (e.g. ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, Radarsat) and the attendant increasing use of spaceborne radar as a tool to monitor tropical regions.
The training course was co-sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United Nations. It was held at Libreville, Gabon, from 15 to 19 May 1995, for the benefit of francophone countries within the region served by the receiving station.
3. The present report includes descriptions of the organization of the training course and enumerates the recommendations for follow-up action.
In particular, it details plans for a number of projects of regional interest and scope which were elaborated by the participants themselves.
The report has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants are expected to report to the relevant authorities in their countries. B. Organization and programme
4. Application forms and information on the training course were sent out in September 1994 by the United Nations to offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for onward transmission to national authorities in 13 countries within the region: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Togo and Zaire.
5. The training course was attended by 25 participants, 12 of whom were from Gabon.
The other 13 participants were from the following nine countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, Niger and Senegal.
Other participants were from the Office for Outer Space Affairs, ESA, German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Scot Conseil and Groupement pour le d√©veloppement de la t√©l√©d√©tection a√©rospatiale (GDTA).
6. Funds for the participation of the 13 international participants from developing countries were obtained from budgetary allocations of the United Nations and from financial support received from ESA.
The Government of Gabon provided secretarial support and local transportation for the benefit of the participants.
7. A high official of the Ministry of Water, Forests, Post and Telecommunications, and the Environment, Mr. O. Mboulamatari, gave an address on behalf of the Government of Gabon at the opening ceremony.
Addresses were also given by the representatives of ESA, UNDP and the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The Minister of Water, Forests, Post and Telecommunications, and the Environment received the representatives of ESA and the Office for Outer Space Affairs together with nine high-ranking ministry officials.
This ceremony as well as those of the opening and closing of the training course were covered by the local radio, newspaper and television media.
8. The programme of the training course (see annex I) was developed by the United Nations in consultation with ESA.
The course was conducted through a series of lectures and practical exercises which emphasized the use of ERS data but did not exclude discussion of other satellite radar systems.
On the last day of the training course, formal presentations were made followed by discussion of regional projects prepared by the participants in working groups for which access to and the use of ERS data would be a key element.
One of the highlights of the course was a visit to the Libreville ERS receiving station, which was conducted by Mr. K. Reiniger of DLR, and followed a visit to the Ariane tracking station, conducted by Mr. Audegean of the Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES), the French space agency.
9. The principal instructor of the training course was Mr. M. Fea of ESA.
Supplementary technical presentations were made by the representatives of DLR, GDTA, Scot Conseil and the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
A concise summary of the major topics presented during the training course is given in section I, below.
This is followed, in section II, by a presentation of the recommendations of a number of working groups.
In addition to informal comments communicated to the United Nations during the course, a formal course-evaluation session (see section III, below) was held on the last day of the training course to gather input which would be useful for identifying future activities which would respond best to the needs of countries in the region. The proposed plan of follow-up activities is presented in section IV, below.
I. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS A. European remote sensing satellites and instrumentation 10. There are currently two ERS satellites in operation, ERS-1 and ERS-2, launched in July 1991 and April 1995, respectively.
Both satellites are equipped with microwave (radar) instrumentation which penetrates cloud cover and darkness and provides information 24 hours a day.
The satellites measure many parameters which are not currently measured by existing satellite systems.
ERS data, when used either alone or in conjunction with other data, are particularly useful in the following applications: oceanography, glaciology, meteorology, forestry, soils, agriculture and hydrology.
11. The principal instruments on board the satellites include (a) an Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which comprises a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and a wind scatterometer; (b) a radar altimeter (RA); (c) an along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR), which comprises an infrared radiometer (IRR) and a microwave sounder (MWS); (d) precise range and range-rate equipment (PRARE), presently functioning only on ERS-2; and (e) a laser retroreflector.
In addition, the ERS-2 mission contains the global ozone monitoring experiment (GOME), which provides atmospheric chemistry measurements (ozone and other gases) and an improved ATSR instrument that includes three visible channels.
It also allows the derivation of digital elevation models (topographic maps).
In wave mode, SAR is used to measure ocean-wave spectra and wave direction, while in scatterometer mode, AMI is used to measure wind direction and speed at the ocean surface.
The radar altimeter permits the measurement of wind speed, wave height, sea-surface elevation, ice profile, land and ice topography, and sea-ice boundaries.
ATSR is used to measure the surface temperatures of the sea, land and clouds.
It is also used in the measurement of cloud cover, aerosols, vegetation, atmospheric water vapour and liquid water content.
PRARE on ERS-2 provides precise corrections of altimeter measurements.
The laser retroreflector is a passive optical device used as a target by ground-based laser ranging stations in order to determine the accurate position of the satellite.1
13. The participants from countries in the equatorial regions of Africa showed the greatest interest in the terrestrial applications of images obtained using the SAR instrument.
In image mode, the SAR instrument acquires strips of images 100 km in width to the right of the satellite track.
The ground spatial resolution is 25 m.
It is different from optical sensors in that it operates within a frequency range, designated C-band, at a nominal frequency of 5.3 GHz with vertical transmission and vertical reception of radar signals (VV polarization) and a look angle of 23 degrees.
14. ERS-1 has a sun-synchronous, near polar, quasi-circular orbit with a mean altitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees.
It has a 35-day repeat cycle with a re-visit period of 16-18 days. Its orbital cycle is 101 minutes.
The data transmission rate for the SAR instrument is 105 megabits per second. On-board recorders cannot be used to store SAR data, which can only be transmitted to receiving stations when these are in sight.
ERS-2 is similar in operation to ERS-1.
Following the commissioning phase of ERS-2, the two satellites will operate in tandem with ERS-2 following ERS-1 at a separation time of 1 day.
This time of separation is subject to change.
It is planned to maintain the ground track between the two satellites at 50-600 metres in order to improve opportunities for interferometric applications.
B. Interpretation of European remote sensing satellite data for applications of national interest
15. Radar remote sensing from space has a number of advantages over airborne radar.
Unlike spaceborne radar where the incidence angle changes very little, in airborne applications there is a large change in incidence angle across the image swath, which causes difficulty in distinguishing whether changes in backscatter are related simply to changes in incident angle or to changes in the geometry and/or the materials themselves.
The look angle for the ERS satellites is 23 degrees (the local angle of incidence on the ground is slightly greater than this due to the curvature of Earth).
At this look angle, radar backscatter is strongly influenced by topographic slope.
Hence, surface features which give rise to changes in topography, e.g. geological lineaments which may indicate mineral occurrences, are more easily interpretable using spaceborne imagery.
Nevertheless, effects such as radar shadowing, layover (relief displacement) and foreshortening can complicate the visual interpretation of imagery of areas of rugged terrain.
16. Radar backscatter is dominated by the geometrical and electrical properties of surface materials, a fact which must be taken into account during the interpretation of radar images.
Materials of varying roughness - a factor which is dependent on the particular radar wavelength being used - reflect the radar signal in different ways.
Rough surfaces cause diffuse reflections in all directions and a significant portion of the signal is returned to the sensor.
Smooth surfaces result in specular reflection with practically all of the signal being reflected away from the sensor.
Very high return signals occur when adjacent smooth surfaces form right angles, which cause a double reflection and hence high return signals to the sensor.
This occurs naturally, for example, in the case of tree trunks standing in swampy, water-logged areas.
17. The electrical character of surface material, as indicated by its complex dielectric constant, is also critical in the interpretation of radar images.
Radar reflectivity is considerably increased in the presence of water, which has a dielectric constant greater than 10 times that of dry materials.
This characteristic makes radar imagery especially useful in differentiating areas of dry from moist soil and in the identification of vegetated zones often characterized by high humidity that would give rise to a strong radar response.
18. Radar reflection from vegetation is also influenced by the type of polarization.
In general, like-polarized signals, such as the VV polarization of the ERS instruments, are better at penetrating vegetation than crossed-polarized signals.
While ERS and Radarsat satellites operate in the C-band, JERS-1 operates in the longer L-band.
Radar penetration of vegetation - forests and agricultural crops - is influenced by the wavelength of the signal.
Shorter wavelengths may be scattered by the tree canopy, however, longer wavelengths tend to penetrate it and be reflected by the underlying soil.
The use of radar images of multiple wavelengths from multiple space platforms (e.g. ERS/Radarsat, JERS-1, Shuttle Imaging Radar/Seasat) can therefore provide more information and allow for better differentiation in certain land-cover and forestry studies.
19. In general, through a knowledge of the interdependence of the factors which have a major influence on radar response (e.g. incidence angle, moisture content, surface roughness, geometry and slope orientation), ERS imagery corresponding to a single date can be interpreted for a variety of terrestrial applications.
These applications can be placed in one or more of the following categories: (a) feature identification, (b) determination of the spatial extent of a feature of interest, (c) detection of change, e.g. deforestation, and (d) quantitative determination of biogeophysical parameters, e.g. soil-water content.
20. The interpretation of ERS imagery can be facilitated by digital enhancement procedures (filtering, colour coding etc.) that serve to highlight particular features of interest.
Radar images are often characterized by speckle, which appears as a salt-and-pepper pattern.
This effect is due to random constructive and destructive interference of radar waves that results in a random pattern of light and dark areas on the imagery.
Speckle can be reduced by application of appropriate digital filtering or multi-look processing procedures.
The reduction of speckle is a necessary precursor to computer classification of radar imagery as well as to visual interpretation since it tends to mask fine details.
21. In addition to the various possible enhancement of imagery from a single date, images from multiple dates can be exploited to yield new information, e.g. change detection.
A single image from a given date may not be sufficient to differentiate several different crop types.
However, two or more images acquired at different times during the growing season may allow differentiation of crop cover.
Soils whose moisture content evolves differently during the year may be differentiated using multiple-date images.
22. In instances when both optical and radar satellite images are available, the two can be merged to exploit the complementarity that exists between the two data sets.
Techniques for merging optical and radar data, such as the construction of colour composites and intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transformations, can be employed to emphasize or de-emphasize surface features while retaining information from both data sets.
Such merging operations must overcome difficulties of image co-registration, i.e. the accurate matching of common features appearing on both images when these are superimposed.
For this reason, in areas of appreciable relief, a digital elevation model is used during registration to correct for relief displacements.
23. The technique of interferometry, by which the "phase" difference associated with a given pixel from two SAR images is analysed, allows for precise determination of elevation.
The preparation of precise topographic maps from SAR images is therefore possible.
Differential interferometry also allows for the monitoring of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
C. Data access and processing
24. Information on the availability of processed ERS data collected at the Libreville station and archived at the DLR facility at Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, is readily available using a software program called DESC developed by ESA.
The program allows interactive searching of a database to find and identify image frames which correspond to a geographic region of interest.
This database is periodically updated by ESA and distributed to registered users.
Updates can also be obtained electronically via the Internet.
25. The high volumes of data associated with digital processing (e.g. geocoding, enhancements) of ERS images necessitate access to fairly powerful PC-based systems with software capable of processing and displaying 16-bit ERS images.
In addition, the production of high-quality prints of the digitally enhanced images would require access to large-format printers.
The high costs inherent in the acquisition of these items of equipment may put digital image processing of radar data out of the reach of some African institutions.
However, the preparation of large-scale photographic prints of ERS images may be more cost-effective if it is initially left to service companies in Europe and elsewhere.
II. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUPS
26. Based on the potential usefulness of satellite radar data as presented during the training course, the participants identified a number of projects which could benefit from the radar data collected at the Libreville receiving station.
Some of these projects are already ongoing and involve the institutions to which the participants are attached.
The remainder are newly conceived project proposals.
The projects listed represent the output of three working groups, corresponding to each of the three application themes.
These groups were constituted specifically to discuss national and regional development issues and to identify specific target activities which can benefit from the exploitation of ERS data.
The working groups also made a number of recommendations which aim at enhancing the use of ERS data by countries within the region.
These recommendations are aimed at all relevant entitites, including the United Nations, Governments and space agencies, whose timely interventions may serve to improve the present situation.
The recommendations have been synthesized and are as follows:
(a) Participants should have access to more in-depth training on detailed radar image interpretation.
In general, while a one-week training course is good for a general introduction to radar, a course lasting approximately three weeks is needed to develop the technical confidence needed to use the data on an operational basis;
(b) A follow-up training course should be organized to share operational experiences on applications of ERS data and to consolidate technical concepts introduced during the present course;
(c) Countries within the region should have access to the ERS images collected by the Libreville station;
(d) Cooperation between South-South and North-South in matters related to ERS data should be promoted and strengthened;
(e) Training should be given in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and the integration of radar and other remote sensing data in GIS systems;
(f) Countries within the region should have access to technical assistance in matters related to the exploitation of radar images within an operational setting;
(g) National and regional institutions should be invited to participate in the demonstration studies of ERS data from the Libreville station.
27. There is as yet limited experience on the use of satellite radar images in tropical regions.
For this reason, the operational usefulness of ERS data in African countries needs to be demonstrated.
Necessarily, such a demonstration should involve African institutions and professionals who are knowledgeable of ground conditions and can attest to the usefulness and applicability of the radar data under their local conditions.
28. As illustrated in annex II, the problems which have already been encountered in existing projects or those that are envisaged in proposed ones concern the presence of heavy cloud cover on conventional optical satellite images.
Thus, a principal need is adequate access to the radar images which have been collected by the ERS station at Libreville.
29. Only a few of the participants came from institutions which possessed the computer hardware and software needed for digital processing of voluminous ERS radar.
Consequently, there was considerable discussion on ways in which to gain immediate access to the paper prints of digital images which would be suitably enhanced so as to highlight particular features of thematic interest, e.g. geology, land use and land cover, agriculture and forestry.
In that regard, it appears that private companies in Europe which already have experience in the digital processing and enhancement of ERS data as well as in their photographic reproduction may be used to create large-scale photomaps.
Such maps could easily be used at the present time by all of the countries represented at the training course.
An eventual progression towards the digital processing and printing of ERS images is, however, highly desirable, particularly by participants from those national institutions which already have several years of experience in digital image analysis.
III. COURSE EVALUATION
30. Suggestions abstracted from the evaluation sheets filled in by the participants are as follows:
(a) Access to more detailed training (lasting at least 10 days) is highly desirable, in association with national or international entities experienced in the specific area of application;
(b) The course should devote more time for practical exercises;
(c) French documentation on ERS radar applications in all themes of interest should be made available;
(d) A wider distribution of information concerning training courses should be made available well ahead of their scheduling;
(e) Consideration should be given in order to avoid problems of distribution, to making direct contact with the national agencies or contact persons concerned, perhaps using electronic means, in addition to the normal official channels;
(f) The United Nations and ESA should maintain contact with the participants after the course in order to keep them abreast of developments in satellite radar technology;
(g) A follow-up meeting should be held in one or two years;
(h) Access should be given to training on digital analysis of radar images.
IV. PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP PLAN OF ACTION
31. The Office for Outer Space Affairs together with ESA propose to respond to the recommendations of the working groups and the various comments made during the course evaluation by undertaking the following activities:
(a) A number of projects will be selected from among those already proposed by the participants for possible assistance.
In this regard, more detailed proposals than those elaborated during the course will be solicited from the participants in order to evaluate properly the relative merits of the various proposals and to facilitate the selection, on a competitive basis, of a number of projects worthy of support;
(b) Subsequently, arrangements will be made for supporting the selected projects within the framework of an assistance programme currently being developed jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA.
As envisaged, this programme will provide limited support (e.g. training, access to satellite images and selected items of equipment needed for image interpretation) for ongoing activities;
(c) Expansion of the distribution of information related to the scheduling of the various training programmes and workshops organized each year by the Office for Outer Space Affairs will be made progressively to include selected national institutions whose activities may benefit from the application of space technology.
Priority will be given to information distribution by electronic means (e.g. e-mail);
Specifically, the names of all course participants has been put on the ESA mailing list to receive the Earth Observation Quarterly.
In addition, ESA has mailed copies of the DESC software program to all participants.);
(e) A follow-up advanced training course/seminar will be held involving participants who will have used ERS data from the Libreville station in an operational setting.

A. Astronomy and space physics
During Fiscal Year 1994 (FY 1994), space scientists continued to add to the fund of information about the universe gathered not only through instruments located on Earth, but also from those on satellites above the distorting medium of the home planet's atmosphere.
For example, scientists working on the Hubble Space Telescope team made a number of important discoveries during FY 1994, including images of an exploding star (Nova Cygni 1992).
Many of these findings preceded the highly successful servicing mission in December 1993 when astronauts on STS-61 replaced several faulty parts and installed a sophisticated package of corrective optics to compensate for the spherical aberration in HST's primary mirror.
Coin-sized mirrors on the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacements units have since served as "contact lenses" for HST.
While the telescope has always had a view of the sky unobstructed by haze from the Earth, scientists since have been able to accomplish all the astronomical goals initially planned for the most sophisticated observatory ever built.
In the process, HST's first servicing mission proved the capability of NASA's highly trained astronauts to work productively in space.
As one fruit of their efforts, an astronomer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), heading an international team, used HST's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in May 1994 to obtain valuable new images of Supernova 1994I, discovered by amateur astronomers in April 1994 in the inner regions of the "Whirlpool Galaxy," M51.
HST has the unique capability of imaging and measuring the spectra of distant supernovae in ultraviolet light.
As the M51 supernova ages, Hubble will "see" more deeply into the interior of the exploding star.
This will permit astronomers to probe the chemical composition of the debris and learn more about the type of star that exploded.
The team of scientists hope thereby to learn which stars explode as supernovae, what chemical elements are ejected, and how to use these bright events as yardsticks for measuring the size of the universe.
In June 1994, two scientists using the HST discovered disks of protoplanetary dust around stars in the Orion Nebula region of the Milky Way galaxy.
This revelation indicates that the formation of planets may be relatively common both in the Milky Way and in other parts of the universe.
The newly found disks contain many of the same basic chemicals that compose the planets in our solar system.
Because planets are the only heavenly bodies that can support life as we know it, the existence of planets around other stars would raise the likelihood of life in other parts of the universe.
Then in July 1994, an international team of astronomers using HST's Faint Object Camera confirmed that helium is widespread throughout the early universe, a key hypothesis of the Big Bang theory.
The discovery of helium in the constellation of Cetus, which is 13 billion light years away, gives scientists valuable information about conditions at the time of the universe's initial evolution.
Additionally, this finding lends further weight to the scientists' conception of chemical evolution in the universe; scientists believe that hydrogen and helium evolved within three minutes after the Big Bang, while heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon came later.
In other developments, scientists analyzing data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), which was launched in April 1991, found new evidence that gamma-ray bursts extend into the far reaches of the universe and thus bear an imprint of the universe's expansion.
These huge explosions come from all directions, suggesting a cosmological cause; until this discovery it was believed that the bursts were limited to within the Milky Way galaxy.
Because the bursts come from so far away, they demonstrate "time dilation," an effect created when time seems to be running more slowly at the bursts' source than at their destination, since the universe itself is thought to be expanding.
Relatedly, the CGRO's Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) provided the first detailed all sky map of highly energetic gamma ray objects, pointing out several different types of gamma ray sources.
Scientists believe, for example, that the interactions of cosmic ray particles with gas between the stars produce diffuse gamma ray emissions from our Milky Way galaxy.
Within this band are gamma ray pulsars and other unidentified sources of gamma rays.
Astronomers analyzing EGRET's data have also identified what they think are massive black holes in the middle of distant galaxies that are sending gamma rays in Earth's direction.
Similarly, the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), launched in June 1992, produced the first all-sky map in four extreme ultraviolet wavelength bands.
This survey has identified large numbers of very hot stars such as white dwarfs and active corona stars.
For purposes of comparison, scientists also surveyed a companion area along half the ecliptic plane on which Earth travels around the Sun.
Space physicists using the Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX), launched in June 1992, discovered a radiation belt of trapped anomalous cosmic rays in the magnetosphere.
They have determined the chemical composition and electrical charge of these rays in the region beyond the Earth's upper atmosphere where the planet's magnetic field affects charged particles.
In addition, these scientists have learned a lot about the effects of electrons in the upper atmosphere.
SAMPEX's mission is to monitor energetic electrons and atomic ions from the Sun and from interplanetary, interstellar, and magnetospheric space.
Space physicists also achieved breakthroughs in computer modeling.
In particular, complex numerical modeling has led to a detailed conception of the Earth's magnetosphere.
As a result, scientists are now able to predict "space weather" caused by solar-terrestrial interactions.
Investigators using computer simulations have also gained a refined understanding of the heliopause, the boundary of the solar system where the solar wind's outward flow is balanced by the pressure of the interstellar medium.
SPARTAN 201-2, a small satellite deployed and then retrieved several days later by the Space Shuttle Discovery in September 1994, examined the Sun's hot outer atmosphere, or extended corona, and the solar wind, the flow of charged ions from the Sun.
On its second of four planned missions aboard the Shuttle, SPARTAN contained two instruments--the NASA-designed White Light Coronograph to measure the density and distribution of the electrons in the coronal holes and polar plumes of the Sun and the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer, designed by the SAO.
Together, the two instruments can determine the velocity of the solar wind as it accelerates out of the Sun so that scientists can grasp exactly how and when the Sun creates this wind as well as what the shape and spectroscopy of the solar corona may be.
The measurements made by SPARTAN 201 will be used in conjunction with those from the Ulysses spacecraft, which was launched in October 1990 and which detected the solar wind from the south polar corona as SPARTAN observed the source region of that wind as well as other portions of the Sun's corona.
Data from SPARTAN 201 will also calibrate measurements to be made by the European Space Agency (ESA)-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, scheduled for launch in 1995.
Scientists hope to derive practical information from these missions about exactly how the solar wind produces magnetic storms near the Earth that can disrupt communication systems and trigger power outages, resulting in losses estimated at $100 million each year worldwide.
Ulysses, meanwhile, became the first spacecraft to fly over a polar region of the Sun when, in June 1994, it began its primary mission to observe the solar wind at high-solar latitudes.
Built by ESA and equipped with both European and United States instruments, Ulysses will take direct measurements of many complex solar phenomena that cannot be observed remotely.
Scientists are eager to learn more about the Sun's polar magnetic fields, which reverse polarity every 11 years in conjunction with the solar cycle; they play an important role in the Sun's corona and solar wind.
The ionic composition of the solar wind, measured by Ulysses, indicates that its source in the coronal gas measures just over a million degrees Centigrade.
This is not hot enough to make the wind go as fast as it does, indicating that some unknown electromagnetic process near the Sun is responsible for accelerating the solar wind.
In a separate development, researchers from the University of Alaska in Fairbanks recorded spectacular upper atmospheric flashes occurring above electrical thunderstorms.
For many years, pilots have noticed these bright blue and red flashes that last only a few thousandths of a second.
Using special low-light-level cameras mounted on two small aircraft, scientists recently captured these flashes on video for the first time.
They extended upward as high as 100 kilometers and some even reached through the Earth's ozone layer to the ionosphere.
After coordinating their measurements with scientists at other institutions, the researchers came to suspect that the flashes are a form of electrical discharge.
The scientists plan further study to understand the origin of the flashes and their potential impact on aircraft safety.
More broadly, this phenomenon links the weather in the Earth's lower atmosphere to upper atmospheric layers that form our planet's border to space.
In other weather-related space science, NASA conducted a series of sounding rocket flights during FY 1994 to examine the Alaskan auroras.
Space physicists are interested in these colorful phenomena known as "Northern Lights" because they are caused by variations in the solar wind's interaction with the Earth's magnetic field.
Equipped with sophisticated payloads, sounding rockets flew directly through the auroras, allowing scientists to take direct measurements of the ions' energy levels.
Researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how these particles are accelerated and energized.
This campaign of eight rocket flights formed a significant part of the Space Physics Division's 41 rocket flights this fiscal year.
Because of their extreme luminosity at maximum light, Type Ia supernovae have proved themselves to be valuable in measuring both the local rate of expansion of the universe and the rate of change of that expansion.
Recent work by Mark Phillips of the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory in Chile has shown that there is a significant spread in the intrinsic radiated energy in visible light of this key subtype of supernova.
That spread can introduce a bias in samples of distant supernovae, leading to erroneous estimates of universal deceleration.
Phillips and his collaborators found a good correlation between the rate of decline with time of the luminous output of supernovae and their peak brightness.
The strength of the spectral features can be used to increase the accuracy of the estimate of each supernova's intrinsic brightness and therefore, its distance.
The use of this technique now places supernovae among the most accurate of the standard candles, suitable for use as distant probes measuring features of the early universe.
A series of systematic observations by astronomers has long suggested the existence of a "Great Attractor," a concentration of mass that causes a bulk flow of galaxies toward it.
Scientists discovered this large-scale flow by comparing the motion of the local group with respect to clusters versus the motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background, which is assumed to be a "stationary" reference.
The strength of such large-scale flows can distinguish among models that explain the formulation of galaxies and clusters in the early universe.
More recently, astronomers have begun to examine large volumes of space to search for structure and flows on even larger scales.
Work by Todd R. Lauer (National Optical Astronomy Observatories) and Marc Postman (Space Telescope Science Institute), using the Kitt Peak National Observatory's 4- and 2.1-meter telescopes in Arizona and the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory's 1.5-meter telescope in Chile, suggests that bulk flows can be identified over scales as large as some 600 million light-years, almost three times larger than those found in previous investigations.
They used the brightest galaxies to measure the distances and velocities of 119 clusters, creating the cluster reference frame.
The motion of the local group of galaxies derived with respect to these galaxy clusters was significantly different from the one derived with respect to the cosmic microwave background.
The most straightforward interpretation of this result is that all the galaxies in the volume of space defined by these clusters are streaming with a velocity of nearly 700 kilometers per second and that any "attractor" has to lie beyond the boundaries of the original search.
A structure this large cannot be explained by any current theoretical model and opens fruitful new directions for understanding the scale of the largest structures in the universe.
The application of seismology to the study of the solar interior has advanced almost solely by the prediction and measurement of the Sun's frequencies of oscillation.
Thomas L. Duvall (Goddard Space Flight Center), Stuart Jeffries (Bartol), Jack W. Harvey (National Solar Observatory, Tucson) and Martin A. Pomerantz (Bartol) have shown that it is also possible to obtain direct measurements of the travel times and distances of individual acoustic (sound-like) waves, which is the predominant approach in terrestrial seismology.
The basic concept is simple: At the surface, a wave propagating upward from the interior is reflected back downwards by the steep change in the density of the gas at the Sun's surface.
As the wave travels into the interior, its path is curved back toward the surface by refraction, caused by the strong increase of temperature with increasing depth.
If the upward wave causes a brightening in the area of the Sun's surface, then there will be a correlated brightening where the wave resurfaces at a later time.
By measuring this time difference as a function of the distance of separation of two surface locations, it is possible to develop a plot of the travel time versus the distance of separation, a plot familiar from terrestrial seismology.
The initial work showed that acoustic waves with frequencies of oscillation greater than a critical value predicted from the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere are not significantly reflected by the atmosphere, with less than 2-percent reflection coefficient.
This approach opens the way for seismic studies of local solar phenomena, such as inhomogeneities beneath the Sun's surface near sunspots.
It should also help refine models of the gas velocities below the Sun's surface.
Drs. Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse of Princeton University won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico of the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 and their subsequent monitoring and analysis of this object.
Their work demonstrated convincingly the appropriateness of general relativity as a theory of gravitation under extreme conditions and indirectly confirmed the existence of the gravitational radiation Albert Einstein had predicted.
In more recent use of the Arecibo radio telescope, continued timing of the millisecond binary pulsar PSR B1257+12 by its discoverer, Alexander Wolszczan of Pennsylvania State University, has greatly strengthened the case for the previously-announced pair of planets that orbit this object; the observations have begun to show the expected effects that the planets' mutual gravity has on their orbital motion.
The observations have also revealed the presence of a third planetary body, with a mass only 1.5 percent that of the Earth, that orbits the central neutron stars at a distance of only 0.2 astronomical units.
Observations of gas clouds associated with the high-redshift quasar PC 1643+4631A using the 42 and 12-meter radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO--Kitt Peak, Arizona) have revealed the presence of carbon monoxide emission.
Clouds such as this have been identified previously with the progenitors of current galaxies.
The red shift of the molecular spectral lines indicates that they were emitted when the universe was about one-fifth of its present age.
The observations by David T. Frayer, NRAO associate director Robert L. Brown, and NRAO director Paul A. Venden Bout are striking in that they indicate a molecular mass of 4.5 trillion solar masses.
This equals the stellar mass of a large galaxy, but here the material apparently lies in an extended, gaseous, prestellar state.
Also noteworthy are the substantial quantities of carbon and oxygen that make up the carbon monoxide molecules; these elements must have themselves been produced in a burst of massive star formation preceding the observed protogalactic state.
The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA) made wintertime astrophysical observations from NSF's observatory at South Pole for the first time during the austral winter of 1994.
CARA's South Pole Infrared EXplorer (SPIREX) telescope was able, because of its unique location, to image more of the impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter than any other instrument.
Also, site measurements by SPIREX confirmed that the sky at South Pole is darker by a factor of at least three than any other site previously surveyed.
Another of CARA's experiments is on the Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy; at the end of the fiscal year, it consisted of a suite of two telescopes designated PYTHON and VIPER.
PYTHON has made measurements at South Pole during the past two austral summers and has now been operated for the first time during winter.
It has made important confirmation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy first measured by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in 1989, and it has begun to make a finer scale map of the CMB than is possible with the smaller antennas of COBE.
The quiet atmospheric conditions at South Pole have allowed PYTHON to make measurements of unprecedented sensitivity.
Using new data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA, launched by Japan in February 1993) about two supernova remnants (designated E0519-69.0 and N103B) in the Large Megallanic Cloud, a binational team of astronomers led by SAO's John P. Hughes discovered significant amounts of iron, calcium, and other newly synthesized elements.
ASCA gives astronomers a better tool for direct observation of the emissions from many atoms, including oxygen, silicon, calcium, and iron, in the ejected gas of supernovae, lasting for many hundreds of years after the explosion that created the supernova.
Scientists believe that the explosions which created the remnants occurred somewhere between 500 and 1,500 years ago. The obvious presence of iron emissions coupled with the lack of strong oxygen emission suggests that these remnants belong to the select group of supernova explosions that produced the bulk of the iron in the universe, according to Hughes.
Further study of the new data should help astronomers refine current models of supernova explosions and "because of the ubiquitous presence of iron throughout the universe," Hughes expected the results to have a large influence on astronomy in general.
Two other SAO scientists, Dong-Woo Kim and Giuseppina Fabbiano, discovered a huge, hot, gaseous halo surrounding a distant galaxy, perhaps providing evidence for the presence of both dark matter and so-called cooling flows.
This, in turn, may shed new light on whether the universe is open or closed.
The two astronomers used the joint German-United States-U.K. x-ray satellite Roentgen Satellite (ROSAT), launched in June 1990, to observe an x-ray-bright elliptical galaxy, NGC 507, some 300 million light years from Earth.
Measuring the temperatures of x-ray-emitting hot gas, they observed a steady decrease of heat toward the galaxy's center.
They believe this fall in temperatures may result from cooling flows in the central region.
Also, uncertainty in measurements of the mass of NGC 507 suggest that a large amount of dark matter may be present.
Observations indicate that baryonic matter (mass seen as stars and gas in all wavelengths) makes up some 15 percent of the estimated total mass of the galaxy.
Since current cosmological theory predicts that baryonic mass must be less than 5 percent to "close" the universe, this finding has implications for cosmology.
However, similar measurements of many other systems will be necessary before scientists can determine whether the universe is open or closed.
B. Solar system exploration
Closer to home, scientists were also making new discoveries about our own solar system.
For example, ground observations conducted under the Near Earth Object program detected the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet in 1993 and predicted its impact upon Jupiter in July 1994.
This event marked one of the more spectacular results of a detailed, long-term telescopic survey of the night sky at Palomar Observatory, California, by United States Geological Survey (USGS) geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker and two volunteers, Carolyn S. Shoemaker and David H. Levy.
It was the first totally disrupted (fragmented) comet ever to be observed, and the first to be seen orbiting and impacting a planet.
For the first time, the worldwide scientific community was able to predict and track such a crash.
A total of 21 observable fragments collided with Jupiter over a week-long period.
The impact, observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths, produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth.
During the last few months of the fiscal year, scientists under contract to the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) used their expertise in simulation and modeling of the nuclear effects in the Earth's atmosphere to explain the enhanced radio emission data resulting from measurements in various radio frequency bands from Jupiter's magnetosphere during the impact.
Their findings, in line with a shock acceleration model, suggest a greater effect than had previously been assumed.
As the fiscal year ended, previous calculations were being refined in collaboration with a variety of radio and optical observers and investigators.
In anticipation of the collision of the comet with Jupiter, the Divisions of Astronomical Sciences and Atmospheric Sciences within the NSF and the Solar System Exploration Division of NASA sponsored a special program to support observational and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of energy deposition into different regions of Jupiter's atmosphere.
Theoretical models account for the amount and velocity of material ejected during the collisions as well as the chemical reactions that occur as a result of the interaction of this material with the neutral and ionized components of Jupiter's atmosphere.
The impact is expected to have generated dust that, on being charged through exposure to the plasma environment, will form new dust rings around the planet.
Data obtained from a variety of instruments strategically deployed to observe the effects of the impacts will test the theoretical predictions.
NASA scientists also made exciting new strides in lunar studies while working on the Department of Defense (DoD)-sponsored Clementine mission.
This effort, in which lunar research was only one of the goals, was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with the support of NASA, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. Launched on January 25, 1994, the Clementine spacecraft entered lunar orbit on February 19, 1994.
For the next 2 1/2 months, four cameras took 1.8 million images of the surface of the Moon in 11 discreet wavebands with coarse altimetry over most of the lunar surface, resulting in the first comprehensive digital map of that surface.
In addition, NASA scientists are excited to have multispectral surface data covering 11 colors in the visible and infrared spectra.
Instruments such as a laser ranger, a charged particle telescope, advanced thermal imagers, and radio tracking gear also contributed significant new information about the Moon's topography, surface composition, and charged particle environment.
For example, the lidar system compiled a complete map of lunar elevations, discovering a 12-kilometer-deep impact crater at the lunar south pole in the process.
An in-flight contrived experiment to use the communications transmitter for active, bistatic measurements produced supportive but not conclusive evidence for the existence of ice in the permanent shadows of craters near the lunar poles.
NASA planned to sponsor a series of multiyear grants to scientists to examine Clementine's lunar data in expectation of discovering new insights about the Moon's formation.
The USGS has begun processing the Clementine data to produce global digital maps, as well.
A secondary mission of Clementine, a deep-space encounter with the asteroid 1620 Geographos, could not be completed because of a problem that occurred after completion of the lunar mapping mission.
Galileo, on the other hand, did complete its encounter with the asteroid Ida and in the process made the curious discovery of the first confirmed moon around an asteroid.
This was the 1.5-kilometer-in-diameter satellite, Dactyl.
Although scientists previously believed that natural satellites of asteroids probably existed, they now contend that such moons may be more widespread than previously considered.
As the fiscal year ended researchers were busy examining data about Ida's moon to learn how both bodies were formed.
One possibility is that the moon was formed during the explosion of a larger asteroid of heterogeneous composition that also gave birth to Ida.
Spectral analysis by Galileo's near-infrared mapping spectrometer revealed that Dactyl is composed of different amounts of specific compounds than Ida, indicating that it did not come directly from Ida.
New data gathered by Galileo indicate that Ida's composition is more diverse than previously thought.
By examining the moon's orbital parameters, scientists, including those from NASA and the USGS, can better determine Ida's mass.
Combining this information with prior data on Ida's size will enable scientists to deduce the asteroid's density and composition.
While on its way to Jupiter, Galileo also examined another asteroid, Gaspra, which, like Ida, travels in the main asteroid belt orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.
In other planetary exploration, the Magellan spacecraft, launched in May 1989, determined that Venus is still geologically active.
After completing the mapping of the planet's surface, Magellan began collecting information about its density.
By tracking the spacecraft's precise speed over specific areas of the planet, ground controllers back on Earth calculated the strength of gravity in these locations and thus the subsurface density.
The data indicate that Venusian areas of high gravity correspond to areas of high elevation, in contrast to the situation on Earth, where mountain ranges correspond to gravitational lows.
Relatedly, the USGS successfully completed the first full-resolution global radar mosaic of Venus (1:1,500,000 scale); a series of 170 CD-ROMs containing the same spacecraft data was in production as the fiscal year ended.
Nearly half of the 1:1,500,000-scale geologic base map quadrangles have been completed to support NASA's Venus Geologic Mapping Program.
In addition, the USGS has been involved in planning for unpiloted missions NASA proposes to send to Mars, including Pathfinder (a lander with a small rover projected for 1996-97), at least two orbiters named Mars Global Surveyor, and a series of Mars Surveyor landers.
Geologists from the Survey served on the Pathfinder imaging team and helped plan for a wide range of Pathfinder experiments and geologic observations, including selection of a landing site at the mouth of a large Martian outflow channel.
Survey personnel also helped plan for Surveyor orbiter and lander missions projected to take place between 1998 and 2005.
C. Other space science
NASA made significant strides in microgravity and life sciences research during FY 1994, beginning with the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2) mission in October 1993.
Its payload consisted of 14 experiments that examined physiological responses of humans and rodents to microgravity and their subsequent readaptation to Earth's gravity.
As an extension of the SLS-1 mission in June 1991, research on SLS-2 focused on identifying and further characterizing the changes in physiological systems during and after space flight and on increasing our knowledge about underlying mechanisms so we can minimize or counteract changes adverse to human health before the international Space Station begins its operations.
Important findings from SLS-2 included independent demonstration by three different investigator teams that current models for understanding the effects of gravity on the heart, lungs, and circulation could not predict the observed physiological responses during space flight.
These studies will yield important new understanding of blood pressure regulation, in health and disease, and of cardiopulmonary disorders.
Researchers also learned that a surprising degree of neural plasticity results from exposure to microgravity.
These results will improve our understanding of the nervous system's adaptation to change.
Research into the role that physical loading (gravity) plays in maintaining muscle function--combining anatomy, biochemistry, and functional measures--will help the joint NASA-National Institutes of Health (NIH) program in muscle physiology.
The flight of a cosmonaut on STS-60 in February 1994 began Phase 1 of the international Space Station.
In August, the first launch of United States research hardware aboard a Russian Progress rocket included an acceleration measurement system to support both United States and Russian research programs.
Additional United States hardware is being tested and shipped to Russia for launch aboard Progress rockets next year.
Ultimately, a planned International Space Research and Technology Institute will sponsor new interdisciplinary teams consisting of biologists, technologists, physicists, and material scientists to do research both on Earth and in the Space Station, bringing fresh insight and methodology to bear on problems humans face.
Meanwhile, in March 1994 NASA flew the USMP-2--a facility exposed to the space environment in the Shuttle payload bay that provides power, cooling, and data collection for a variety of experiments.
The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment advanced our knowledge of materials science.
Dendrite growth is the common form of crystal growth encountered when metals, alloys, and many other materials solidify in most industrial processes.
Study of the formation of dendrites in orbit showed conclusively that in order to provide rigorous tests of fundamental theories of dendrite formation and development, long-duration, high-quality microgravity conditions are required.
These theories are needed to predict and achieve in solidified materials the desired microstructures that control many of their physical and chemical properties such as their mechanical strength and resistance to corrosion.
The Crystal Growth of Solid Solution Semiconductors Experiment, using the Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace on its first mission, successfully grew a crystal of mercury cadmium telluride alloy, a semiconductor, to study the physics of additive thermal- and composition-driven convection during crystal growth.
The in-situ monitoring available in the MEPHISTO (French--Material pour l'Etude des Phenomenes Interessant la Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite) apparatus enabled the study of transport and kinetic phenomena during crystal growth of bismuth/tin alloys.
The MEPHISTO furnace, developed by the French Space Agency and shared by United States and French investigators under a cooperative agreement, has the unique ability to study the formation of microstructures in solidifying materials to help understand how metals acquire their physical properties.
The Critical Fluid Light Scattering Experiment studied phase transition phenomena near the critical point of the element, xenon.
Studying an area known to physicists as dynamic critical phenomena, this experiment provided theorists with new guidance for modeling how systems with many degrees of freedom respond to fluctuations.
Such models can help interpret such varied phenomena as atmospheric turbulence, human population dynamics, and superconductivity.
IML-2 in July 1994 continued IML-1's exploration of the effects of gravitational force on biological, physical, and chemical systems.
Some 82 investigations sent into orbit by 75 principal investigators from 13 countries showed how crewed space laboratories can be used with high efficiency in international investigations such as those to be done on the Space Station.
On IML-2, 11 major United States microgravity experiments used new flight apparatuses developed by NASA's international partners.
Four United States investigator teams used the German electromagnetic containerless processing facility (TEMPUS) to conduct studies of nucleation in solidification while also measuring thermophysical properties. One United States investigator used ESA's Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility, flown on its first long-duration mission, to study crystallization of macromolecules using the "liquid-liquid diffusion technique."
Another United States investigator successfully completed protocols to study the phenomenon of liquid-phase sintering--a process used to produce alloys of novel compositions from high-temperature materials--in the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan's Large Isothermal Furnace.
Two United States investigator teams studied liquid-phase interactions using ESA's Bubble, Drop, and Particle Unit, and one United States investigator group studied phase changes, employing ESA's Critical Point Facility.
Preliminary results from the mission include new insights into the transport of mass and energy in systems at vapor-liquid critical point--a unique condition of matter that promises to reveal important new understanding of complex systems on scales ranging from the atom to global weather and of subtle changes such as the magnetization of an iron bar or the way substances transition from conductivity to superconductivity; and observations of surface-tension driven motions of drops and bubbles under conditions of strongly-coupled heat and momentum transport.
The IML-2 studies of radiation biology showed damage to living cells as an effect of the natural space environment.
Nematode worms showed a significant number of mutations compared to control specimens but no unusual reproductive behavior.
Investigations on animals and plants exhibited the effects of microgravity and radiation on growth patterns, genetic material, bone development, cell differentiation and reproduction, and the effectiveness of antibiotics.
The first documented, successful vertebrate reproduction in space involved mating and hatching Medaka fish eggs.
One fry resulting from in-space fertilization actually hatched and survived, as did prefertilized eggs.
Two newt eggs, laid on orbit, survived, and a high percentage of pre-orbit selected eggs remained viable as embryos and larvae.
In another first occurrence in space, researchers established a gravity threshold, the point where gravity's effects can be observed, for two organisms--Euglena and jellyfish.
Fruit flies exposed to microgravity exhibited hyperactivity compared to control specimens on Earth, indicating an accelerated aging process in space.
At the request of the governments of Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia, NASA life scientists associated with Space Radar Laboratory-2 received data in October 1994 on Shuttle passes over the two countries.
This data will support technological developments and environmental monitoring in response to concerns of those governments about pollution and disease control.
NASA continued in FY 1994 to make strides in the field of Telemedicine, the practice of medicine across distances using a phone line, satellite, microwave or other telecommunications medium.
The Spacebridge to Moscow Telemedicine Demonstration Project, a flagship program in this arena begun in November 1993, uses two-way, interactive video between clinical consultants at the Moscow Hospital of the Ministry of Information and four clinical sites in the United States.
Remote aid in diagnosing patients under this project constitutes a successful follow-on to the Spacebridge to Armenia in 1988.
Regenerative life support research has led to significant advance in the development of new biofilm resistant coatings using application techniques common in industry.
NASA initiated this research to control or prevent the buildup of medically harmful microorganisms in the air, water, and trace-contaminant control systems of long-duration on crewed spacecraft.
Preliminary results (independently confirmed by the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University) show a 50 to 90+ percent reduction in buildup of a common biofilm-forming organism when the coating is applied to plastics or metal.
The coated surface is heat-stable, thus allowing sterilization and reuse.
Of particular note, the coated surface is also extremely easy to clean.
These coatings may have application to preventing biofilm buildup in a number of commercially important areas.
Preliminary estimates by the Center for Biofilm Engineering and the EPA conservatively estimate the commercial potential of these technologies in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
NASA also continued its close cooperation with other Government agencies in research.
A joint biotechnology program between NASA and the NIH emphasized establishing joint centers to accelerate transfer of NASA technology and allow its application to biomedical research, developing advanced tissue-culturing technology for application to biomedical research and developmental biology; advanced protein crystallization technologies to advance structural biology and drug design to fight diseases; and technology for early detection of cataracts.
At the end of the fiscal year, NASA had 18 cooperative agreements with 10 institutes of NIH as well as the National Library of Medicine.
Under an interagency agreement between NASA and the NIH, the two agencies established a Center for Three-Dimensional Tissue Culture at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
This agreement supports the transfer of NASA's bioreactor technology to NIH, its further development with NASA support, more protein crystal growth flight experiments, and new investigations of microgravity cell culture.
Additionally, NASA and NIH have selected 22 investigators to fly life science experiments on the Space Shuttle in the period 1994-1996, the first such NASA/NIH spaceflight experiments; and 34 investigators for Neurolab, a Spacelab mission to fly on the Shuttle in 1998, dedicated to brain and behavioral sciences.
NASA has also signed agreements with the National Cancer Institute, the National Library of Medicine, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to do research in areas of common interest.
In 1994 NASA received 141 proposals in biotechnology in response to a research announcement.
Peer reviews in FY 1995 will determine which will be pursued further.
NASA and the National Cancer Institute will apply the imaging technology used in HST and elsewhere to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
Three projects in particular offer the promise of developing direct digital mammography systems with high resolution and a wide field of view.
With the National Institute of Mental Health, NASA will help to apply recent advances in computer and information sciences to the brain and related health sciences.
In related endeavors, NASA, the Air Force, and GTE Corporation recently completed a program studying the growth of gallium arsenide in the space environment.
NASA also funds a protein crystal growth program at the Naval Research Laboratory, and under a NASA agreement with the DoD, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research has been conducting cell culture research in a flight system.
A memorandum of understanding between NASA and the NSF has committed those two agencies to collaborative research in environmental signal transduction and cell differentiation in plants in response to environmental stimulation, especially gravity.
Another agreement between NASA and the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Association of America will use the technology developed for cooling systems in space suits to develop cool suit technology for victims of MS who have trouble regulating internal body temperature.
A result from a joint project development effort between NASA's Ames Research Center and the NSF's Closed Ecological Life Support System Antarctic Analog Project will be NASA's largest-scale application to date in bioregenerative life support technology and will also feature a recycling system to support Antarctic researchers. Designed to increase the habitability of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station and help the United States meet its international obligations to maintain the Antarctic environment in a pristine condition, this project will allow NASA to meet the goal of obtaining long-duration experience in a similar environment to test regenerative life-support candidates for planetary habitats by deploying regenerative food, water, and waste-processing systems for use at the South Pole.
D. Space shuttle
The Space Shuttle's primary purpose continued in FY 1994 to be transporting people and cargo safely into low-Earth orbit (180 to 600 kilometers above the Earth).
As of the end of the year, NASA had four active orbiters in its fleet: Columbia, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour.
During FY 1994 Atlantis completed its Orbiter Maintenance Down Period (OMDP) in the Orbiter Facility in Palmdale, California.
During OMDP, Atlantis was outfitted with the modifications necessary to dock with the Russian Mir space station, with the first docking mission scheduled for the third quarter of FY 1995.
As the year ended, the orbiter Columbia was being prepared for delivery to Palmdale for an OMDP.
During the year, NASA initiated a redesign of the external tank for structural weight reduction, which will improving the performance of the Shuttle system.
The redesign involved substitution of aluminum lithium for the existing aluminum alloy, thus taking advantage of the greater strength per unit of weight characteristic of the new material.
The first launch of the resultant super lightweight tank will be in late calendar year 1997.
The Space Shuttle Main Engine program aggressively pursued the development and implementation of safety and reliability improvements in FY 1994.
In the current engine, five major components were in the process of being upgraded in two block changes.
Block I incorporates the new phase II+ powerhead, the single-coil heat-exchanger, and the alternate high pressure oxidizer turbopump.
Block II contains the Block I improvements and adds the alternate high pressure fuel turbopump and the large throat main combustion chamber.
Engineers conducted 101 ground tests in FY 1994 for a total of 47,775 seconds in support of the development and current flight programs.
To date, the oxidizer turbopump has satisfied its requirements for total development seconds and the first of two formal certification units has successfully completed its 20 test series.
The first Block I certification engine, which contained the second oxidizer turbopump certification unit, began testing in October 1994.
As of the end of the fiscal year, Block I was scheduled for its first flight in June 1995.
Engineers involved in the oxidizer turbopump development successfully resolved all of the major technical problems encountered early in development.
Due in large part to this success, Congress approved the resumption of development work on the fuel turbopump, which had been in caretaker status since 1991.
Development testing of the fuel turbopump was underway at the end of the fiscal year, and the Block II configuration was scheduled to enter service in September 1997.
The Space Shuttle Main Engine program has also been pursuing performance enhancing changes in engine operation for Block II--part of the overall Shuttle performance enhancement program to support Space Station objectives.
The Solid Rocket Booster successfully supported the eight Shuttle flights begun during FY 1994.
There was one static test firing of a heavily instrumented flight support motor.
Efforts began to transition Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor nozzle production from Utah to the former Advanced Solid Rocket Motor site in northeast Mississippi.
Elimination of ozone-depleting substances in booster manufacturing continued.
Engineers have been developing two performance enhancements related to the booster as part of the overall Shuttle performance enhancement program to support Space Station objectives.
A motor nozzle exit cone extension will increase the vacuum specific impulse of the motor.
The lightweight booster program will replace the current nylon parachutes with kevlar versions and will include minor structural weight reductions.
In the area of Space Shuttle Systems Integration, the Day-of-Launch I-Load-Update (DOLILU I) system was available for all FY 1994 missions.
The system updates the flight trajectory to account for the actual winds on the day of launch.
The DOLILU II system, which will incorporate the main engine control tables, solid rocket trim data, and aerodynamic control data on the day of launch, will further optimize the ascent trajectory of the Shuttle.
NASA expected the first flight using this improvement to occur in May 1995.
Integration efforts during FY 1994 also included analyses of structural loads; resolution of in-flight anomalies, waivers, and changes; and software development and testing for the control of each mission.
To support the international Space Station mission requirements, NASA has initiated efforts to identify, develop, and baseline Shuttle performance enhancements.
Engineers have developed systems integration plans to ensure their orderly implementation into the Space Shuttle program.
Analyses were underway at the end of the year to ensure the compatibility of design modifications to the external tank, main engine, solid rocket boosters, and the orbiter itself.
Engineers have specified design analyses and test requirements to provide definition of flight margins.
All of the enhancements have been specified in support of the first international Space Station assembly flight scheduled for December 1997.
During 1994, the Space Shuttle ground processing team at KSC achieved several innovations and enhancements that increased efficiency, improved scheduling, and reduced costs.
A reliability-centered maintenance program continually adjusted procedures based on actual performance data and operational experience.
An integrated work control system, still under development, has already streamlined and automated work control functions related to more than 10,000 major tasks performed in preparing an orbiter's 22 major systems for flight.
It has prestaged work packages, provided automated notification of needs for parts and material, and thereby reduced the numbers of tasks experiencing holds.
Another improvement in ground processing involves selecting a team leader from a work unit, training him or her, and defining the responsibilities and authority for processing tasks from planning to completion. This enables problems to be resolved at the lowest operational level while providing structure and cohesiveness to the effort.
The task team leader concept has enhanced Shuttle processing, facilitated teamwork, minimized delays, and improved quality.
Over 4,400 NASA and contractor personnel have received training in this concept, which has been employed successfully in all areas of the operation.
E. Satellites Following the loss of Landsat-6 in October 1996, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) continued to rely on Landsat-5, in operation since 1984.
The Landsat series has provided regular observations of the surface of the Earth for two decades, monitoring renewable and nonrenewable resources.
Landsat data applications support programs such as global change research, coastal zone monitoring, timber management, regional planning, and environmental monitoring.
On May 10, 1994, the White House announced the Landsat Remote Sensing Strategy, which provides for continuity of existing Landsat and future Landsat-type data.
The strategy assigned Landsat-7 program responsibilities jointly to NASA, NOAA, and USGS.
NASA assumed the satellite-development responsibilities for Landsat-7 from the DoD.
NASA and NOAA will jointly develop the ground system, which NOAA will operate in cooperation with the USGS.
The Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center of the USGS will continue to be responsible for maintaining Government archives of Landsat and other land-related remote-sensing data.
Landsat-7, planned for launch in December 1998, will carry an improved Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM-Plus).
The successful April 13, 1994, launch of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-I, renamed GOES-8 once it achieved orbit, resulted in more precise and timely weather observation and provision of data on the atmosphere.
Its design, featuring three-axis stabilization, permits the satellite's sensors to observe the Earth continuously, compared to only 5 percent of the time for current spin-stabilized satellites.
The first in a series of five advanced weather satellites to be launched over the next several years, GOES-8 was checked out and fine-tuned by NASA for 6 months after launch.
Thus, NOAA did not obtain control over the satellite until after the end of the fiscal year.
NASA, which procures launches and checkouts for the GOES series of satellites and manages their design, development, and launch, planned to launch GOES-J in 1995 to replace GOES-7, which has already exceeded its expected lifetime.
NOAA is responsible for the operations, including command and control, data receipt, and product generation and distribution for the satellites.
In a totally different area, NOAA announced at the beginning of the calendar year that two new ground stations had been added to the network of satellite search and rescue facilities throughout the United States. Located in Guam and Puerto Rico, they were the final of six new, fully automated installations designed to upgrade the satellite search and rescue system, which helps to bring emergency assistance to mariners, ground-based users, and pilots in distress.
The stations and four others installed in the United States over the preceding year and a half are part of an international satellite search and rescue system known as COSPAS-SARSAT (from a Russian acronym meaning Space System for Search of Vessels in Distress and an English one for Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System).
The system enables distress signals from ships or airplanes to be received and processed more quickly than before.
It uses a total of six NOAA environmental satellites and Russian navigational satellites, plus a network of ground stations to pick up radio and beacon signals from the distressed individuals and send them via mission control centers like NOAA's in Suitland, Maryland, to rescue coordination centers.
Since the inception of the system in 1982, a total of 4,310 lives had been saved as of September 30, 1994--960 of them during calendar year 1993.
The Small Expendable Tether Deployable System-2 (SEDS-2), conceived and designed by SAO, was a secondary payload on a Delta II rocket launched at 10:40 p.m. EST on March 9, 1994, from Cape Canaveral AFS, Florida.
At a length of nearly 20 kilometers, it was the longest object ever placed in space.
At 11:45 p.m., the Delta's second stage ejected the 23-kilogram SEDS-2, using a spring-loaded device.
The minisatellite reached a final deployed length of 19.8 kilometers in just 1 hour 48 minutes, achieving the primary purpose of the experiment, to suspend such a payload with a minimum of swing.
Thereafter, SEDS-2 remained in space to determine the resistance of its braided polyethelene to micrometeoroids, space debris, and atomic oxygen.
The tether apparently was severed by a micrometeoroid (or debris) on March 15.
Thereafter, the end of the tether reentered the upper atmosphere and burned, while about 10 to 12 kilometers of its length remained attached to the rocket's second stage and continued orbiting until May 8, 1994.
This marked the third SAO-developed tether launched within the past year, each on time and with an increasingly ambitious goal.
F. Space station
Fiscal year 1994 was a time of tremendous accomplishment for the international Space Station program.
In October 1993, the program formally developed an initial set of specifications, including Russian elements as part of the design.
In December 1993, the original 12 participating nations in Space Station Freedom (the United States, Canada, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, and Japan) extended an official invitation to Russia to join the partnership, and Russia accepted.
The existing Shuttle/Mir program was then expanded and made Phase I of the international Space Station program.
In February 1994, the Phase I activity officially began when Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian to fly on the Space Shuttle.
NASA astronauts Bonnie Dunbar and Norm Thagard have been training to fly on the Mir space station since March 1994 at the Russian Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City.
The first American was scheduled to be launched on a Russian spacecraft to Mir in March 1995.
All of the international Space Station program partners took part in a successful systems design review at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Texas, in March 1994.
On June 23, 1994, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and Russian Space Agency (RSA) Director General Yuri N. Koptev signed a NASA/RSA interim agreement on Space Station and a $400 million contract.
The agreement permits Russian participation in joint program management bodies and the contract covers Russian provision of hardware and data in the program's early phases (primarily for Shuttle-Mir activities).
Additionally, on August 31, 1994, NASA and the Boeing Company signed a memorandum of agreement that defined the content and maximum cost of the prime contract, scheduled for signature by late 1994.
Also during August, the program completed a vehicle architecture review.
Finally, on September 28, 1994, the Space Station Control Board examined the vehicle architecture review and ratified its recommended modifications to the assembly sequence and element requirements for the Space Station.
The redesign of the Space Station that resulted from these activities preserved the best of the previous Space Station Freedom program's hardware and capability, while adding increased research capability and user flexibility.
The new international Space Station costs $5 billion less than Freedom. It has adopted a streamlined management structure and significantly reduced the number of civil service personnel and contractors assigned to the program.
It has adopted an integrated product team approach, using the skills of the civil service workforce to develop a number of Station elements more economically and efficiently, saving millions of dollars in the process.
Furthermore, Russian cooperation has added greater capability to the international Space Station and further reduced United States costs, making the Station an important aspect in the new and evolving relationship between the two countries.
To date, the program has produced 12,000 kilograms of Space Station hardware--about 1,000 kilograms more than projected.
There has been a number of successful technical interchange meetings with the Russians, and Russia has begun delivery of items called for in the contract signed in June.
Before the end of the fiscal year, a NASA liaison team was in place in Moscow, and NASA was working with the Russians to get their liaison office established in Houston.
At a technical interchange meeting in August 1994, NASA and the RSA agreed on a number of important integration and operations issues, such as how command and control orders would be sent to the Space Station.
Joint management team discussions in Moscow the following month continued and expanded these efforts, resulting in agreement on matters necessary for working together, such as the use of English as the common language.
Meanwhile, the new Canadian government recently reaffirmed support for the international Space Station.
Canada has been restructuring government spending to reduce its debt.
In the face of difficult budget decisions, the Canadian government has continued to recognize its responsibility for developing the Mobile Servicing System, which will provide external Space Station robotics.
Canada also planned to develop the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator for more delicate robotic operations.
ESA has continued to develop the Columbus Orbital Facility (COF--a pressurized laboratory) and laboratory support equipment for early scientific use.
ESA has also been developing the Ariane V launch vehicle and associated transfer vehicles; as FY 1994 ended, it was involved in discussions with NASA on a possible role for these vehicles in Space Station logistics resupply.
ESA conducted a design-to-cost exercise on the COF, coordinating the technical and management changes closely with NASA.
The Europeans have expressed interest in examining the possibilities for providing a crew rescue vehicle and also an automated transfer vehicle, which would provide propellant resupply and reboost.
Japan has been developing the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), consisting of a multipurpose pressurized laboratory element, an unpressurized exposed facility, a remote manipulator system, and experiments logistics modules.
Japan's Space Station program has been making steady progress, with 63 percent of its development funds contracted out.
G. Nuclear energy
To date, the United States has successfully employed 37 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG's) on over 20 spacecraft launches.
An RTG is a device without moving parts that converts the heat from the decay of the radioisotope Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) into electricity.
RTG's have shown the flexibility and ability to operate beyond specified mission lifetimes demanded by a variety of space missions.
For instance, the multi-hundred-watt RTG on the Voyager 2 spacecraft, launched in 1977, has continued to operate as it has travelled beyond Neptune into space.
The Department of Energy (DoE) has developed a new model RTG with a more efficient fuel design called the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS).
The GPHS-RTG operated successfully on the Galileo and Ulysses missions, launched in 1989 and 1990, respectively.
DoE program activities in 1994 focused on production of both GPHS components and GPHS-RTG thermoelectric converters to meet the requirements for power of the Cassini mission to Saturn, scheduled for a 1997 launch.
The Savannah River Plant in South Carolina processed the majority of the Pu-238 needed to fuel the three new RTG's.
In 1994, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee completed production of all the iridium parts that will be used to encapsulate the Pu-238 fuel.
Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, pressed the initial flight pellets of Pu-238 and welded these pellets into the iridium capsules.
The agency will release the preliminary safety analysis report in late 1994.
The Mound Plant of EG&G Mound Applied Technologies in Miamisburg, Ohio, was proceeding according to plan with RTG assembly preparation activities as the fiscal year ended.
The prime system contractor, Martin Marietta Astrospace, completed the production of all thermo-electric elements for all three RTG's during the year, and fabrication activities on other portions of the RTG's remained on schedule.
DoE also developed new conceptual designs for smaller and lighter-weight RTG's for the Pluto Fast Flyby mission, whose specifications call for it to be powered by RTG's.
Later in 1994, DoE will issue a comprehensive report responding to a General Accounting Office inquiry regarding the long-term production capability of RTG's.
DoE intends to retain its unique capabilities to provide special nuclear power sources for other agencies' needs.
H. Other space technology
During FY 1994, NASA made significant progress in measuring, modeling, and mitigating the orbital-debris environment.
This completed the third year that the Haystack Orbital Debris Radar, operated for NASA by MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, has measured and monitored such debris.
This powerful radar can detect debris as small as a pea orbiting 600 kilometers out in space.
At low altitudes (400-600 kilometers) it measured less debris than predicted--good news for the international Space Station.
However, at higher altitudes (800-1000 kilometers) the debris population was greater than NASA had predicted.
Because objects in higher orbits are not significantly affected by changes in solar activity, their lifetimes can exceed 1,000 years, meaning that they will not pose a hazard to the Space Station, but they are a threat to scientific, Earth observation, weather, and communications satellites.
On February 9, 1994, the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres (ODERACS-1) were deployed from Space Shuttle Discovery. The purpose of these six spheres ranging in diameter from 5 to 15 centimeters, is to improve the ability of ground based radars to detect and track small debris objects.
The spheres are expected to remain in orbit providing valuable calibration data until mid-1995.
NASA also developed a portable telescope that is capable of detecting objects as small as one-half inch in diameter at altitudes ranging from that of the Space Station (400-650 kilometers) through Sun-synchronous altitudes (800-1000 kilometers) and objects as small as 5 to 10 centimeters at geosynchronous altitude (36,000 kilometers).
This Liquid Metal Mirror Telescope (LMMT) concept is based on the research of Dr. E.F. Borra of Laval University in Quebec, Canada, in the area of liquid mercury mirrors.
The prototype 3-meters-diameter LMMT now in operation at NASA's JSC is the 17th largest telescope in the world. It was built at a cost of about $500,000--1/100th the cost of comparable Earth-based astronomical telescopes.
To reduce construction costs, NASA designed the LMMT to be housed in a grain silo purchased on the commercial market.
Operational software costs were minimized by modifying software previously developed for JSC's Charge Coupled Device Debris Telescope.
In a somewhat related effort to forecast space weather and thus to assess the likelihood of damage to satellite components, scientists at Rice University developed sophisticated computer models to calculate the density and energy of particles at any point in space.
They constructed maps similar to those used by meteorologists showing the flow of plasma in the ionosphere and the characteristics of ions and electrons precipitating into the atmosphere.
Using high time resolution, the scientists calculated the way in which the plasma flow changed in response to conditions in the solar wind. They displayed the results graphically as a movie.
More than 50 scientists then carried out coordinated observational campaigns to validate the results of the model.
I. Communications satellites
There were three new commercial domestic fixed satellites launched for the United States during FY 1994.
Galaxy 1R(S), launched on February 19, 1994, will provide video services into the next decade.
The satellite completed systems checkout and in-orbit testing at longitude 89 degrees W. in January 1994 and was then moved to longitude 97 degrees W. to begin providing television and data communications services for United States customers in early February.
Unfortunately, the September 9, 1994, launch of Telstar 402 by an Ariane launch vehicle from Kourou, French Guiana, was not as successful.
The launch itself went fine, but operators lost contact with the satellite after it evidently began spinning as it passed over the Indian Ocean.
Customers such as Fox Broadcasting and ABC will continue to use Telstar 401 until Telstar 403, redesignated Telstar 402R, is launched.
Two other communications satellites that were not in the domestic fixed category but did provide domestic service were the first Direct Broadcast Satellites (DBS).
Launched by an Ariane booster from Kourou, French Guiana, on December 17, 1993, DBS-1, as the satellite is designated by its co-owners, DirecTv and United States Satellite Broadcasting, offered some 75-80 channels of television service after April 1994 to United States subscribers or those purchasing the equipment necessary for reception.
Located at longitude 101 degrees W., the HS 601 satellite built by Hughes Space and Communications Company provided broadcasting to all of the contiguous 48 states.
It was followed on August 3, 1994, by DBS-2, successfully launched from Cape Canaveral AFS by a Martin Marietta Atlas IIA.
It increased the number of channels available on the service to 150.
Still another communications satellite placed into orbit during the fiscal year was PanAmSat's PAS-2--designated PAS-4 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). An Ariane 4 rocket launched it into space from Kourou, French Guiana, on July 8, 1994.
The 2,920-kilogram satellite was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. and became PanAmSat's first private international satellite for the Pacific Ocean Region, providing television coverage from the Western United States to the Asian mainland.
It marks the second of four satellites scheduled to constitute PanAmSat's Global Satellite System, begun with PAS-1 launched in June 1988 and providing services to the Atlantic Ocean Region.
Also a Hughes HS 601 satellite, PAS-4 can carry more than 320 digital channels transmitted on 16 63-watt Ku-band and 16 34-watt C-band transponders.
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), a consortium established in 1964 and consisting (in September 1994) of 134 member nations that owned and operated the world's most extensive global communications satellite system with service in more than 200 countries and territories, successfully launched its INTELSAT 701 satellite on October 22, 1993, aboard an Ariane 44LP rocket.
The first in its series of high-powered INTELSAT VII spacecraft, INTELSAT 701 began commercial service on January 15, 1994, with the transfer of traffic from the INTELSAT 510 satellite launched in March 1985.
Situated at longitude 174 degrees E., the Space Systems/Loral satellite began providing expanded telephone, television, and other services to INTELSAT customers in the Pacific Ocean Region, including the west coast of North America, the islands in the Pacific, and the east coast of Asia.
Most long-distance carriers of telephone service in North America and the Asia-Pacific Region began using the new satellite, which handles 90,000 telephone calls at once versus the 75,000 transmitted by the 510 satellite.
In addition, the 701 transmits three television channels at a time instead of the two channels transmitted by INTELSAT 501.
On June 17, 1994, INTELSAT successfully launched the second of nine VII-VII-A satellites ordered from Space Systems/Loral aboard an Ariane 44LP launch vehicle from Kourou, French Guiana.
After moving from its in-orbit test location, INTELSAT 702 began commercial service on August 13, 1994, at longitude 359 degrees E., replacing the lower-capacity INTELSAT 512.
Serving as the only direct one-hop communications link between the Indian subcontinent and America (North and South), INTELSAT 702 provides expanded communications services to INTELSAT's customers in Africa, Europe, the Indian sub-continent, the Middle East, the Eastern United States, and South America.
The new satellite is the 50th that INTELSAT has launched; 22 of these remain in operation providing customers such business services as international video, teleconferencing, facsimile, data, and telex.
The International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), a London-based international entity with 75 member countries as the fiscal year ended, did not add to its complement of four INMARSAT II and seven older satellites providing mobile satellite communications in the air, on land and sea for almost 40,000 users of mobile terminals in more than 165 countries.
Among the organization's accomplishments during the year was the world's first satellite voice connection to a cellular-sized phone, Inmarsat announced in March 1994.
The event occurred during trials for a future global handheld phone system to test the power margins needed to provide voice service between 1998 and 2000.
Meanwhile, in September 1994, a London department store began selling the INMARSAT-M briefcase satellite telephone.
The lid of the briefcase serves as the antenna for the telephone inside.
Also during the year, the United States Communications Satellite (Comsat) Corporation, which holds (roughly) a 23-percent share in Inmarsat, opened a new station in Kuantan, Malaysia, on July 1, 1994.
This new station plus existing ones in Santa Paula, California, and Southbury, Connecticut, made Comsat the first Inmarsat service provider to operate digital mobile satellite services around the globe.
J. Space network
On November 29, 1993, NASA repositioned its first Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-1), launched in 1983 and already serving beyond its 10-year lifetime, to recover scientific data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), launched in 1991.
A significant portion of GRO data would otherwise have been lost due to the failure of a tape recorder on the spacecraft.
NASA installed a highly automated ground terminal, GRO Remote Terminal System (GRTS), at its Deep Space Network location in Australia to control TDRS-1.
This terminal is remotely operated from the TDRS System (TDRSS) ground stations in New Mexico.
TDRS-1 started relaying data operationally on December 6, 1993, during the shift from its former to its new location, a year from project start.
With TDRS-1 and GRTS, NASA has extended real-time data retrieval to the full orbit for GRO, which is studying the evolution of the universe, the nature of puzzling astronomical objects, and the processes that produce very-high-energy radiation.
NASA has begun making TDRSS available to United States industry to conduct experiments and demonstrations of innovative satellite communications technologies and concepts free of charge.
The intent of this Mobile Satellite Communications via the TDRSS (MOST) program is to enhance the competitiveness of the United States industry in the global satellite communications arena.
TDRSS enables testing of lightweight, mobile, handheld satellite communication terminals in a variety of environmental conditions.
Already, the tracking system has been used to demonstrate satellite broadcast of compact disk (CD)-quality radio to conduct measurements of path diversity for commercial mobile satellite communications.
Applications of the technologies validated by MOST include, for example: listening to CD-quality radio while driving across the country; communicating by handheld, wireless devices anywhere in the world, no matter how remote; and communication by hikers in remote areas during emergencies.
The MOST activity does not interfere with the primary TDRSS mission of relaying commands to and data from scientific spacecraft.
K. Ground networks
NASA uses ground-based telecommunications facilities to provide telemetry, command, and navigation services to a number of NASA, other United States, and international spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle; other Earth-orbiting spacecraft; planetary orbiters; and international spacecraft.
These spacecraft include the Space Shuttle and Earth-orbiters; planetary orbiters such as Galileo and Magellan; and the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft travelling to the outer reaches of our solar system.
Other uses of ground network facilities include tracking and data acquisition services to sounding rocket, high-altitude balloon, and aeronautical research missions.
This worldwide capability has enabled mission operators to navigate their spacecraft, configure them for scientific observations, and recover the resulting scientific data.
During the past year, the recovery of additional image data from the 1993 encounter of the Galileo spacecraft with the asteroid Ida showed the asteroid had a moon.
Magellan, which had been providing scientific data about Venus for several years, concluded its mission in a final experiment as its orbit decreased and it entered the planet's atmosphere.
In addition, radar image data received from the Clementine spacecraft provided detailed maps of the Moon's surfaces, and data from the international solar mission, Ulysses, provided unique observations of the southern hemisphere of the Sun.
L. Terrestrial studies and applications
Terrestrial studies themselves encompass a broad range of activities. Among them was NASA's demonstration during FY 1994 of two new techniques for observing the environment from space.
The first of these was a multifrequency, multipolarization radar--the most complex civilian radar ever flown in space--to study the ecology, water cycles, vegetative cover, as well as oceanography, geology, and volcanology.
In cooperation with Italy and Germany, the Space Radar Laboratory flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during April (SRL-1) and September-October 1994 (SRL-2).
These missions have enabled a team of 52 scientists and ground teams around the world to observe the shifting boundaries between temperate and boreal (northern) forests, plus other natural phenomena.
The results will be used for mapmaking, study, and interpretation.
For example, the USGS has begun studying the Sahara in North Africa, the southern part of Africa, Asia, and the Southwestern United States using images from the SRL.
Because radar signals penetrate dry sand and produce images of geologic features otherwise concealed by windblown sand in desert regions, the radar laboratory's images are being used to map the distribution of various geologic indicators of climate change and of untapped resources, particularly those related to old, dry river systems.
During April and May of 1994, NASA and the Canadian Government conducted a campaign known as the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS)--a large-scale, ground-based and remote-sensing investigation of how the forests and the atmosphere exchange energy, heat, water, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases.
SRL-1 repeatedly imaged BOREAS ground sites, allowing scientists to compare the spaceborne data with their readings from ground and aircraft investigations.
Sample results indicate that water evaporation rates in the boreal (northern) forests of central Canada are extremely low.
This data will correct current models that over-predict atmospheric moisture.
In a tangentially related development, in August 1994 NASA, NOAA, and the Canadian Space Agency reached final agreement on the data policy for the Canadian Radarsat spacecraft.
Once launched, Radarsat will map the world, collecting all-weather data of particular value over ice and oceans.
The program plan calls for tilting the satellite to provide a complete mapping of Antarctica as one of the mission objectives.
The second of NASA's new techniques for environmental observation was lidar--using a laser in a manner similar to radar by bouncing it off objects (e.g. clouds, pollutants, the Earth's surface) and then making environmental measurements from the reflected energy.
The LIDAR In-Space Technology Experiment (LITE) flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery in September and observed clouds invisible to conventional weather satellites, dust clouds over Africa, and the structure of a super typhoon in the Pacific, including the top level of clouds and the storm's eye.
In June 1994, meanwhile, NASA announced that it had competitively selected two industry-led teams to build, launch, and operate two experimental satellites--each no bigger than a console television set and commonly referred to as "Lewis and Clark"--as part of NASA's small spacecraft technology demonstration.
The entire contract process lasted only 70 days instead of the standard 6 months to a year.
"Lewis" will be the first-ever space-based "hyper-spectral" imaging system, with wide applications in Earth science and new commercial business opportunities.
"Clark" will help city planners and developers evaluate sites and construction needs through the use of an optical element with very high spatial resolution and capabilities for stereo imaging.
Both spacecraft will carry additional instruments that will provide information on the dynamics of global atmospheric pollution for NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).
MTPE has included education and public awareness as part of its vision to ensure that the public has sufficient information and understanding to support development of prudent policy in the future regarding global environmental change.
Significant efforts are underway at the Federal and agency levels and within MTPE to coordinate and convey program results more effectively.
In this connection, so as to be a catalyst for progress, NASA has begun addressing educational challenges at several levels--training the next generation of Earth scientists who will approach global change from an interdisciplinary perspective, training teachers at the undergraduate level to provide the tools to teach Earth system science, and educating the public at the societal level to build confidence in and understanding of scientific methods.
One of the priorities of the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is to address and contribute to scientific education and communications.
In April 1994, Vice President Gore announced Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE), a major new initiative to have students from around the world make measurements, submit them to a central source for processing, and analyze the collective findings.
Scientists will be able to use the results in their environmental research.
NOAA and NASA have been leading this effort with contributions from NSF, EPA, the State Department, and other agencies.
The agencies of the USGCRP made significant progress during the year in improving coordination in education and outreach, including development of teacher training materials, provision of fellowships in environmental research, and contributions to new national standards for the teaching of science.
NASA-sponsored analysis of data from Landsat-4 and -5 for 1978 and 1988 showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon Basin was lower than some previous estimates had suggested.
However, the fragmentation of the rain forest and the "edge effects" on the perimeters of these fragments were greater than had been believed, potentially increasing the threat of species extinction.
Tropical forests are home to nearly half of all plant and animal species on Earth.
Researchers concluded that while the area of deforestation had nearly tripled in the 10-year period, the total deforested area was smaller than predicted by many other studies.
Working in close cooperation with researchers from Brazil, the authors of the study validated the use of Landsat data for estimating deforestation in the Amazon, previously an issue of substantial controversy.
Other researchers also demonstrated Landsat's effectiveness by combining its imagery with GIS technology to identify types and location of landscape elements associated with the risk of Lyme disease in Westchester County, New York.
Also, analysis of data from a combination of Landsat, airborne, and ground-based scanners continued to be used to battle pest damage to California's $10 billion-a-year wine industry.
About 65 percent of Napa and Sonoma counties' vineyards are planted with a grape rootstock vulnerable to a new variety of phylloxera, an aphid-like insect that kills grapevines by sucking juice from their roots.
The spatial and spectral analysis from Landsat's scanners can detect problems before they become visible to vintners.
Relatedly, USGS' EROS Data Center is the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for data about land processes to be acquired and distributed in support of the Earth Observation System (EOS).
Its functions include storage, management, and distribution of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, which will fly on the first EOS platform in 1998, and from Landsat-7.
The EROS Data Center was also planning to archive and distribute other data sets through its Land Processes DAAC, including data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA's polar-orbiting satellites, digital aircraft scanner data, digital topography, and associated ancillary data.
The EROS Data Center DAAC component of the EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Version 0 became operational in FY 1994, providing user access to electronic networks, interoperable catalogs, and data distribution capabilities at the EROS Data Center as well as the other DAACs.
The center was in the process of converting historical Landsat data from aging magnetic media to new cassette tapes to preserve them for future use.
It completed conversion of 352,000 Landsat Multispectral Scanner scenes acquired since 1979, and it also converted about 30 percent of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in the archive.
The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) within NOAA had a fully operational center for processing, archiving, and disseminating data from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).
It became fully operational during the fiscal year, processing data within 48 hours of collection by the Air Force and provided browse images routinely on the Internet.
Also available on Internet, NGDC's geophysical online data was accessed by an order of magnitude more users than just a year before.
Also, NGDC employees visited more than 30 different classrooms in local schools throughout the year to present workshops on such subjects as earthquakes, volcanoes, and geomagnetism.
Information management is one of the main program elements of NOAA's Climate and Global Change (C&GC) program.
It provides the scientific community with the data and information necessary to evaluate the variability of the global environment, distinguish between natural and human-induced change, and perform integrated assessments of changes in climate and their societal impacts.
Foci of the program include data base development (rescue, digitization, and assembly of high-priority data sets); data access and archive management, which provide the means to make the data sets available to scientists; and Pathfinder, which is developing community-consensus algorithms for the reprocessing and dissemination of large-volume, multidecadal, global-scale, operational-satellite data sets.
In FY 1994, the program supported governmental and academic researchers in 31 projects.
As part of the Landsat Pathfinder program, the USGS has been producing standardized Landsat Multispectral Scanner data sets from three periods (1973, 1986, and 1992) to support the EPA's North American Landscape Characterization Program.
In FY 1994, it produced about 400 out of a total of 4,000 scenes for parts of the United States, Mexico, and Central America.
USGS has also been cooperating with NASA plus the Universities of New Hampshire and Maryland to produce similar three-date-time-series Landsat data sets for the Humid Tropical Forest Inventory Project, which is studying the tropical forest regions of the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia.
These data sets will serve to monitor changes in land cover over these areas during the 20-year period since the beginning of the Landsat program.
In a separate project using lower-resolution satellite data, since 1992 the USGS has been working with NASA, NOAA, ESA, and more than 31 foreign ground receiving stations to collect AVHRR data (1-km resolution) for each afternoon pass of the NOAA polar-orbiting satellite over the Earth's land surface.
This Pathfinder project had collected over 93,000 AVHRR scenes by the end of the fiscal year.
They were being used to produce a global land-cover map and to monitor vegetation conditions (greenness) on a periodic basis throughout the year.
Routine production of cloud-free composite data for a vegetation index of all global land areas was also underway at the end of the year.
The USGS was cooperating with the EPA, NOAA, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a baseline of global, multiscale data on environmental characteristics and to develop mechanisms for identifying, monitoring, and assessing environmental change.
The resulting Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Monitoring System will be essential for understanding the dynamics of the Earth as a system.
Through a directive from OSTP, an interdisciplinary, interagency Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team formed to provide scientific advice to Federal officials making decisions about recovery and river-basin management following the severe flooding of the Upper Mississippi and Missouri River basins in 1993.
The team included specialists from USGS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Biological Survey, Soil Conservation Service, Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Working at the EROS Data Center, the team produced numerous maps and analyses, as well as a substantial environmental information system for the two basins using remotely sensed, map, and environmental data.
This includes a wide variety of data made available on Internet.
The team's preliminary report documents the data and analysis provided to the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee, which was providing policy recommendations to the Administration.
In other Department of Interior (DoI) activities, the Bureau of Reclamation used remote sensing and GIS's to aid in the management of water resources.
During FY 1994, it used aerial photographs and multispectral data from the Landsat TM and SPOT to map irrigated lands, riparian vegetation, and open water at a number of locations in the Western United States.
It used these maps and other spatial data in a GIS with environmental models to estimate consumptive water use.
Airborne video and thermal infrared scanner imagery were used to map river habitat for endangered fish in the Colorado River system, enabling managers to release water from reservoirs in such a way as to maximize survival of the endangered species.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs continued to conduct natural resource inventories, image mapping projects, and GPS training services to support its Indian Integrated Resource Information Program.
Analysts used Landsat TM data to classify land use on several Indian Reservations for forestry and wildlife management applications.
The Bureau continued land cover inventories on reservations in New Mexico and Arizona with emphasis on modeling the potential burn rate of different vegetation types in response to fires.
Landsat TM and SPOT panchromatic data enabled the Bureau to prepare image maps for three reservations, while GPS training supported resource inventory programs.
The Bureau of Land Management used remotely sensed data and GPS to monitor the health of public lands and the effectiveness of ecosystem-based management practices.
Landsat, SPOT, and AVHRR satellite data plus aerial photographs supported ecosystem-based management of mineral resources; land-use planning; fire fuels mapping; characterization of wildlife habitat; and delineation of hazardous materials and their impacts at a number of sites on public lands throughout the United States.
GIS and GPS technology supported much of this analysis.
The National Biological Survey, now one year old, has continued a wide variety of remote sensing projects transferred from other DoI bureaus.
The Gap Analysis Program, a statewide and national program to identify land areas not being protected and managed to maintain biological diversity, was one such program transferred from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
The program is based on mapping of actual natural vegetation from Landsat TM and other data using a nationwide classification system for vegetation.
Standardized mapping methods and data formats permit aggregation of State-level data for comparison at regional and national levels.
At the end of the year, projects were underway in 36 States with data from Nevada and Washington nearing completion.
With adequate funding, complete national-level data sets will be available by 1999.
The National Park Service initiated a comprehensive, multi-year program in FY 1994 to map vegetation in 235 units of the National Park System, excluding Alaska.
The program will provide consistent baseline digital data about the composition and distribution of vegetation to support the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring program.
Mapping will be done through interpretation of medium-scale (1:20,000) natural color and color-infrared aerial photographs using a nationwide standardized classification system.
The National Biological Survey is working closely with the Park Service to plan and direct the project, beginning with pilot studies in a variety of selected park environments.
With transfer of research activities to the National Biological Survey in FY 1994, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began emphasizing use of computerized mapping, aerial photographs, and Landsat and SPOT data for day-to-day operations, especially managing wildlife habitat from an ecosystem perspective.
It has used remotely sensed data and GIS technology to evaluate the effects of habitat changes on migratory birds, assess threats of environmental contaminants to biological resources like endangered species, and identify the most valuable lands for inclusion in new refuges like Canaan Valley, West Virginia.
The Service also led a Federal Geographic Data Committee effort to develop national standards for mapping wetlands and was active in a similar attempt to define a standard for mapping upland vegetation.
These activities will reduce costs for acquiring remotely sensed data and increase the consistency of the resultant maps of these resources.
The United States Bureau of Mines has directed its remote sensing research to the development of applications to abandoned mine land areas.
This innovative technology will address the identification and characterization of mineralogy of waste materials and associated potential for development of acid mine drainage and occurrence of heavy metals at these sites.
The applications utilize Landsat TM satellite images and airborne multispectral scanner data and were field tested in the Cripple Creek Mining District in central Colorado.
The successful completion of this research will provide a quick procedure for inventorying and initial characterization of noncoal mine waste materials, providing land management agencies with an increased ability to focus on the remediation of these sites.
Within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production, supply, and demand--providing timely, accurate, and unbiased estimates of global area, yield, and production.
The agency used satellite imagery, crop models, and remotely sensed weather data to support State Department assessments of food needs in the States of the former Soviet Union, particularly the drought-affected Ukraine.
The FAS also prepared detailed analyses of the performance of India's summer monsoon, frost damage to Brazil's coffee crop, and drought in Australia's eastern wheat regions.
Satellite-derived early warning of unusual crop conditions allowed for price adjustments in commodity markets and helped maximize United States farmers' returns.
In addition, the FAS used satellite imagery to monitor domestic crop production areas in support of work carried out by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (redesignated the Farm Service Agency in October 1994).
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) used remote sensing data in constructing area frame samples (using data from small sample areas as an aid to estimating crops and acreages), crop-specific land cover mapping, direct estimation of planted crop area, and assessment of crop conditions.
Products from the first three areas were mainly based on Landsat-5 TM and SPOT MultiSpectral Scanner data.
Crop condition assessment used data from the NOAA-11 satellite.
In 1994, NASS completed a California area frame for conducting 1994 surveys, New York and South Carolina frames for survey use in 1995, and it initiated work on a KS frame.
Among a host of other activities, NASS improved biweekly vegetative index map products for the 1994 crop season, based on NOAA-11 AVHRR data, and distributed them to NASS offices and USDA policy makers for their use.
Starting in the fall of 1993, NASS entered into a cooperative agreement with the Intertribal Agricultural Council to collect pilot-level data on Native American farm operator production.
One result of the agreement was a crop-specific land-cover map of the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations in Montana, delivered in September 1994.
Another satellite data application was the Delta Remote Sensing Project in Arizona.
It regressed multitemporal, computer-classified Landsat TM data against ground information to provide estimates with reduced sampling error for rice, cotton, and soybean acreage.
The resulting data provided county acreage estimates for the 1993 season in tabular form and in colored theme-map and tabular form.
NASS continued to produce biweekly vegetative index map products based on NOAA-11 AVHRR data during the 1994 crop season.
It distributed the maps to USDA decisionmakers and to various NASS state statistical offices to aid in assessments of crop conditions.
In 1994, NASS improved the maps in several ways, such as adding the capability to compare the current value with a meridian of several previous years.
However, due to the aging NOAA-11 satellite, on which one AVHRR ceased to function in September, and a relatively unstressed crop year, the 1994 maps contained less information than those of 1993 when the Midwest flood and the Southeast drought were featured in the maps.
The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) used remote sensing and GIS technologies to provide information about the extent and spatial dynamics of leafy spurge, a troublesome weed, in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, ND, among many other applications.
The results contributed to the development of a management plan for leafy spurge in the park and provided insight into the application of integrated spatial technologies for natural resource management.
Other uses of remote imaging together with data from the ground included maps of soil salinity, biomass, crop management, and crop yields.
For example, a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California, aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return, support efficient use of natural resources, and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment.
ARS researchers also developed fluorescence techniques and a prototype fluorescent instrument to discriminate and quantify crop residues.
The effective management of these remains from the harvest minimizes soil erosion and improves water quality.
In the area of hydrology, ARS scientists, in close cooperation with NASA and the Department of Commerce (DoC), used ground-based and remotely sensed data to aid in understanding how conditions in river basins influence climate and climate change.
ARS also is using space signals to help develop "precision farming systems" that permit land managers to adjust the treatment (with fertilizers, pesticides, or seeding rates) continuously across a field based on detailed local knowledge.
In 1994, the Forest Service (FS) used remote-sensing and associated technologies to assist in fighting fires throughout the Western United States as well as to detect high-risk fire zones, assess damage, monitor national and foreign ecosystems, and administer/manage more than 191 million acres of National Forest System lands and works.
The number of wildfires reached a record high in 1994, with more than 66,000 fires and over 3.8 million acres burned.
To combat these blazes, the FS employed airborne scanners, including Firefly developed by JPL, to help map and determine both speed and direction of the fires.
Throughout the year, the FS used such remote sensing technology as AVHRR imagery from NOAA satellites to implement early-warning measures.
Once fires started, the FS shifted to greater use of imagery from aircraft.
When fires had been suppressed, the FS employed satellite imagery to map and assess changes in the landscape caused by the fires.
Other uses for remote sensing included mapping, vegetation classification, the rehabilitation and restoration of ecosystems, research for global greenhouse gas emissions, land management, identification of critical wildlife habitat, support of law enforcement, and inventory programs.
The FS initiated partnerships with international, Federal, State, and private organizations for ecosystem assessment, leading to greater use of satellite data and increased understanding of global ecological processes.
For example, technical exchanges continued with Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and Kenya among other countries.
FS research and development of airborne video, digital cameras, radar, and GPS systems continued to address numerous ecosystem management applications.
Integration of remotely sensed data into GIS's proved to be cost effective in supporting land management decisions.
The Soil Conservation Service (redesignated the Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS in October 1994) adopted digital orthophotography as the common framework for collecting and managing natural resource geospatial databases.
The Service cooperated with other Federal and State agencies to acquire aerial photography and digital orthophotography.
In addition, it and other USDA agencies agreed with the DoD to purchase GPS units to collect georeferences for natural resource data to be included in a GIS.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), primarily through its Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada (EMSL-LV), with assistance from its Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC, also routinely conducted research and provided technical support using remote sensing as part of its overall environmental monitoring program.
The Agency used large-scale aerial photography to develop site characterization data during the remedial actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as to support site selection and monitoring at hazardous waste facilities operated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
It developed and used remote-sensing systems to support the provisions of the Clean Water Act.
In FY 1994, the EMSL-LV completed approximately 150 aerial-photographic site-characterization projects under CERCLA and RCRA, and satellite imagery played a part in helping engineers develop detailed site characterizations.
Aerial photography and satellite data also supported a broad variety of pollution, global change, pollution prevention, compliance, and other ecosystem monitoring studies in FY 1994, such as those of critical-habitat areas for wildlife.
In support of activities associated with the identification of the impacts and hazards resulting from severe flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in FY 1993, the EPA's Environmental Photographic Interpretation Center (EPIC--a branch of EMSL-LV) analyzed aerial photographs acquired, in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers, to identify flood impacts on industrial and agricultural facilities for assessment of hazardous and toxic waste movement and containment.
Additional analysis of pre- and postflood aerial photographs by EPIC in FY 1994 identified and mapped changes that have occurred at known waste disposal sites affected by the flooding.
M. Atmospheric studies NASA's and NOAA's efforts to monitor ozone depletion continued to reflect the effects of the Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991.
Data from NASA instruments such as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer aboard the Russian Meteor-3 satellite (launched in 1991) as well as NOAA instruments aboard balloons and the NOAA-9 satellite have enabled scientists to study the global cooling effects and loss of ozone that resulted from the eruption.
These are the first unambiguous, direct measurements of large-scale changes in the Earth's radiation budget caused by a volcanic eruption.
Ozone, a molecule made up of three atoms of oxygen, forms a thin layer of the atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.
The term "ozone hole" describes a large area of intense ozone depletion that occurs over Antarctica during late August through early October and typically breaks up in late November.
Scientists have determined that chlorine products from human activities, such as electronics manufacturing, air conditioning, and refrigeration, are a primary cause of ozone hole formation.
The Antarctic ozone levels for 1994 were nearly as small as the record lows from October 1993.
The slight recovery in 1994 probably resulted from fewer sulfuric acid particles remaining from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
The NSF's Office of Polar Programs continued during the year to support researchers studying the cause and effects of the Antarctic ozone hole at each of three year-round stations.
Both balloons for in situ measurements and remote sensing instruments were used.
There was a particularly strong effort during the late austral winter and early spring of 1994 to support the NASA-sponsored ER-2 aircraft flights from Christchurch, New Zealand, to study the ozone levels.
The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS--launched in 1991) continued, meanwhile, to make unprecedented measurements of global chlorine monoxide (ClO) concentration, observing the spatial relationships of ClO, ozone, temperature and other atmospheric variables.
These measurements provide the first global picture of the reactive form of chlorine that destroys ozone.
Even though regulations will phase out the production of chlorofluorocarbons in the future, the removal of chlorine from the stratosphere is a very slow process (taking decades or centuries), and stratospheric chlorine will continue to increase for at least the next few years, as chlorine already released into the lower atmosphere reaches the stratosphere.
The MLS is providing the only global monitoring of this process during the critical period in which stratospheric chlorine is increasing to record levels.
A major focus of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program (UARP) in 1994 was the Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment/Measurements for Assessing the Effect of Stratospheric Aircraft campaign.
The goal of this effort in the Pacific was to obtain in-situ measurements of atmospheric trace gases related to stratospheric ozone.
Full analysis of the data combined with model calculations will improve our understanding of the chemistry and processes of midlatitudes.
Scientists from NASA and NOAA contributed to the recently completed "Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1994," developed under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme.
This periodically issued report provides the scientific basis for policy decisions by parties to the Montreal Protocol (the international agreement limiting the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons) and its amendments.
NASA's ozone measurements are part of the Agency's MTPE program, which includes measurements from instruments on free-flying spacecraft and the Space Shuttle; aircraft, in situ, and ground-based observations; a comprehensive data and information system to process and distribute the findings; and a modeling effort designed to help understand, and eventually predict, the behavior of and changes in the Earth's system as well as to distinguish the effects of natural and human-induced global climatic change.
The first phase of MTPE includes the flight by NASA and partners of more than two dozen missions through 1998.
Data from MTPE and other global change research efforts will enable policymakers to formulate prudent policies regarding the future of the global environment.
The second phase of MTPE is the EOS program, a series of spacecraft planned to carry a variety of sophisticated instruments to make the most comprehensive measurements ever of the interrelated elements of the global environment.
NASA's program is part of the international Earth Observing System, in which satellites and instruments from the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada are being closely coordinated to provide complementary data on different aspects of the Earth's environment.
In support of NOAA's GOES program, NASA participated in the successful launch of the GOES-8 satellite in April 1994.
GOES-8 and subsequent GOES satellites (J-M) are the prime observational platforms for dynamic weather and the near-Earth environment for the 1990s and beyond.
In mid-1994, the EOS program was redesigned to respond to a reduction in program budget through the year 2000.
NASA's objectives were to preserve the scientific integrity of EOS as a global change program and to maintain the target launch schedule for core EOS missions.
Realigning the EOS program meant placing greater reliance on both domestic and foreign partners, in addition to deferring some data products and measurements.
However, some high-priority scientific items were added to the program or scheduled sooner, such as flight of an additional Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) instrument in the year 2000 and the incorporation of a Landsat-type instrument on the EOS AM-2 spacecraft (AM indicating a morning crossing time over the equator).
In September, NASA released a major solicitation seeking proposals for a "common" spacecraft bus for several of the subsequent EOS flights with selection expected in 1995.
Meanwhile, development continued on the EOSDIS, the means by which information from MTPE observations and analysis will be archived and made available to researchers and other worldwide users; NASA modified its planning for EOSDIS architecture, making it more extensible and accessible.
In August 1994, NASA released Version O, a working prototype for EOSDIS, designed for the general Earth science community for use in scientific research.
Pathfinders constitute a recent application of Earth-science and other data sets, developed specifically to study global environmental change.
They focus on processing, reprocessing, archiving, maintaining, and distributing existing data sets to make them more useful to researchers.
In FY 1994, the focus of the joint NASA-NOAA Pathfinder was on generating data for the benchmark period April 1987 to November 1988, but additional data sets included TOPEX/Poseidon, an educational CD-ROM, the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Regional experiment, and the UARS.
Using Pathfinder data sets, NASA scientists combined NOAA-7, -9, and -11 data on vegetation dating back to 1981 to predict the likelihood of famine and locust plagues in Africa, for use by the United States Agency for International Development to locate drought areas and locust swarms.
NASA also solicited broadened application of its scientific and technological assets via Internet.
A significant number of the resultant proposals and awards involved using the Internet to make environmental information more readily available for educational purposes.
The NSF also studied global change.
Under the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program, scientists at the University of Tennessee, Urbana, organized a campaign referred to as ALOHA-93 (Airborne Lidar and Observations of the Hawaiian Airglow).
Involving experimenters from several academic and commercial research institutions, its purpose was to study the source and dynamics of gravity waves over the mid-Pacific in October 1993.
Gravity waves are a major source of energy and momentum coupling between different layers of the atmosphere from the troposphere to the lower thermosphere.
In ALOHA-93, a sodium lidar, optical imager, and spectrometer gathered data from an aircraft, the flights being coordinated with selective overpasses of NASA's UARS (launched in 1991).
The campaign obtained important information on midocean storms and generation, propagation, and filtering of gravity waves in the mesosphere and stratosphere. This should lead to better parameterization of gravity waves in global circulation models.
The airborne observations also revealed rich horizontal structure in sporadic sodium layers observed in conjunction with substantial increases in mesopause temperature.
These metal layers, formed through meteoric ablation, appear to be sensitive to global atmospheric changes related to changing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane.
Also, the CEDAR program sponsored a special competition to encourage the development of innovative technical approaches, resulting in a number of projects to improve instrumentation and techniques.
The NSF has supported studies of how variations in the energy output from the Sun and anthropogenic effects contribute variously to global change.
The SunRISE (Radiative Inputs of the Sun to Earth) program supports the development and deployment of a precision photometric telescope designed for measurements of sunspots, faculae, and other features thought to be sources of variations in solar brightness.
The program also supports measurements of the solar diameter and analysis of the historical measurements of the plage phenomena (bright, granular areas in the chromosphere of the Sun), which are possible indicators of changes in radiance.
A second area of emphasis in the last year has been space weather, conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere that can significantly influence the performance and integrity of important space-borne and ground-based technological systems.
The NSF supported a study conducted by scientists at Johns Hopkins University in which they used data from a Swedish satellite to predict electrical currents induced in a power grid at Chalk Point, MD; they successfully correlated intense electrical currents in the ionosphere with the induced currents on the ground.
Other studies of ionospheric currents used magnetometer arrays deployed by scientists from Boston College, Augsburg College, and the University of Michigan.
The scientists will use data from these newly created arrays in Canada and Greenland to study dynamic variations in ionospheric currents that originate from the entry of energetic particles from the Sun into Earth's atmosphere.
Another atmospheric and environmental concern in recent years has been global warming.
In the first international, interdisciplinary effort to discuss this issue broadly, 37 scientists from 10 countries met near the beginning of the fiscal year at a conference sponsored by DoE and NOAA.
Among the findings of the conference were that while the global average temperature has been rising in recent decades, the warming has not been truly global and has occurred mainly at night.
Scientists believe that the cause of higher nighttime temperatures may be the combined result of an increase in greenhouse gases and cloud cover over continents combined with increased sulfur emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels.
A climatic model developed by James Hansen of NASA that took all three factors into account came closer to simulating observed temperature changes than had previous models.
While nighttime warming may lengthen the growing season and reduce killing frosts, it might increase insect infestations, reduce crop-growing areas, and raise heat-related death rates among humans.
In a study relevant to this issue, NIST has been studying isotropic measurements for NASA to identify and quantify the presence of tropospheric methane (CH4), which is second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) in its effects on global warming.
Although the tropospheric CH4 concentration is a small fraction (5 percent) of that of CO2, CH4 accounts for about 12 percent of the global temperature rise, due to strong absorption in a relatively transparent part of the infrared.
Intensive CH4 measurement and modeling is underway because of significant uncertainties in both anthropogenic and natural emission data that are critical for estimating the global CH4 budget.
To serve these needs, NIST has compiled a data base of global source and ambient isotropic measurements.
N. Oceanographic studies
TOPEX/Poseidon, a satellite jointly sponsored by the French Space Agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), and NASA (launched in August 1992) continued to provide valuable information during 1994.
The satellite uses a radar altimeter to yield precise measurements of sea-surface height.
Data analysis shows the seasonal change in sea level in the Northern Hemisphere is about 50 percent larger than in the southern half of the globe.
This was a previously unknown asymmetry and indicates the air-sea heat exchange is much stronger in the Northern Hemisphere.
Data from the satellite have also enabled scientists to track disturbances caused by the lingering effects of the El Ni√±o event of 1991-93, the longest one in the last 40 years.
El Ni√±o is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions, including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States, and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia.
Observations made by TOPEX/Poseidon in the North Pacific revealed a northward shift of the Kuroshio, the swift current southeast of Japan, which has been traced back to the El Ni√±o event of 1982-83.
Meteorologists believe that the position of the Kuroshio is drastically affecting the weather of North America.
NASA, CNES, and NOAA held discussions in 1994 on a TOPEX/Poseidon Follow-On (TPFO) mission, in which NOAA, the new partner, would provide the ground segment.
TPFO would meet both operational and research needs.
NASA also participated in the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA)-Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) program.
Measurements from NASA's ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft have produced significant improvements in our understanding of precipitation, convection, clouds and radiation, air-sea interaction and oceanographic processes.
Results from the 1993 TOGA-COARE field exercise in oceanography and long-term atmospheric effects will be presented in Melbourne, Australia, in April 1995.
Meanwhile, the NIST Radiometric Physics Division has been continuing its collaboration with the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) project and associated investigators.
SeaWiFS, scheduled for launch in 1995, is designed to provide global observations of photosynthetic pigment concentrations contained in the microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton.
Among other things, these measurements will help to assess how much carbon dioxide transferred to the ocean from the atmosphere is being transformed into oceanic plant biomass.
Accurate calibration of the SeaWiFS instrument is critical to the mission's success.
Also, sea-based optical measurements for validation of the post-launch calibration and various products derived from the satellite observations must be equally accurate.
NIST's role is to help ensure that these observations are traceable to radiometric standards and that instrument calibrations are performed properly.
NIST has designed, constructed, and characterized a portable, multichannel spectroradiometer (SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer or SXR) to compare the calibrations of field instruments and to check the calibration sources at different institutions.
The device was used during the second and third SeaWiFS Round Robins in June 1993 and September 1994.
NIST also used the device during a NASA/NOAA field experiment in February 1994 at the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) support facility in Hawaii.
MOBY will be used to verify the postlaunch SeaWiFS calibration and other future ocean color satellite instruments to be launched later in this decade under the EOS program.
Near the end of the fiscal year, NOAA announced completion of initial flight tests of a new system for mapping coastal ocean salinity.
Called the scanning low-frequency microwave radiometer, the new system is smaller than older ones and can be operated from small, single-engine aircraft rather than the four-engine C-130.
Consisting of a microwave radiometer, an infrared radiometer, a GPS instrument for locating measurements, and a computer, the new system can produce salinity maps at the rate of 100 square kilometers per hour.
NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) anticipated collaborating with other NOAA and Federal agencies and academia in coastal-ecosystem health, hydrological, and coastal forecasting activities where data on salinity are critical, such as in studies of the distribution of brown shrimp in the Mississippi Delta and Gulf of Mexico.
Additionally, NOAA/NESDIS's Office of Satellite Data Products and Distribution forged a partnership with NASA for the development and joint funding of a United States ground system to support real-time collection of high-priority scatterometer and ocean color data from the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, scheduled for launch in 1996.

1. Canadian Space Programme
The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and other Canadian government departments and agencies involved in space are continuing efforts to implement the new Canadian Space Programme (CSP) announced in 1994.
In all sectors, work in progress to define and implement programmes in priority areas for Canada in the fields of human space flight, Earth observation, satellite communications, space science and space technology development.
Activities undertaken by Canada in those areas guarantee a Canadian contribution to the global knowledge base and help to achieve socio-economic benefits for all Canadians.
In order to better accomplish those ends, the President of CSA has recently begun a process of reorganizing the Agency.
The reorganization process has involved extensive consultation with the employees of CSA and all the major Canadian stakeholders in space activities.
The objectives of the reorganization are to produce an organizational structure that better fulfils the mandate of CSA, makes better use of the skills of its employees, responds more effectively to a changing environment, and plans better for the future.
The major orientations and objectives of CSP remain as follows:
(a) To focus on the commercial and technological strengths of Canada to meet its ongoing needs in space science, automation and robotics, Earth observation and communications;
(b) To promote economic growth and employment;
(c) To enhance Canadian industrial competitiveness and export capability;
(d) To foster the advancement of knowledge.
Like all federal government programmes, CSP underwent budgetary reductions in early 1995.
Funding for the Second Long-term Space Plan for the period from 1994/95 to 2003/04, approved in June 1994, was reduced by 15 per cent in the budget provisions of February 1995.
The guiding principles to be observed in carrying out the reductions in Canadian space activities are fivefold: first, that space remains a key priority of the Government of Canada, despite the reductions; second, that the reductions are to be achieved while preserving the funding balance between the major components of CSP identified in June 1994; third, that Canada will meet its commitments to its international partners on the International Space Station Alpha; and fourth, that the timetable for implementing the Second Long-term Space Plan will not be significantly affected.
(a) Some Canadian accomplishments in space in 1995
The most significant event of 1995 was the launch of RADARSAT-I, the first Canadian Earth observation satellite, on 4 November 1995.
RADARSAT-I will use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to observe the Earth, even in darkness and through clouds, providing data essential to a variety of applications for resource management and environmental monitoring.
Work will soon start on the follow-up satellite, RADARSAT-II, which will be ready for launch around the year 2000.
Canadian astronaut C. Hadfield took part in the Shuttle Mission STS-74 that docked with the MIR station of the Russian Federation, and operated the Canadarm system used to put into place the docking adaptor that will allow repeated shuttle missions to MIR.
C. Hadfield was the first Canadian to orbit in a spacecraft of the Russian Federation and the first Canadian mission specialist.
In the area of space science and research into global change, Canada is continuing to develop the instrument called Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere, its contribution to the Earth Observing System of the United States of America, destined for launch on a polar platform in 1998.
This mission, developed in collaboration with scientists of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States, will measure the amount of carbon monoxide and methane in the Earth atmosphere in order to determine the effects of human activity on the atmospheric environment of the planet.
CSA, in collaboration with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES) (the French National Centre for Space Studies), has recently made important discoveries with the Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII).
Data from this instrument show planetary scale disturbances in upper atmospheric weather corresponding to one or two waves around the globe.
These disturbances resemble weather patterns, but clearly demonstrate that the upper atmosphere responds to processes arising at the surface of the Earth.
WINDII also discovered a gap in atomic oxygen at the equator, thought to be due to the action of atmospheric tides and associated winds.
Canadian scientists participated with scientists from France, Germany, Japan, the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA in the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission launched in July 1995.
Approximately 80 studies were conducted on the effects produced by microgravity on astronauts, including back pain and changes in nerve conduction and in the cardiovascular system.
Canada recently became a partner in a multinational cooperative endeavour to support research into semiconductor and oxide materials using the floating zone process.
The Commercial Float Zone Furnace will fly on the SPACELAB 04 mission to process 12 sample materials being investigated by researchers from Canada, Germany and the United States.
Also important is the ongoing COSPAS-SARSAT programme (the International Satellite System for Search and Rescue), of which Canada is one of the four original member States along with France, Russian Federation and the United States.
The System currently features 6 satellites, 28 ground stations and 15 control centres in 16 countries.
To date it has saved 4,535 lives.
Canada is continuing work on the development of the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), its contribution to the largest international science project in history, the International Space Station Alpha.
(b) Key events in the Canadian Space Programme in 1996
This project is a cooperative venture involving Canadian and United States partners in the private sector, and will provide voice, data transmission and paging services to users.
Also important in 1996 will be the activities of three Canadian astronauts.
D. Williams was selected by NASA as part of the 1994 class of mission specialist trainees.
Dr. B. Thirsk was also selected as a payload specialist for space shuttle flight STS-78, following a rigorous international selection process involving astronauts from several countries.
STS-78 will be a Life and Microgravity Sciences Space Lab Mission.
To complete the group, M. Garneau, the first Canadian astronaut in space, was selected for a second space shuttle mission.
M. Garneau will fly as a mission specialist aboard Endeavour flight STS-77, on a nine-day mission scheduled for April 1996.
Finally, work is in progress on the definition of two small scientific missions, as well as on the collaboration between Government and industry in the Advanced SatCom and the International Mobile Research programmes.
2. Space activities that were or could be the subject of greater cooperation,
with particular emphasis on the needs of developing countries
In June 1994, the Government of Canada approved the new CSP, which calls for investments of 2.4 billion Canadian dollars over 10 years, and is the result of over two years of intensive consultations between CSA and all stakeholders in Canada.
The new CSP calls for investments in several sectors, in particular the following:
(a) Earth observation (completion of RADARSAT I, initiation of RADARSAT II, advanced radar technology development, ground segment upgrades, applications development and technology transfer);
(b) Satellite communications (launch of MSAT, a programme for advanced satellite communications development, a programme for development of technologies for mobile communications);
(c) Space science (activities in solar-terrestrial physics, atmospheric sciences, astronomy and microgravity life and materials sciences, a space science enhancement programme and the possibility of two small satellites for science missions);
(d) Space technology (ongoing in-house projects and contracting out development, a new strategic space technology development programme, and contributions to new ESA programmes);
(e) Flights for Canadian astronauts (opportunities on the United States space shuttle and preparation of related experiments);
(f) A new space awareness programme to encourage Canadian youth to undertake careers in science and technology.
Also in June 1994, the Government announced that, following the successful conclusion of discussions with NASA, Canada would remain a full partner in the context of the International Space Station project, albeit at a reduced cost.
The new CSP also mentions that space activities are of strategic importance to the transition of Canada to a knowledge-based economy, and identifies CSA as the lead coordinator for all policies and programmes of the Government in civil space-related research, science and technology, industrial development and international cooperation.
Cooperation is essential to the implementation of CSP, as it promotes the sharing of costs and risk in carrying out programmes and activities.
The time for cooperation has never been so good, with the new opportunities resulting from such major events as the end of the cold war and the increased realization around the globe of the important uses of space technologies, systems and science for sustainable development.
Clearly, issues affecting the common welfare call for common solutions, and international space cooperation therefore becomes a chosen instrument.
In that context, and also because most Canadian space activities have always been undertaken in collaboration with foreign partners, it is expected that significant opportunities for enhanced international cooperation will arise in the future, especially in the context of the new CSP.
The possibilities for cooperation are expected to be found in most of the sectors identified above in the description of the new CSP, and more specifically in space science research (including microgravity research), space technology development, radar technology and systems development and applications of RADARSAT data and of communications satellites.
Several of the opportunities for cooperation could be very helpful in furthering the process of sustainable development, where possible.
In particular, Canada (mainly through the efforts of the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing and the Canadian International Development Agency) has been working closely with developing countries in all regions in addressing the potential uses of RADARSAT data for a variety of applications, such as geology and geomorphology, the identification and monitoring of primary forest clearing for agricultural land use, ice monitoring, the monitoring of changes in shorelines and mangrove forests, hydrology, soil erosion and disaster monitoring.
Technical training and data analysis workshops have been held, assistance in the provision of relevant equipment has been provided, and other such opportunities could be considered.
Furthermore, there could be interesting opportunities in the use of satellite communications services for tele-education and telemedicine, as well as for research into global change.
In the latter case, such cooperation could be facilitated on the American continent through the new Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research.
CSA and its partners in the implementation of CSP would welcome any suggestions from existing or potential new partners regarding possibilities for increased cooperation. B. India
1. Space activities
In 1995, as in past years, India continued to make significant progress in the development and application of space technology to promote rapid socio-economic development.
The Indian space programme also continued to further international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space.
(a) Performance of INSAT
The two Indian-built multi-purpose satellites, INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B, respectively launched in July 1992 and July 1993, together with INSAT-1D, launched in 1990, provided uninterrupted services in the areas of telecommunication, television broadcasting, meteorology, disaster warning and distress alerts.
Development and fabrication of more advanced satellites in the INSAT-2 series, in particular INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D, have made good progress.
INSAT-2C, which was successfully launched on 6 December 1995, will provide additional services, including mobile and business communications.
INSAT-2D, identical to INSAT-2C is to be launched in 1996.
INSAT-2E, with advanced meteorological payloads in addition to communication payloads, is also being developed.
A few transponders on board INSAT-2E will be made available to INTELSAT.
The launch of INSAT-2E is planned for 1997 or 1998.
New demonstrations and experiments designed to extend and enhance the INSAT services for various purposes, especially for new classes of telecommunication services and tele-education, are being conducted.
Several experiments and demonstrations involving satellite-based communication for interactive education and training have been successfully conducted for universities, village administration (panchayat raj) officials, special social groups and personnel from the industrial and commercial sector.
A channel of INSAT is exclusively used for interactive training and education.
This channel can be used for intensive, interactive training courses of long duration for special interest groups, without the usual constraints on the length and timing of the broadcast.
(b) IRS satellites for natural resource management
The two Indian remote sensing satellites, IRS-1A and IRS-1B, respectively launched in March 1988 and August 1991, together with IRS-P2, launched by India with its own polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV), known as PSLV-D2, in October 1994, have become the mainstays of the national system for the management of natural resources.
The data from the IRS satellites are being put to use in important applications such as estimating agricultural crop acreage and yield, drought monitoring and assessment, flood mapping, land-use and land-cover mapping, wasteland management, survey and management of ocean and marine resources and of forest resources, urban planning and mineral prospecting.
Satellite-based remote sensing services, will be further enhanced through the launch of more advanced satellites, IRS-1C and IRS-1D, currently being developed.
These satellites will have better spatial and spectral resolutions than the present IRS satellites, stereo viewing capability and on-board recording facilities.
The launch of IRS-1C is planned for the first quarter of 1996.
India has planned the launch of an IRS-P series of satellites on board its PSLV launch vehicle.
The series would be designed to test and demonstrate new and advanced technologies and applications of space-based remote sensing such as those for ocean resources monitoring and cartography.
India will provide opportunities for flying payloads from other countries on the IRS-P series of satellites.
(c) Integrated mission on sustainable development
Action plans for the development of other areas in 174 districts all over the country, identified under IMSD, are being generated.
Priority has been given to 92 specific areas for generating action plans for integrated land and water resources development using IRS data.
The initial results of implementing the action plans generated under IMSD have been encouraging.
For example, in Ananthapur district in southern India, construction of water-harvesting structures have resulted in a substantial rise in the ground-water levels, enabling farmers there to grow two crops per year, a commendable achievement for an area with the second-lowest rainfall in the country.
(d) Launch vehicle technology
PSLV-D2 placed the Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-P2, weighing 804 kilograms, into a polar sun-synchronous orbit at a height of about 817 kilometres.
The third developmental launch of PSLV (PSLV-D3) is planned for the first quarter of 1996.
The Government of India has already approved the launch of three more continuation flights, PSLV-C1, PSLV-C2 and PSLV-C3, over the next three years.
Those flights will be used to prove the reliability of PSLV, to increase its payload capability towards operationalization of the vehicle, and to launch satellites for Earth observation and scientific missions.
PSLV has also proved, in flight, many of the systems that go into the Indian geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV), intended for launching the Indian INSAT class of communication satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit.
Development of GSLV is progressing well.
As a result of the suspension of transfer of cryogenic technology by Glavkosmos of the Russian Federation, India is developing its own cryogenic stage.
The first few flights of GSLV will, however, use the cryogenic stage supplied by Glavkosmos.
(e) Pursuits in space science
India continues to pursue research in space science.
The SROSS-C2 satellite, put into orbit using the Indian launch vehicle ASLV-D4, on 4 May 1994, is providing valuable scientific data in astronomy and aeronomy from its two payloads, one for conducting the gamma ray burst experiment and the other consisting of a Retarding Potential Analyser (RPA).
Several gamma ray bursts of potential celestial origin have been detected in the energy range of 20 to 3,000 kilo-electron-volts.
RPA has so far collected a few hundred sets of useful orbital ionospheric data over the Indian subcontinent, and interesting observations on the variation of electron and ion temperatures have been made.
The National Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar Facility set up near Tirupati in southern India is helping atmospheric researchers.
The facility is also being used by international scientists to conduct experiments.
2. International cooperation
India continues to pursue cooperation in space with several countries.
Recent agreements include those signed with the Russian Federation on 30 June 1994 and with Ukraine on 16 September 1994.
India is to serve as host to a Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the Asia-Pacific region, which is being established as a United Nations initiative.
Under the sharing of experience in space (SHARES) programme, several participants, specifically from developing countries, are being trained in the various aspects of space science and applications.
India is also playing an active role in the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites.
Data from IRS-1B and IRS-P2 are now available to users all over the world.
3. Conclusion
With the satellites designed and built by India in the INSAT and IRS series performing to specification, the country has started to reap the benefits of space technology for developmental applications, specifically in the areas of communication, broadcasting, meteorology, disaster management and the survey and management of resources.
The planned launches of more powerful satellites in the two series will further enhance and extend the benefits of space technology.
The successful launch of PSLV and the progress made in the development of GSLV have inspired confidence in the capability of India to launch the IRS and INSAT class of satellites from its own soil.
Thus, India today has a well-integrated and self-supporting space programme which is providing important services to society. C. Jamaica
Jamaica reports that it has not yet established a national space programme.
D. Japan 1. National organizations for space activities
(a) Space Activities Commission
The Space Activities Commission (SAC) was established within the Office of the Prime Minister in 1968 under the Law for the Establishment of the Space Activities Commission as the body to succeed to, and carry on the work of, the National Space Activities Council, which had been functioning since 1960. Its purpose was to unify the space activities of various government agencies and actively promote them.
SAC formulates plans, deliberates and takes decisions on the matters listed below, and submits its opinions to the Prime Minister, whose decision is guided by the opinion of SAC thus submitted.
The matters dealt with by SAC are as follows:
(a) Important policy matters relating to space activities;
(b) Important matters bearing on the coordination of space-related work among the government agencies concerned;
(c) Estimates of space activity expenses of the government agencies concerned;
(d) Matters relating to the development and training of space researchers and engineers (excluding instruction and research at universities or colleges);
(e) Other important matters concerning space activities.
SAC consists of five persons noted for their learning, nominated by the Prime Minister following approval by the Diet, and including the Minister of State for Science and Technology serving as Chairman.
Its secretariat functions are performed by the Space Policy Division of the Research and Development Bureau of the Science and Technology Agency (STA).
(b) Science and Technology Agency
STA established the Space Science and Technology Preparation Office in May 1960, thereby starting space activities for the first time through an organization of the Government of Japan.
In July 1964, STA set up the National Space Development Centre to serve as the primary promoter of space activities in Japan.
Attracting able personnel from industry, the academic world and Government and maintaining flexible budgetary and organizational procedures and mechanisms are necessary to ensure the full and effective implementation of space activities.
To that end, STA reorganized the National Space Development Centre into the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, a special entity under the law, in operation since 1969.
STA now plans and promotes basic space-related policy and the overall coordination of space activities among government agencies, and conducts research and development activities through the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), a research organization attached to it, and NASDA.
It thereby plays the central role in the space activities of Japan.
As the secretariat of SAC, STA also maintains liaison and conducts negotiations between various government agencies, thereby allowing smooth and effective development and utilization of space science and technology.
(c) National Aerospace Laboratory
NAL, formerly called the National Aeronautical Laboratory, was established in July 1955 as a subsidiary organization of the Office of the Prime Minister to expedite the development of aeronautical technology in Japan.
After the establishment of STA in 1956, NAL was placed under its administration.
In 1963, NAL was charged with the additional task of conducting research in space technology and renamed National Aerospace Laboratory.
NAL established its Rocket Division in 1963 and its Kakuda Research Centre in 1966 to allow research on a broader scale.
The Rocket Division was reorganized into the Space Technology Research Group in October 1969 to encourage progress in space research within a stronger, more fully structured organization.
Since then, the Space Technology Research Group and the Kakuda Research Centre have played a dominant role in the development of space technology in NAL, although close cooperation with other divisions is occasionally required.
Most NAL divisions are conducting research on key technologies for winged systems of space transport, which NAL considers essential to the pursuit of autonomous space activities by Japan in the coming century.
NAL has strong connections with NASDA, with which it jointly conducts various experiments required for the development of space technology.
The liquid oxygen turbopump developed at the Kakuda Research Centre is installed in the LE-7 engine.
The principal activities of NAL in the field of space technology are as follows:
(a) Research on basic technologies for spaceplanes, with the focus on aerodynamics, advanced composite structures, flight control, propulsion systems, manned space flight and orbiter manoeuvring engines;
(b) Joint research with NASDA on the aerodynamics, guidance and control, and structure of the H-II Orbiting Plane (HOPE);
(c) Research on oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine components;
(d) Research on satellite systems and utilization of the space environment.
(d) National Space Development Agency of Japan
NASDA was established by law in October 1969 as the central body responsible for the development of space technology in Japan and the promotion of space activities solely for peaceful purposes.
The main tasks of NASDA are to develop satellites and their launching vehicles; to launch and track the satellites and promote the utilization of space technology; and to devise methods, facilities and organizations for those purposes in accordance with the Space Development Programme.
To perform its tasks, NASDA has facilities in various parts of the country.
NASDA has orbited various satellites by means of N-I, N-II, H-I and H-II launch vehicles. It has launched a total of seven satellites with the N-I vehicle, the first, the Engineering Test Satellite I (ETS-I), in September 1975.
Since 1981, eight meteorological, telecommunications and broadcasting satellites have been launched with the N-II, and the H-I made a record 9 successful launches after its maiden flight in 1986.
To meet the demand for launching large-scale satellites in the 1990s, NASDA developed the H-II launch vehicle with 100 per cent Japanese technology, and its first flight was successfully made in February 1994.
NASDA is also striving, from a long-range, system-based perspective, to promote research and development in materials processing through test projects, and to implement the space station programme involving the United States Space Shuttle, thereby further expanding the scope of space activities in Japan.
(i) Tanegashima Space Centre
The Tanegashima Space Centre has a total land area of 8.6 million square metres. The site has launch pads for H-II, J-1 and TR-IA rockets, communication and test facilities and optical and radio wave systems.
There are also ground combustion test facilities for checking the reliability of liquid-propelled rocket engines and their parts as well as their performance within the launch site.
To track and support the rockets launched, two radar stations are located on Tanegashima Island.
(ii) Yoshinobu Launch Complex
The Yoshinobu Launch Complex for launching the H-II launch vehicle was completed in September 1991.
Major facilities and equipment include a vehicle assembly building, a mobile launcher, a pad service tower, propellant storage and supply facilities, a launch control building (blockhouse) and a range control centre.
Static firing tests of the first-stage rocket engine of the H-II are conducted adjacent to the Yoshinobu Launch Complex.
Storage and supply facilities (for liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, helium and nitrogen) and facilities to supply water and electricity are designed for common use by the Complex and adjacent installations.
(iii) Tsukuba Space Centre
Furnished with up-to-date test facilities and equipment comparable to those of major laboratories throughout the world, it conducts research and development in space technology and engineering tests of satellites and launch vehicles.
It also plays an important role as the nucleus for tracking and control of satellites in Japan.
A large-capacity computing system facilitates various types of analyses and real-time data processing during launch and initial orbit phases.
Other roles of the Centre include collecting and maintaining data on developments in space technology, as well as providing training and education and implementing joint studies with other organizations.
(iv) Kakuda Propulsion Centre
The Kakuda Propulsion Centre is responsible for research on and development of constituent parts of rockets.
(v) Earth Observation Centre
The Earth Observation Centre receives and processes remote sensing data by means of satellites. It now receives and processes data from the Marine Observation Satellites 1 and 1b (MOS-1/1b) of Japan, the United States Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT), the satellite syst√®me probatoire d'observation de la terre (SPOT) (the French remote sensing satellite), the European Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (ERS-1) and the Japanese Earth Resource Satellite (JERS-1).
(e) Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
Directly under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture is the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), a central institute for space and astronautical science in Japan.
ISAS conducts scientific research using space vehicles.
For this purpose, it develops and operates sounding rockets, satellite launchers, scientific satellites, planetary probes and scientific balloons.
As of February 1995, 21 scientific and test spacecraft had been launched, including Suisei and Sakigake, which explored Halley's comet in 1986.
ISAS was founded in April 1981 as a result of the reorganization of the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, University of Tokyo, which was the core of space research in Japan from 1964 to 1981. It launched the first Japanese satellite Ohsumi in 1970.
As one of the inter-university research institutes run with the cooperation of researchers in universities, ISAS takes part in graduate education. Some of its students are from the University of Tokyo, where a number of ISAS faculty members have positions as professors or associate professors.
Other students from various universities receive part of their education at ISAS by working under the guidance of ISAS staff.
The main ISAS campus is at Sagamihara, about 20 kilometres west of metropolitan Tokyo. Several ISAS centres are set up around the country.
(i) Kagoshima Space Centre
The Kagoshima Space Centre (KSC) is located in a mostly hilly area of Uchinoura-cho, on the east coast of Ohsumi Peninsula, Kagoshima Prefecture. Covering a total of 71 hectares, the area of KSC includes various facilities for launching rockets, telemetry and tracking, command stations for rockets and satellites and optical observation posts, at sites developed by flattening the tops of several hills.
Buildings in KSC have a total floor space of 12,755 square metres.
Between 1962, when the use of KSC began, and February 1994, a total of 336 rockets (24 Mu, 25 Lambda, 119 Kappa and 172 S and test rockets) were launched.
(ii) Noshiro Testing Centre
The Noshiro Testing Centre (NTC) was established in 1962 at Asanai Beach, Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture. The ground firing test stand, workshop, measurement centre, optical observatory and other facilities are provided for ground-based test firing of large-scale solid motors.
Basic research on liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen engines was started in 1975, and several research facilities have been constructed.
ISAS, which began studies on the development of the air turboramjet engine in 1976, tested the engine at NTC from 1990 to 1992 under sea-level static conditions using a quarter-scale model.
(iii) Usuda Deep Space Centre
Surrounded by mountains that block out city noise, the Usuda Deep Space Centre is located 1,450 metres above sea level at Usuda-machi, Nagano Prefecture.
It started operating in October 1984. A large parabolic antenna 64 metres in diameter, a receiver, a transmitter and a ranging system in S-band are provided at the Centre to serve as a deep space tracking, telemetry and command station.
The facilities can be controlled by the Deep Space Operation Centre at the ISAS main campus at Sagamihara, Kanagawa.
(iv) Sanriku Balloon Centre
The Sanriku Balloon Centre is located at Sanriku-cho, on the east coast of Iwate Prefecture, facing the Pacific Ocean.
The balloon launch site is on a hill 230 metres above sea level. The control centre stands beside the launch site, where launch control and assembly of the balloon and its payload are conducted.
On a hill about 700 metres south-west of the launch site is the telemetry centre, where balloon tracking, telemetry receiving and telecommanding are conducted.
In May 1987, a new telemetry centre was constructed at the top of Mount Ohkubo, 4.1 kilometres west of the launch site.
(v) Collaboration of ISAS and NASA in space experiments with particle accelerators and Geotail
ISAS conducted space experiments with particle accelerator (SEPAC) jointly with NASA in 1983 and 1992.
In SEPAC, accelerated ion and electron beams were ejected from the space shuttle.
In 1992, the Geotail satellite developed by ISAS was launched by NASA using a Delta II launch vehicle.
The Geotail satellite carries scientific instruments developed by both ISAS and NASA.
(f) Ministry of Transport
The space-related organizations under the Ministry of Transport are the Transport Policy Bureau acting as a headquarters, the Electronic Navigation Research Institute as a subsidiary organization, and the Maritime Safety Agency and the Japan Meteorological Agency as affiliated agencies.
Those bodies have been using meteorological, geodetic and aeronautical satellites, and accumulating knowledge about their use.
Recently, the importance of space technology and its use in the field of transport has increased, as reflected in such areas as meteorological and maritime observation, maritime geodetic control, search and rescue of ships and aircraft, air traffic control and operational control of ships, aircraft and land vehicles.
In addition, space technology, such as large-scale geostationary satellite technology, has been steadily progressing.
It is now believed that it would be much more economical and effective to launch a large, multi-purpose satellite instead of launching several kinds of satellites separately in order to conduct meteorological observations and air traffic control.
As a result, the Ministry of Transport has been investigating the possibility of establishing a multi-purpose satellite system to cover all its needs.
The Ministry plans to conduct a search and rescue experiment to relay ship distress signals using the geostationary meteorological satellite-5 (GMS-5), launched in March 1995.
The Ministry also supervises NASDA, a quasi-governmental agency, thus exercising control over satellite development.
Important projects under way include the following:
(a) The Electronic Navigation Research Institute is conducting research and development work on satellite-based technologies for air navigation and air traffic control.
Major research and development projects undertaken in those areas are as follows: automatic dependence surveillance, a system that gives pseudo-radar images to air traffic controllers by using aircraft-derived position data transmitted through a satellite data link; and the wide area augmentation system, a system that improves the integrity, accuracy and availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for civil aviation in Japan;
(b) Development of a GPS overlay, a system that recovers the accuracy degradation of the GPS system by using GPS signals transmitted by a geostationary satellite;
(c) Development of a satellite data link, a system that improves the communication quality and surveillance capability of air traffic control for the safety of transoceanic flights.
(i) Maritime Safety Agency
To establish Japanese territorial waters, the positions of the mainland and the off-lying islands must be registered with the World Geodetic System (WGS).
The Maritime Safety Agency has therefore been participating in a joint international observation plan using the United States laser geodynamics satellite (LAGEOS) since 1982 to fix the precise positions of the mainland based on WGS.
The Agency has been conducting a maritime geodetic survey to determine, to a high degree of accuracy, the positions of the mainland and its off-lying islands and the distances between them, using the geodetic satellite of Japan, AJISAI, launched in August 1986.
(ii) Japan Meteorological Agency
The Japan Meteorological Agency conducts space-based meteorological observations using GMS and meteorological rockets as part of the World Weather Watch programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
GMS observes cloud coverage and temperatures of sea surface and cloud top, and collects meteorological data from aircraft, buoys and meteorological observation stations in remote areas.
It also distributes by facsimile the cloud image charts thus obtained.
As the ground facility to operate GMS, the Agency has the Meteorological Satellite Centre, which comprises the Data Processing Centre for image data processing and the Command and Data Acquisition Station for communication between the Data Processing Centre and GMS.
The satellite data serve to improve weather forecasting on an operational basis, and are used in the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) of WMO.
In addition, the Data Processing Centre receives and analyses data from the polar-orbiting meteorological satellites of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The meteorological rockets observe temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind etc. at altitudes of between 30 and 60 kilometres.
Launching of the meteorological rockets are carried out by the Meteorological Rocket Observation Station, the sole facility capable of meteorological rocket observation in East Asia and the western Pacific.
The Meteorological Research Institute develops techniques for the more effective use of meteorological satellite data, and conducts studies on sensors for the next generation of meteorological satellites.
(g) Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications plans and promotes policies governing the use of radio waves and space-related research and development in the same field.
The Communications Research Laboratory is attached to the Ministry, which also supervises Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK), NASDA, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and the Telecommunications Advancement Organization (TAO) of Japan.
The main activities of the Ministry include research on and development of long-range space communication concepts, complex satellite systems and a pilot plan for promoting satellite utilization and advanced satellite communication systems.
(i) Communications Research Laboratory
The Communications Research Laboratory is conducting research and development work on various kinds of space technologies to meet diversified communications needs in an era of advanced information technology and manned space flight.
Specific activities of the Laboratory include the following:
(a) Research on and development of small, low Earth-orbiting satellite communication systems;
(b) Research on cluster satellite communications;
(c) Research on and development of intersatellite communications with S-band, millimetre-wave and optical frequencies using ETS-VI;
(d) Research on and development of advanced mobile satellite communications using Ka-band and millimetre-wave and advanced satellite broadcasting using the communications and broadcasting technology satellite (COMETS);

(j) Experiments for the precise measurement of crustal movement and rotation of the Earth using the very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) and satellite laser ranging systems.
(ii) Telecommunications Advancement Organization of Japan
The Telecommunications Satellite Corporation of Japan was renewed as TAO in 1992.
The Corporation was established in 1979 to develop radio communications and seek effective utilization of radio waves in space by controlling the location, attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites and efficiently using the telecommunications facilities installed on those satellites.
The main tasks of TAO are as follows:
(a) Controlling the location, attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites;
(b) Ensuring that radio systems on communications and broadcasting satellites are used by operators of radio stations.
The Kimitsu Satellite Control Centre tracks and controls satellites.
CS-3, N-STAR, and BS-3 are currently tracked and controlled using six antennas (in the 10 to 18 diameter class).
To promote the spread of high-vision satellite broadcasting (high-definition television), TAO owns one of the transponders aboard BS-3b, and leases it to NHK and commercial broadcasting companies.
(h) Other organizations
In addition to the above-mentioned organizations, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the National Police Agency, the Geographical Survey Institute of the Ministry of Construction and the Fire Defence Agency of the Ministry of Home Affairs have made space-related budgetary appropriations.
2. Development of Space Science and Technology in Japan
(a) Lunar and planetary exploration
(i) LUNAR-A Project (Moon Penetrator Mission)
ISAS plans to send a spacecraft called LUNAR-A to the Moon in 1997.
It will be the second flight of the M-V vehicle being developed by ISAS.
LUNAR-A will drop three penetrators into the Moon.
The penetrators are supposed to penetrate the lunar surface, and form a network that will explore the internal structure of the Moon using on-board seismometers and heat flow meters.
(ii) PLANET-B Project (Mars Atmosphere/Plasma Mission)
PLANET-B is the first Japanese Mars mission and is scheduled for launch in 1998 by the M-V-3 vehicle.
It will be injected into orbit around Mars, and will study the Martian upper atmosphere, especially its interaction with the solar wind.
(iii) Projects under discussion
The following are among the lunar and planetary missions under discussion by ISAS: Comet Coma Sample Return Mission; Mars Rover Mission; and Venus Aerocapture/Balloon Mission.
(b) Astrophysics
(i) Project in the ASTRO series (satellites for astronomical observations)
The fifth X-ray astronomy satellite (ASTRO-E) and an infrared astronomy satellite are being studied for launch in the late 1990s.
In infrared astronomy, observations from stratospheric balloons and sounding rockets have been conducted.
Observations from the Space Flyer Unit that was launched in March 1995 are being executed.
(ii) VLBI Space Observatory Programme
A satellite for very long baseline interferometry from space, called MUSES-B, will be launched by ISAS in 1996.
It will be the first flight of the M-V vehicle being developed by ISAS.
(c) Communications
In order to increase the reliability of the satellite broadcasting system, a back-up broadcasting satellite (BS-3N) is being procured from the United States by NHK and Japan Satellite Broadcasting (JSB).
This satellite is scheduled to be launched by an Ariane rocket.
The BSAT broadcasting satellites (BSAT-la and BSAT-lb) are also being procured by NHK, JSB etc., and are scheduled to be launched in 1997 and 1998 to maintain the satellite broadcasting services currently being provided by BS-3.
(e) Research and development satellites for communications and broadcasting technology
(i) Communications and broadcasting technology satellite
The objectives of COMETS are to develop and experimentally demonstrate new technologies of advanced satellite mobile communication, interorbit communication and advanced satellite broadcasting.
The satellite weighs about 2,000 kilograms at the beginning of its life in orbit, and its design life is three years. The satellite is scheduled to be launched by an H-II rocket in the middle of 1997, and to be injected into a geostationary orbit at 112 degrees east longitude.
(ii) Advanced satellite mobile communication technology
An advanced system of L- and S-band satellite mobile communications will be developed to provide Ka-band and millimetre-wave satellite mobile communications systems with demodulator/modulator on-board satellite switches.
(iii) Inter-orbit communication technology
To provide a large-capacity data communications link from the Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS), interorbit communication technology will be developed.
(iv) Advanced satellite broadcasting technology
For future satellite broadcasting services, such as high-definition television, integrated service digital broadcasting and provincial satellite broadcasting, a satellite broadcasting system operating in the 21 gigahertz band with a multibeam antenna will be developed.
The Optical Inter-Orbit Communications Engineering Test Satellite will be launched into low Earth orbit aboard a J-1 rocket in the middle of 1998 to conduct, in cooperation with ESA, on-orbit demonstrations of pointing, acquisition and tracking technology and other key technological elements for optical interorbit communications, which will be important for future space activities.
GMS-5 was launched in March 1995 as a successor to the GMS-4.
The functions of the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) of the GMS-5 have been enhanced compared with those of the GMS-4.
For example, in addition to the visible channel and the infrared channel, a water vapour channel has been newly introduced.
Moreover, the infrared windows have been divided into two channels. The former provides information on the water vapour distribution in the atmosphere, and the latter enables more accurate determination of the sea surface temperature.
Those innovations are expected to improve short- and long-range weather forecasting services.
Furthermore, the GMS-5 has been newly equipped with search and rescue instrumentation for relay of distress signals on an experimental basis.
(i) Advanced Earth Observation Satellite
ADEOS will continue the Earth observation tests of MOS-l/1b and JERS-1.
The main objectives of ADEOS are as follows:
(a) To develop advanced Earth observation sensors;
(b) To develop a modular satellite that will be the key technology of the future platform;
(c) To conduct experiments on the relay of Earth observation data using data relay satellites to form a global observation network;
(d) To contribute to domestic and international cooperation by carrying announcement-of-opportunity sensors developed by domestic and foreign organizations.
ADEOS will carry two core sensors, the Ocean Colour and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) and the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR).
The following six announcement-of-opportunity sensors are also installed on ADEOS:
(a) NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory;

(d) Interferometric monitoring of greenhouse gases (IMG) by MITI of Japan;
(e) Improved limb atmospheric spectrometer (ILAS) by the Environment Agency of Japan;
(f) Retroreflector in space (RIS) by the Environment Agency of Japan.
The interorbit link with COMETS is another important mission of ADEOS.
ADEOS will be launched from Tanegashima in mid-1996 by an H-II rocket.
(ii) Tropical rainfall measuring mission
TRMM is being jointly conducted by Japan and the United States to measure tropical rainfall.
Over two thirds of global rainfall occurs in tropical areas, producing one of the main sources of global climate change.
TRMM will be the first mission carrying a precipitation radar to monitor tropical rainfall from space.
The precipitation radar on board TRMM will be provided by NASDA on the basis of studies carried out by the Communications Research Laboratory, which has collaborated with NASA through experiments on precipitation observation from airplanes.
NASA will provide the other sensors and spacecraft for TRMM.
The results of the joint programme are expected to contribute to scientific research in various fields, and to facilitate the understanding of mechanisms of global climate change.
TRMM will be launched in mid-1997 on the H-II launch vehicle being developed by NASDA.
(iii) Advanced Earth Observation Satellite II
ADEOS-II, the successor to ADEOS, will be launched by an H-II launch vehicle around February 1999.
The objectives of ADEOS-II are to observe global environmental change, to contribute to international science programmes such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, and to follow the ADEOS mission.
The satellite is of a modular type with a flexible solar array paddle.
ADEOS-II will have two core sensors developed by NASDA, namely the advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR) and the Global Imager (GLI).
AMSR is a microwave radiometer with six channels, from 6.6 to 89 gigahertz. Its observation targets are precipitation, cloud water, water vapour, sea surface temperature, ice distribution etc., all of which are concerned with water mutation.
The physical values associated with them are observed with high accuracy during night and day.
GLI is an advanced type of the OCTS carried on ADEOS.
GLI has been developed as a multi-purpose observing spectrometer using more spectral bands and narrower spectral bandwidths than OCTS in order to satisfy various mission requirements in terms not only of the ocean but also of vegetation and atmosphere.
ADEOS-II also carries several sensors from other agencies.
The final configuration of sensors on ADEOS-II will be defined in the near future.
(g) Development of engineering test satellites
The objective of the ETS programme is to develop the high-level technologies required for the practical utilization of satellites (for Earth observation, broadcasting, communications etc.), thereby fostering Japanese technology.
ETS-VI is a satellite in the 2-tonne class satellite with a bipropellant apogee engine and the following additional features: an ion engine for controlling the north-south orbit; a high-precision attitude control system; a light structural body; a light solar battery paddle; and a system of high heat prevention and heat control in the satellite bus part to ensure an excellent performance.
The purpose of ETS-VI is to confirm the capabilities of the H-II launch vehicle, to establish the technology of the 2-tonne geostationary three-axis satellite bus, and to test advanced satellite communications equipment.
ETS-VII, following the current phase of research and development, is to be dual-launched with TRMM from the Tanegashima Space Centre.
The purpose of ETS-VII is to acquire the basic technologies of rendezvous-docking and space robotics that are essential to future space activities.
ETS-VII consists of a chaser satellite and a target satellite.
After launching, ETS-VII detaches the target satellite in orbit, and then the chaser satellite conducts rendezvous-docking experiments with the target satellite.
It also conducts space robotics experiments by using the robot arm installed on the chaser satellite.
ETS-VIII is undergoing research and development, with the focus on mobile satellite communications and satellite sound broadcasting using the technology of large deployable antennas operating in the S-band.
(h) Space transportation system
(i) H-II launch vehicle
The H-II launch vehicle is the main system developed by Japan for space transportation in the 1990s, and meets the demand for large satellite launches maintaining a high degree of reliability.
It is a two-stage vehicle, augmented by a pair of solid rocket boosters (SRBs). It is 4 metres in diameter and 50 metres in height, with a lift-off weight of 260 tonnes.
The H-II launch vehicle is capable of launching a satellite in the 2-tonne class to geostationary orbit and a satellite of about 10 tonnes with supply materials to space station orbit.
It will be able to send an exploration spaceship of about 2 to 3 tonnes to Venus or Mars.
The first stage is powered by the LB-7, a staged combustion-cycle liquid-oxygen and liquid hydrogen engine, which delivers a thrust of 110 tonnes in vacuum.
In order to supplement the thrust of the first stage, two SRBs with a thrust of 160 tonnes each are installed. Thrust direction control of the SRBs is performed through a movable nozzle.
The second stage uses the LE-5A engine, an improved version of the LE-5 engine of the H-I launch vehicle.
The standard payload fairing measures 4.1 metres in diameter and 12 metres in length.
Its large version, produced in September 1991, measures 5 metres in diameter.
The construction of the new Yoshinobu launch site for the H-II vehicle was finished in 1991.
The first test flight was carried out successfully in February 1994, and the second was used to launch ETS-VI in August 1994.
The capability and characteristics of the H-II launch vehicle were verified through those flights.
The third test flight was used to launch GMS-5 and the Space Flyer Unit (SFU) in March 1995.
The use of the H-II launch vehicle for launching various other satellites is also being studied.
(ii) J-I launch vehicle
NASDA, in cooperation with ISAS, is developing the three-stage solid rocket called J-I, to launch small satellites.
The intention is to develop J-I at low cost in a short time by using the components of two existing vehicles, the SRB of the NASDA H-II launch vehicle and the upper stages of the M-3SII launch vehicle.
J-I is intended to be a time-saving launch system with minimum operation time at the launch site.
J-I uses the Osaki launch facilities at the Tanegashima Space Centre, which was equipped for the H-I launch vehicle.
The first test flight, scheduled for February 1996, is to carry a hypersonic flight experiment vehicle.
(iii) Launch vehicles in the M or Mu series
ISAS has started to develop the M-V launch vehicle to provide larger launch capability to meet the requirements of space science in the late 1990s and the twenty-first century.
M-V will be 2.5 metres in diameter and 30 metres in length, and will weigh 130 tonnes.
It will be able to launch a payload of 2,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit or 400 kilograms beyond the Earth gravitation region.
The first M-V flight is scheduled for 1996.
Three spacecraft, MUSES-B for the space VLBI (1996), Lunar-A for the Moon Penetrator Mission (1997) and PLANET-B for the Mars Orbiter (1998), have already been approved for launching by M-V.
The use of M-V launch vehicles is being discussed for the pursuit of a variety of space science projects and fields of study in the near future, including the following: X-ray astronomy; the Comet Coma Sample Return Mission; the Lunar/Mars Rover; the Venus Aerocapture/Balloon Mission; the Asteroid Sample ReturnMission; infrared astronomy; solar physics; and atmospheric science.

(i) Space Flyer Unit
SFU is an unmanned, multi-purpose, reusable free-flying platform that has been developed since 1987 by ISAS, MITI and the Science and Technology Agency (through NASDA).
It was launched by the H-II launch vehicle in March 1995, and retrieved by the space shuttle in January 1996.
The experiments carried out during the SFU mission are as follows:
(a) Advanced technology experiments and space observations;
(b) Verification of a partial model of the exposed facility in the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) attached to the International Space Station;
(c) Flight tests of advanced industrial technologies.
(ii) Space station programme
a. Outline of the Japanese Experiment Module
Japan decided to participate in the International Space Station Programme by developing JEM.
The major objectives of JEM are to contribute to the development and utilization, to the fullest possible extent, of space science and Earth observation; to foster the use of the space environment; to promote the general progress of science and technology; and thereby to enhance the quality of life for all.
Japan has committed itself to the development of the new technologies required to achieve those ends, including the technology for supporting and ensuring the safety of manned space flight, as well as the extension of the technology already accumulated in launching rockets and satellites.
The needs of prospective users must be fully ascertained and reflected in the design and development of JEM, which must also be carried out with due regard to international norms relating to safety, the interaction of humans and machinery in complex systems, user interfaces etc.
JEM, which is being designed in accordance with those requirements, will consist of a pressurized module, an exposed facility and an experiment logistics module.
Together they will constitute a space laboratory allowing experiments in extensive areas.
JEM is designed to be attached to the core of the space station, on which it will depend for meeting such needs as electric power, heat dissipation, living quarters for on-board engineers, air and communications.
b. Pressurized module
The pressurized module will provide an environment of one atmospheric pressure.
Crew members will be able to conduct microgravity experiments in materials and life science in a shirt-sleeve environment.
It will also have systems to control JEM operation, the exposed facility and its manipulators, as well as the airlock and other equipment.
The outer surface of the pressurized module will be covered with a bumper to guard against space debris.
There will be about 20 racks within, 10 of them to be equipped with experimental payloads.
c. Exposed facility
Crew members will use the exposed facility to conduct materials experiments, scientific Earth observation and communications and engineering tests in an extravehicular environment.
The exposed facility is designed to be connected to the pressurized module.
The JEM manipulator will be used to exchange experimental equipment or samples between the exposed section of the experiment logistics module and, through the airlock, the pressurized module.
d. Experiment logistics module
The experiment logistics module will be used to transport experimental equipment, samples, various gases and supplies.
It consists of a pressurized section and an exposed section.
The pressurized section is designed to be attached to the pressurized module and to carry and store the payload required for intravehicular activity.
The exposed section will be attached to the exposed facility, and will be used for transporting and accommodating extravehicular experimental equipment and supplies.
e. Operation and utilization of the space station
The operation and utilization functions of the space station are expected to continue and evolve for many years.
In its initial stage of utilization, industrial, academic and governmental users will conduct tests using mainly common experimental equipment.
With growing experience, users are expected to develop and utilize experimental equipment of their own design, thereby paving the way for the development of advanced technology and industrialization.
(j) Start of basic and pioneering space technology research
(i) Spaceplane
Since 1986, NAL has been engaged in research on and development of a horizontal take-off spaceplane capable of flying into space and landing with a degree of safety similar to that of an ordinary airplane.
Important fields of research on the basic technology for such a plane include those concerned with atmospheric forces, structures, guidance control and engines.
Another important field is that of systems research, which is needed to clarify conceptual aspects of the spaceplane.
Research and development will be continued to overcome the problems involved.
(ii) Basic research on winged launch vehicles
To conduct a basic study on winged space vehicles, a multidisciplinary working group of researchers from all over the country has been organized at ISAS.
The group has worked to identify the following major areas of study relevant to winged vehicles: aerodynamics and flight dynamics; navigation; guidance and control; development of recovery and automated landing systems; scientific experiments with the test vehicle; microgravity experiments with the test vehicle; and development of an advanced hydrogen rocket engine.
As a first step, a gliding test of a small-scale model was carried out in June 1986, with follow-up flights in October 1987. Useful data for further studies was obtained in the first two areas of study referred to above.
In 1992, a solid-propellant rocket launched a winged vehicle into the upper atmosphere from a balloon floating at high altitude. It performed the first Japanese controlled aerodynamic re-entry flight.
(iii) H-II Orbiting Plane
HOPE is a winged unmanned space vehicle designed to be launched on the H-II launch vehicle.
The objective of the HOPE project is to recover objects from orbit and establish the basic technology for completely reusable space transport vehicles of the future.
Test flights of the planned space vehicle are to take place after the turn of the century.
The main conceptual features of HOPE at the present stage are as follows:
(a) It will be mounted on and launched by the two-stage H-II launch vehicle;
(b) It will be an unmanned vehicle;
(c) It will return to the landing grounds through winged gliding flight;
(d) It will land on the runway automatically;
(e) It will allow subsequent addition of the rendezvous-docking functions for space activities.
HOPE is being studied by NASDA and NAL on the basis of those design concepts.

NASA plans to develop and operate an Earth observing system-AM1 (EOS-AM1) polar orbiting platform, thereby creating an integrated scientific observation system through international cooperation.
The advanced resources searching sensor of MITI will be mounted on EOS-AM1.
(vi) Inter-Agency Consultative Group for Space Science
In 1981, when preparations for missions to encounter Halley's comet were about to begin, four space agencies - ESA, Intercosmos of the Academy of Sciences of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, ISAS and NASA - formed the Inter-Agency Consultative Group for Space Science (IACG).
The task of IACG was to informally coordinate all matters relating to the space missions to Halley's comet and the observations of the comet from space.
The collaboration of IACG proved to be invaluable for the success of the cometary mission.
Vital information was exchanged on the cometary path, the cometary dust environment and experiment design.
Hence, when the encounter ended, all delegations recognized the advantages of the close cooperation that had occurred, and agreed to continue IACG.
As its next project, IACG adopted the Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme at its meeting held at Padua, Italy, in 1986.
The Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme addresses the effects of solar ultraviolet and plasma emissions on the atmosphere and the magnetic field of the Earth.
Beginning with AKEBONO in 1989, about 20 missions were approved or planned for the period from 1989 to 1996.
ISAS collaborates in the AKEBONO, Geotail and SOLAR-A missions.
(vii) Multilateral cooperation
Japan has been attending sessions of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee and Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, and actively participating in their discussions since 1962.
Japan has also been exchanging information and opinions with various countries.
E. Jordan Jordan has submitted a proposal to host the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education to be established in western Asia.
The Royal Jordanian Geographic Centre (RJGC) and Al Al-Beit University have expressed their commitment to provide the permanent facilities required to manage the Centre.
In view of the need for the participation of academic institutions in order to ensure the success and sustainability of the Centre, the Higher Council for Science and Technology held a workshop that was attended by all the concerned institutions, in particular the following: the Higher Council for Science and Technology, the Royal Jordanian Geographic Centre (RJGC), Al Al-Beit University, the University of Jordan and the Department of Meteorology and the Department of Space Telecommunications of Jordan.
RJGC conducts regular training programmes as well as a three-year diploma course in surveying and cartography through its community college, which is being considered for upgrading to a university college in collaboration with the University of Jordan.
It is planned that the proposed university college will offer a five-year programme of courses involving three years of general education and two years of specialized education in cartography, photogrammetry, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing.
RJGC is engaged in a number of projects of national importance involving remote sensing and GIS applications.
1. Projects involving the application of space science and technology
(a) Hydrological projects
(i) Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia
A project has been undertaken by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia to evaluate water resources (surface and ground water) in the region of south-western Asia.
RJGC has prepared studies of the area using satellite images, GIS and remote sensing techniques to produce regional hydrological and hydrogeological maps.
(ii) Selection of sites for dams
A project has been undertaken to select seven sites for potential dam construction in different areas in Jordan in collaboration with the Jordan Valley Authority.
The selection will be based on the topography and storage capacity of the sites, which are located at Wadi Al-Shalalah, Karak, Ajiloun, Tafileh and Wadi Shuaib.
(iii) Study of flood effects in Petra
In a study of flood effects in Petra, satellite images and GIS are used to establish a model for flood hazard zoning.
(iv) Studying the Dead Sea recession
A study has been undertaken to delineate the water body of the Dead Sea by using satellite images and aerial photography taken between 1945 and 1994.
(b) Land use and desertification
Land use applications using radar satellite imagery for the areas of Madaba and Azraq are being studied, and comparisons have been made using satellite imagery.
The deterioration of land use as a result of human activity and the extent of urban development in the Amman Greater Area is being investigated for the period between 1945 and 1994, using satellite imagery and aerial photography.
The role of satellite data and GIS techniques in land use is exemplified by a study undertaken to establish optimum land use in the Irbid area by investigating the geomorphological, topographical, land-cover and agricultural aspects of the area.
A project on the desertification of Al-Azraq wetlands monitors environmental pollution in the Al-Azraq area using multi-temporal analysis for the period between 1975 and 1994 to show the diminishing of the natural plant cover as a result of irrigated vegetation and the consequent depletion of water reserves in the area.
(c) Other projects
Using aerial photographs, remote sensing and GIS, landslide hazard detection is being performed on the Amman-Jerash motorway in order to suggest an alternative route.
Another project involves landslide mapping using SAR in the Al-Zarqa river basin.
Landslide hazards in the Wadi Al-Karak basin are also being studied using GIS and SPOT images to delineate areas of existing landslides and of probable landslides.
The Department of Meteorology of Jordan conducts space activities through its two satellite stations, one of which is installed at the old airport, the other at the Queen Alia International Airport.
The latter station is used for receiving pictures from Meteosat satellites two or three times daily, especially for cloud cover and plantation coverage.
The cloud pictures are mainly used for aviation forecasting, and there is a weather radar.
The Department operates 13 meteorological stations.
There are two more stations used exclusively for monitoring pollution and a network of solar radiation recording stations.
Since 1986, a programme for enhancing rainfall through cloud-seeding from the ground with silver iodide has been implemented.
According to some estimates, there has been a 19 per cent increase in precipitation.
There is also a programme to monitor surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea and to compare them with actual on-site measurements in ships.
At Aqaba, temperature accuracy by the two methods has been noted to be of the order of 1.5 degrees centigrade.
2. Multilateral cooperation and national telecommunications policy
Jordan is a member of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).
The Department of Space Telecommunications in the Ministry of Communications of Jordan is in charge of international telephone and television traffic and the promotion of satellite communications for the public and private sectors, utilizing the satellites of INTELSAT and the Arab Satellite Communications Organization.
Jordan has three ground receiving stations which are used in the exchange of television programmes all over the world, and in retransmission from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and vice versa.
Jordan has direct dial services with 140 countries.
Direct dial services are established not only via satellite but also via submarine cables routed through the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.
Regular telephone lines are used for fax services, and require approval in accordance with international standards.
Since 1986, the Government of Jordan has reconsidered the role of its postal, telephone and telegraph services in national development by extending narrow- and wide-band services of the Integrated Services Digital Network.
Offering incentives to attract private investors to the telecommunications sector and assigning them a definite role in expanding and upgrading the system have also been considered.
The Government has already completed the first phase of implementation of a restructured telecommunications policy permitting private sector involvement in the sector through the provision of services such as cellular telephony and data transmission. F. South Africa
The following is a compilation of summary reports of space-related activities of South Africa during the past year. 1. South African Astronomical Observatory
Unquestionably the highlight of 1994 was the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.
All four telescopes at the Sutherland observatory were scheduled to observe the event.
The most spectacular results were obtained with the infrared camera on the 0.75-metre telescope, which showed the development of the fireball resulting from the impact of each fragment.
The public interest and media coverage were phenomenal, and included live coverage of the largest fragment, Q1.
Sutherland was extremely well-placed to observe seven of the impacts, the weather was favourable, and all were recorded.
In addition to the "the great crash of 1994", research at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) has been carried out over a wide range of astronomical topics, frequently involving international collaboration.
SAAO participated in ground-based, multiwavelength observations of sources detected by space observatories and in concerted campaigns focused on individual targets as determined by the time-critical nature of the observations.
The input of data from an observatory in the southern hemisphere at the longitude of SAAO is essential to the success of the campaigns.
Cosmological studies at SAAO have continued primarily by measuring the line-of-sight velocities of galaxies.
This has contributed to determining the correlation length of X-ray emitting clusters of galaxies, the distribution of galaxies in the southern hemisphere and the mapping of large-scale structures behind the Milky Way.
Contributions to the understanding of the Galaxy have been based principally on infrared observations.
From SiO maser sources towards the galactic centre, the average rotation period of the galactic bulge was found to be 8.5 x 107 years.
Infrared astronomical satellite (IRAS) sources in the Sagittarius-I field were studied and their properties compared to those in the Large Magellanic Cloud and solar neighbourhood.
An infrared survey of the galactic centre for variables has been initiated using a wide-format infrared array camera.
A study of IRAS sources in the south galactic cap has shown that they are mostly non-Mira M or S stars, probably a mixed population and similar to those of the inner bulge of the Galaxy.
As a result of the follow-up of R√∂ntgen Satellite X-ray sources, a number of interesting magnetic cataclysmic variables have been discovered.
These interacting binary systems reveal a remarkable variety of astrophysical phenomena depending upon the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf.
Spectroscopic, photometric and polarimetric observations are essential to interpret the physical properties of the systems.
Substantial progress has been made in the study of pulsating stars, with SAAO participating frequently in multisite campaigns, which are necessary to elucidate the nature of some variables.
Discoveries have been made of new pulsating stars, including members of rare classes, and a new class of pulsating F-type star has been established.
The radii of galactic Cepheids, which are fundamental distance calibrators, have been determined more accurately than hitherto by using extensive infrared, optical and radial velocity data.
In 1994, the results of research by SAAO staff and other astronomers using the facilities of SAAO were published in 146 papers in astronomical journals and in conference proceedings.
The publications that included SAAO authors exceeded those of previous years.
Over 60 per cent of the papers appeared in referred journals.
The number of papers published in 1995 was not available at the time of writing the present report, but it is expected to exceed that of 1994.
A comprehensive document on the funding of the Southern African Large Telescope has been completed and distributed to scientists, decision makers and potential international partners.
An international working group to promote the project, involving representatives from Germany, Namibia and South Africa, was established, and held two meetings during 1994, one in Germany and one in Namibia.
On the technological side, the large-format platinum-silicon infrared camera (the outcome of collaboration between SAAO and Japan) was improved, the optical charge-coupled device (CCD) was developed further, and a highly successful CCD autoguider was commissioned on the 1.9 metre telescope.
Software techniques have been developed for the automatic reduction and analysis of differential CCD photometry.
An SAAO Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM) to measure seeing has been commissioned and tested at Sutherland, and compared with a European Southern Observatory DIMM on the Gamsberg in Namibia.
The quality of the dome seeing in the building with the 1.0-metre telescope has been substantially improved as a result.
An important development has been the SAAO education initiative, which is aimed at stimulating an interest in basic science among young people through contact with astronomy.
A resource centre has been created for teachers, courses for teacher training are being developed, and there are plans to include astronomy in the physical science syllabus of schools.
Astronomy has a natural appeal to the young, and can have a very positive effect in stimulating an interest in science and technology.
Such an interest is vital to the future development of South Africa.
In 1994, SAAO organized the Annual Review of South African Astronomy and Astrophysics, which included participants from overseas and from nine South African universities and institutes.
A month-long Summer School in Astronomy was held at Cape Town for selected third-year physics and mathematics students from South African universities.
2. Department of Posts and Telecommunications
South Africa has been a member of the INTELSAT since its establishment and of the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) since 1994.
South Africa makes use of the satellites of INTELSAT for its public traffic with foreign countries (including some countries in Africa) and for the distribution of broadcasting signals in South Africa.
For communication between fixed points and vehicles or between fixed points and areas where telecommunication infrastructure does not exist, the satellites of Inmarsat are used.
In addition to the INTELSAT system, broadcasters started using the satellite service of PANAMSAT during 1995.
This system will also be used by Transnet, the communications unit of the public railway utility, for its own communications.
Towards the end of 1993, so-called Ku-band INTELSAT services became available for South Africa, enabling Telkom SA Ltd., the public telecommunications operator of South Africa, to provide dedicated, small satellite terminals to clients whose volume of traffic justifies a dedicated satellite service.
A lively commercial interest in the provision of telecommunication service by means of satellites continues. South Africa was recently requested by a United States/South African consortium to register frequencies for a new satellite system with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
This satellite system is expected to become operational in 1998.
It is proposed to provide space segment capacity to countries in the southern African subregion.
3. University of Stellenbosh
SUNSAT is a 60-kilogram microsatellite being developed by a team of 27 graduate students at the University of Stellenbosh.
Its prime research role is to test a 15-metre-resolution, tricolour pushbroom imager with a 45-kilometre swath on a microsatellite of that size. Is also carries an amateur radio communications package for international and national use.
This satellite, the first developed by a South African university, is a significant research project for the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University.
A schools project is being run in association with the South African Amateur Radio Satellite Organization (SA-AMSAT).
SUNSAT is gravity-gradient-stabilized for minimum energy consumption, but includes magnetictorquers, small reaction wheels and precision horizon sensors for attitude control to miliradian accuracy.
It uses a system concept that can be realized without the need for conventional space-reliability components.
NASA agreed to launch SUNSAT as a secondary payload on the Delta II Argos/P91-1 mission.
In exchange, SUNSAT was increased to a height of 62 centimeters to fly laser reflectors and a NASA precision GPS receiver for research in gravity recovery and atmospheric tomography as part of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth.
Modal survey tests and other structural evaluations have shown SUNSAT to be satisfactory for carriage on the Delta II.
SUNSAT will also carry a scientific magnetometer.
Together with data from the Danish Oersted satellite, which will be released in the same orbit as SUNSAT, it can provide valuable magnetic research information.
The mission, originally scheduled for January 1996, has been delayed to March 1997.
A launch in May 1996 on another mission is being investigated by NASA.
Construction of the flight model of SUNSAT has started, and will be accelerated to meet the May 1996 launch date, if required.
The project is funded at a minimal level by a group of electronics companies in South Africa and by the Foundation for Research Development.
It relies on the goodwill of other companies to perform environmental tests, to manufacture various structural components, and to obtain donations of components from a number of suppliers.
The project has developed some subsystems for use by other satellites, and is seeking partners.
A number of international student exchanges have already occurred.
Further information on SUNSAT is available on the Internet WWW at http://esl.ee.sun.ac.za and arnsat.orq.4.
University of the Witwatersrand
Professor David Block, of the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand, at Johannesburg, is the leader of an international team of astronomers that has achieved a breakthrough in the imaging of intergalactic cold dust.
An International Conference of Astronomers will be held at the University of the Witwatersrand from 22 to 26 January 1996 to focus on changing perceptions of the morphology, dust content and dust-to-gas ratios of galaxies.
This will probably be the largest astronomical conference ever held in South Africa.
5. Satellite Applications Centre
The Satellite Applications Centre of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is located at Hartebeesthoek, in the vicinity of Johannesburg.
It has business interests in remote sensing and satellite tracking services.
Remote sensing as a business is based on the reception, processing and distribution of resource data from the polar orbiting satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the LANDSAT thematic mapper sensor, the French SPOT series (panchromatic and multispectral data) and the SAR sensors of ESA ERS-1 and ERS-2.
Digital archives are maintained; in some cases the records date from 1972.
Thanks to the geographic position of the Centre at Hartebeesthoek, its data acquisition programmes cover the entire southern African region up to the equator, including also Madagascar.
Data products conforming to international standards are being supplied to users worldwide, and are increasingly being supplemented by value-added products in map format, for use in GIS.
The Centre has its second area of business in the provision of tracking, telemetry and command services, 24 hours per day, all year round.
The facility is part of the CNES 2-gigahertz network.
6. Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory
Within the same complex as the Satellite Applications Centre, South Africa operates the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HARTRAO).
Although primarily used for astronomical research, the 26-metre radio telescope is actively involved in space geodesy, using VLBI techniques to measure plate tectonic motions of all continents with respect to Africa.
HARTRAO also makes supporting radio observations of objects currently being investigated by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.
HARTRAO will make its facilities available as a ground support VLBI station for the Japanese MUSES-B satellite in 1996 and for the Radioastron satellite of the Russian Federation when it is launched.
7. Other ongoing research
South African Universities have, during 1995, been involved in a number of other projects, as exemplified by the work done by the Space Physics Research Institute at the Durban campus of the University of Natal.
The research programme of the Institute includes research in magnetospheric and atmospheric physics.
The major programmes are Antarctic Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Ground-base Observations (AMIGO), Southern Hemisphere Auroral Radar Experiment (SHARE) and General Magnetospheric Studies and Ozone Studies.
SHARE and AMIGO form part of the South African National Antarctic Research Programme, which is carried out at Sanae Base in the Antarctic in collaboration with other research institutions in South Africa and other countries.
The outer space activities of Thailand are focused on two areas: remote sensing and communications.
1. Remote sensing
(a) Background
The Thailand Remote Sensing Centre (TRSC), under the auspices of the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), is the national centre for remote sensing activities.
TRSC was established in 1971, and its activities are directed by the National Remote Sensing Coordinating Committee, whose members are representatives of relevant agencies.
In 1981, the ground receiving station was completely constructed, enabling it to receive LANDSAT signals with the radius of data reception extending approximately 2,800 kilometres from Bangkok.
The Thailand Ground Receiving Station currently has the capability to receive data from a variety of satellites, including LANDSAT, SPOT, ERS-1 SAR imagery, and MOS, JERS and NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer data.
Remote sensing activities conducted in fiscal year 1995 are reviewed below.
(b) Data reception, production and distribution
Planning for data acquisition is carried out daily by the Satellite Operations Centre.
The receiving station routinely acquires and stores data in the digital tape archives.
Satellite data are supplied via computer compatible tapes (CCTs), paper print and film, in accordance with user requirements.
In 1995, TRSC provided domestic and international customers with a total of 1,067 photographs and 508 CCTs containing satellite data.
(c) Data applications
Satellite data have been utilized in many fields, including agriculture, forestry, land use and land cover mapping, geology, map updating, natural disaster monitoring and environmental studies.
In the field of agriculture, satellite images have been used for crop acreage surveys and mapping as well as agricultural planning.
Forest applications include forest area estimation and mapping, forest monitoring, forest fire assessment and forest management.
Other applications include flood disaster monitoring and assessment and the application of remote sensing and GIS in matters of national security.
Besides TRSC, other government units are involved in remote sensing applications, including the Department of Agricultural Extension, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Forestry, the Department of Land Development and the Office of Agricultural Economics.
(d) Education, training and research
Most of the universities in Thailand, such as Chulalongkhon University, Kasetsart University, Thammasart University, Chiangmai University and Khon Kaen University, have included remote sensing in their regular syllabus.
TRSC has organized both training in and seminars on remote sensing and GIS, and has so far trained nearly 500 participants from various agencies, including civil service departments, military offices and educational institutions.
Each year, TRSC has granted 3 million baht to remote sensing projects proposed by Thai researchers as a means of promoting applications of the technology in Thailand.
In 1995, nine research projects were funded under the grant.
(e) Regional remote sensing centres
In 1994, TRSC established regional remote sensing centres in three regions, with the objective of promoting the utilization of satellite data and transferring remote sensing and GIS technologies to the regional level.
Three educational institutions, well endowed with the necessary facilities and resource persons have been appointed as regional centres, namely Chiangmai University in the northern region, Prince of Songkhla University in the southern region and Khon Kaen University in the north-eastern region.
In 1995, TRSC supported the regional centres in terms of both the budget and resource persons for the promotion of remote sensing applications and the transfer of technology to local users and students in the regions through seminars, training, workshops, university courses and research projects.
The three regional centres organized three seminars, which were attended by a total of 367 participants from 182 agencies.
(f) Publications
TRSC publishes two quarterly newsletters for dissemination of information to users, one version in Thai and the other in English.
It also publishes an annual report in Thai summarizing the activities of the centre over the past year.
Most research work is reported in Thai, except when conducted in cooperation with international organizations.
(g) International cooperation
Besides working with the relevant agencies in Thailand, TRSC has also cooperated with agencies in other countries and with international organizations.
Cooperative projects conducted in 1995 include: the Regional Remote Sensing ERS-1 Project of the European Communities and ASEAN; the GlobeSAR Project; the Global Research Network System Project; Joint Research on Enhancement of Remote Sensing Technology in Tropical Environment Monitoring; Joint Research on the Changes of Tropical Forest and their Influence; and the Asian JERS-1 Project.
TRSC also initiated cooperation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
The first cooperative activity was the Workshop on Application of Remote Sensing and GIS for Natural Resources Management, held at Vientiane.
(h) Seawatch Thailand Programme
The Seawatch Thailand Programme is a marine surveillance and information system consisting of a network of moored data buoys in the Gulf of Thailand collecting meteorological and oceanographical data for the database at NRCT.
Authorized users can transfer data through the Oceaninfo system or receive monthly plots by mail.
(i) Smallsat Programme
An Earth observation small satellite mission has been approved in principle by the Government of Thailand.
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, through its technical authority in NRCT and in cooperation with the Canadian Space Agency, will own and operate the satellite system.
The satellite is scheduled to be launched in 1998, with the parameters indicated in the table below.

2. Space activities and projects of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(a) Asia-Pacific multilateral cooperation on space technology and applications
Originally, China, Pakistan and Thailand signed a memorandum of understanding to organize workshops and conferences in each country concerned.
The Republic of Korea subsequently joined the arrangement and the four countries agreed on the following two space projects: the Small Multi-Mission Satellite (SMMS) and the Satellite Disaster Mitigation System (SDMS).
The SMMS project has been progressing, and details of cooperation were discussed during conferences held at Bangkok in 1994 and Islamabad in 1995.
China prepared a memorandum of understanding on the project, which was to be signed by the four countries concerned by the end of 1995.
(b) Coordination of geostationary satellite orbital positions
Thailand has been using one position at 78.5 degrees east, which co-located Thaicom 1 and 2.
Thailand is seeking to achieve coordination and cooperation through the project
(c) National communications satellite (Thaicom)
To cope with the increasing demands of communication by satellite, the Government of Thailand and the Shinawatra Company have signed an agreement on domestic satellite communications allowing the Company to provide satellite communications under a 30-year concession.
The specifications for the first two satellites are as follows:
(a) Thaicom-1 and -2 are identical.
Each satellite has 10 C-band transponders and two Ku-band transponders;
(b) The effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for the coverage of Thailand on C-Band is at 37 decibels above 1 watt, with a bandwidth of 36 megahertz.
The EIRP for the Ku-Band is 50 decibels above 1 watt, and its bandwidth is 54 megahertz.
(d) Membership of international organizations
Thailand has been a member of INTELSAT since its inception, and it recently became a member of Inmarsat, thus enabling it to provide international telecommunication services all over the world.
Since other facilities, such as mobile telephones, are usually provided through private international dealings, the possibility of allowing private firms in Thailand to join the Iridium programme and provide services is being considered.

INTRODUCTION
As part of the 1995 activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations, a Symposium entitled "Space Technology for Improving Life on Earth" was jointly organized at Graz, Austria, by the United Nations and the Government of Austria.
The Symposium, serving as a follow-up to the Workshop entitled "Enhancing Social, Economic and Environmental Security Through Space Technology" held at Graz in 1994, was designed to build on the experience gained during that Workshop.
The Symposium was hosted by the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Austria and co-sponsored by the State of Styria, the City of Graz, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Commission of the European Communities.
The main objective of the Symposium was to promote the use of space technology to improve living and economic conditions in developing countries.
In that regard, the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national, regional and international space programmes, and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development, taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned.
Through presentations and panel discussions, the Symposium addressed key areas of concern identified by the 1994 Workshop, placed emphasis on matching existing and expected space capabilities with existing and foreseen needs for those capabilities, and sought to identify ways to involve high-level policy and decision makers in developing countries in making use of space technologies in support of national development plans and programmes.
Recommendations were made on how to convince policy and decision makers in developing countries that space systems could contribute to social and economic security.
That was accomplished primarily by addressing the problems caused by insufficient information in the areas of education, environmental monitoring, management of natural resources and disaster warning, mitigation and prevention.
The present report was prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants were expected to report to the relevant authorities in their countries.
B. Programme
Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries.
Presentations also covered case-studies and pilot projects on the use of satellite technology to enhance food security, education and health, and to upgrade communications infrastructure and disaster early warning systems.
Throughout the Symposium, actions were identified that could convince high-level policy and decision makers in developing countries of the costs and benefits inherent in the use of well-chosen applications of space technology for sustainable development.
International and national institutions that were actively involved in space activities were invited to present an overview of programmes and specific applications in which cooperative activities with institutions from developing countries could be undertaken.
Some institutions from developing countries identified areas where their countries were or could be utilizing space technology to assist in formulating policy or implementing management decisions concerning, inter alia, sustainable exploitation of natural resources and preservation of the environment.
C. Participants
The United Nations invited developing countries to nominate candidates to participate in the Symposium.
Participants from the countries concerned held positions in institutions or private industry dealing with resource management, protection of the environment, communications, remote sensing systems, industrial and technological development and other fields related to the themes of the Symposium.
The participants were also selected because of their work in programmes, projects and enterprises in which space technology could be utilized.
They were asked to highlight, in their presentations, the key issues that would persuade them to place a higher priority on the operational implementation of space applications.
Funds allocated by the United Nations, ESA, the Commission of the European Communities and the Government of Austria were used to cover the travel cost and per diem expenses of participants from developing countries.
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Symposium: Bahrain, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela, Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe; Office for Outer Space Affairs, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO); and Commission of the European Communities, ESA, International Astronautical Federation (IAF), Inter-American Development Bank and International Space University (ISU).
Speakers, chairmen, panellists and participants from Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America also contributed to the success of the meeting.
I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE SYMPOSIUM
A. General themes
Presentations made during the course of the Symposium focused on how national and international space agencies should implement, in cooperation with developing countries, pilot projects to demonstrate the usefulness of space technology to policy makers.
As transnational industrial cooperation had become an important factor in shaping the character of space activities throughout the world, emphasis was also placed on increasing cooperation across national borders among private companies.
The global concern for the environment and sustainable development had led countries to cooperate further and make available a wider range of space-based technologies and know-how to other countries.
It was noted, however, that many policy issues remained to be addressed if space technology was to be further developed in the light of current world economic constraints.
Areas that required such policy review included financing, technology transfer, data dissemination, national, regional and international cooperation, institutional arrangements and national security.
Within the next 35 years, the world population would increase by 50 per cent, from about 6 billion in 1995 to about 9 billion in 2030.
Food production would therefore have to be increased, requiring a more efficient management of natural resources.
Participants agreed that the information technologies of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) would play a vital role in meeting those requirements.
Presentations also focused on human-induced environmental changes, particularly in developing countries, such as deforestation, which had had a dramatic impact on food production, supplies of fuel wood and fodder, soil fertility and water resources.
In terms of improving forest management, it was noted that one of the primary measures to be implemented was the development of techniques that would provide rapid and accurate information about forest conditions.
In that regard, emphasis was placed on one solution that had become operational, involving information generated by the synoptic coverage provided by Earth observation satellites.
Participants agreed that only by using data from such satellites would it be possible to monitor and quantify forest resources when whole countries or continents were involved.
B. Earth observation for sustainable development
In the field of Earth observation for sustainable development, WMO had developed a policy and practice for the international exchange of meteorological data and products.
The new policy included the free and unrestricted exchange of meteorological data essential for meteorological and hydrological services.
It also met the requirements of data and information exchange of several international conventions such as the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (A/AC.237/18 (Part II)/Add.1 and Corr.1, annex I) and the International Convention to Combat Natural Disasters.
With regard to education and training in satellite applications, the strategy adopted by WMO for satellite operators participating in the WMO Global Observing System (GOS) was to cooperate with at least one of its specialized satellite applications training centres located around the globe.
In response to that policy, the Council of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) had recently decided to co-sponsor two training centres in Africa.
Participants agreed that the utilization of Earth observation satellite data in developing countries still needed to be increased.
In that context, the representative of ESA noted that it would focus on areas in which improvements were essential for successful projects based on remote sensing for sustainable development.
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators, technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations, price reductions and easier access to data, provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis, and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national, regional and international aid agencies.
Currently, ESA systems of European remote sensing satellites (ERS), known as ERS-1 and ERS-2, provided developing countries in particular with repetitive and continued environmental monitoring.
ERS data were provided free of charge to selected scientific research groups or entities involved in operational applications.
In the near future, the ESA satellites ENVISAT-1 and METOP-1, under a joint project with EUMETSAT, were scheduled to be launched.
Scientific and technological cooperation between developing countries and the Commission of the European Communities was becoming an increasingly important and comprehensive activity with regard to the transfer of technology and knowledge.
In that context, the Commission had launched a study entitled "Analysis of the constraints and opportunities for cost-effective implementation of Earth observation techniques in developing countries".
The overall objective of the study was to facilitate decisions on future European investments in space technology applications by providing an assessment of potential opportunities in developing countries for remote sensing of Earth.
A major Canadian initiative, which would have a significant impact on global resource management, land use and vegetation monitoring, was discussed.
It involved the development of the applications-oriented Earth remote sensing satellite RADARSAT, along with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system as its remote sensing payload.
In addition to the SAR all-weather, day and night recording capability of the Earth surface, RADARSAT would have a truly global monitoring capacity, as its on-board SAR data recorders would record and store data in a format compatible with most ground stations.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was currently starting to implement a new project, the Africa Land Cover Map and Digital Geographic Database (AFRICOVER), for production of a digital geographic database and associated thematic map of land use and vegetation cover of the entire African continent.
The first phase of the AFRICOVER project was being implemented in East Africa.
The map of the entire continent would be produced at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:1,000,000.
It was noted that the overall objective of AFRICOVER was to provide African decision makers, regional and international development agencies and United Nations organizations with reliable information on current land use and vegetation cover.
It was noted that the sector of environmental resource management was an activity that involved a well-defined user community.
That community required specific tools and data types for a wide variety of activities, from data acquisition to decision-making and control.
In that context, the GEOMANAGEMENT project was presented as an umbrella concept for typical management practices in the sector.
It was noted that the project would use geo-referenced data and information as the basis for its programmes.
GEOMANAGEMENT programmes and projects at international, national and local levels should be defined on the basis of a clear definition of priority issues.
Agenda 21, the action plan adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992,1 would serve as a basis for identifying national priorities in dealing with issues such as industrial pollution, waste management, land use and allocation, deforestation and the exploitation of renewable resources.
In that connection, activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations, increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international, regional and national organizations and agencies.
In 1993, FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in close cooperation with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), initiated the Operational Low-Cost Integrated Vital Information Access (OLIVIA) programme, a long-term regional environmental programme aimed at the development and application of information technologies for natural resources and environmental management in the Asia and Pacific region.
The OLIVIA programme would support and strengthen cooperative decision-making relevant to sustainable environmental and natural resources management in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in the Asia and Pacific region, with particular emphasis on standardized and harmonized data and information exchange between interregional programmes.
In many developing countries, remote sensing and GIS were increasingly being used for mapping natural resources and hazard management.
A presentation by India on its remote sensing-based pilot project at the village level was made during the Symposium.
Applying cost-effective remote sensing techniques, land and water resources were identified in order to map the "basic integrated land and water resource units" in the Anantapur district, located in the south-west of the State of Andhra Pradesh.
Detailed mapping of natural resources on a scale of 1:50,000 had been undertaken, using data from the Information Retrieval Service (IRS) remote sensing satellite of India, known as IRS-1A.
The various scientific recommendations made on the basis of analyses of remote sensing data were validated in the field by several rural exercises.
On the basis of the encouraging results of the pilot study carried out in the Anantapur district, a nationwide project entitled "Integrated mission for sustainable development" had been launched in 172 districts spread over the whole country.
Those districts, frequently affected by droughts and floods and covering 45 per cent of the geographical area of India, were currently being extensively surveyed from outer space through the use of satellite remote sensing systems.
In the case of Malaysia, it was noted that the national meteorological agency, whose major role was to provide weather and meteorological services, was strongly supported by satellite remote sensing data.
It had been demonstrated that remote sensing from space platforms had contributed significantly to the advancement of meteorology, and in particular to a better understanding of tropical weather systems, as a means for improving weather-related disaster warning and response.
The Malaysian Meteorological Service operated a ground-based synoptic observation network to monitor weather, atmospheric and environmental conditions.
That organization depended heavily on space platform observations for the purpose of early warning of weather-related disasters such as floods and typhoons.
The dependency on space-based observing systems was a direct outcome of the excellent spatial coverage provided by those systems.
In Brazil, enormous amounts of biomass had been burned for fuel production and to clean the soil for cattle grazing and other agricultural uses.
Recent satellite images of the Amazon region had dramatically shown deforestation patterns, especially in the States of Para, Rond√¥nia and Maranh√£o.
Currently, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE), with other national and international institutions, was studying the Amazon region using both ground-based and satellite remote sensing data.
The satellite systems that had been used included ERS-1 and ERS-2, the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), LANDSAT, the shuttle imaging radar (SIR-C) and the Experimental Earth Observation System (SPOT).
In Zimbabwe, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), a donor-supported programme, used the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite system to produce crop assessments during the growing season.
The FEWS programme provided only an indication, but not a sufficiently early indication, of drought and its sequences.
It was therefore essential for the FEWS programme to be reviewed and improved in order to make it more effective as a tool for the mitigation of droughts.
C. Space communications and disaster management
The spread of electronic telecommunications had surpassed the expectations of many experts.
In the United States, an estimated 9 million individuals telecommuted at least one or two days per week.
The nearly 18 million subscribers using cellular devices in the United States were a key part of the phenomena.
Many professionals such as attorneys and accountants extended their workday by some two hours via mobile communications.
A growing number of workers in countries and areas such as Barbados, India, Jamaica, Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China were telecommunicating to other countries such as the United States and Japan.
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend, as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations.
Participants agreed that truly broad-band, high-quality and completely mobile services via satellite opened up a host of new possibilities and opportunities.
The participants noted some of those options which were becoming more accessible and cost-effective, including electronic tutors and telehealth units that could reach anywhere on Earth, flexible telecommunications services (both mobile and fixed) for home and business, wireless offices and extraterritorial networks.
In developing countries in particular, such options could be faster, more flexible and lower in cost.
The satellite communications industry had recently developed a concept using millimetre wave frequencies as a practical bandwidth for communications satellites.
For the first time, a proposal had been made for the use of low Earth orbit satellites to provide cost-effective and continuous services to rural and remote areas in parts of the developing world that lacked sufficient infrastructure.
ITU played a vital role in assisting developing countries in improving their communications infrastructure.
Special emphasis was placed on improving communications networks for remote and rural areas of developing countries through the use of satellite-based communications services.
Networks could develop incrementally without government involvement.
Furthermore, only a few local engineers would be needed to focus on limited tasks. Network extensions would be relatively low-cost, and could be funded by private sources.
There was no doubt that rural telecommunications could basically be profitable.
The main reason why so little money and time was invested seemed to be the high initial start-up cost and the expectation that a long time would be needed to reach the financial break-even point.
The cost of a conventional phone in a rural area during its first year was roughly $5,000.
The average purchase price for a hand-held satellite phone was approximately $1,000.
The lower initial investment could therefore significantly boost the availability of telecommunications in the rural areas of developing countries.
The impact would be increased by the fact that satellite phones could be easily redeployed, whereas conventional installations were more or less fixed.
In pursuing its mandate, ITU developed the Spacecom project to promote the use of satellite communications systems in rural and remote areas of developing countries.
The project was intended to provide industry with a realistic assessment of the requirements for satellite communications in rural and remote areas, to identify constraints, to propose viable solutions and to elaborate pilot projects.
It was organized so that the project sponsors (mostly international organizations and industries from developed countries) would constitute the decision-making body.
Regulatory and operating authorities in developing countries were invited to participate in the decision-making body, and ITU provided the implementation framework.
Given the typical characteristics of rural areas, such as sparseness of population, lack of trained personnel, low initial demand and high costs of installing individual services, it was suggested that the introduction of enhanced information exchange in rural areas of Africa should be achieved through the establishment of telecentres where services would be pooled to serve the entire community.
The telecentres would be located in a central village and offer a range of services depending on local needs.
The telecentres would contribute both directly and indirectly to economic, social, cultural and political development of rural areas by facilitating government administration and services, including those relevant to agriculture, rural education and health, development of economic activities and disaster mitigation efforts.
Several European countries recently agreed to jointly finance a satellite-based telecommunications system called MERCURE, for the benefit of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
In that context, a cooperative information network, known as the COPINE proposal, linking scientists, educators and professionals in Africa, was prepared by OOSA in close consultation with the secretariat of the MERCURE Governing Board.
Twelve countries had been targeted as implementation sites for the COPINE project: Botswana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
They had been selected mainly on the basis of their needs and their perceived capacity to provide the necessary physical and governmental environment that would allow the project to be successfully implemented and sustained.
That implied, among other criteria, a recognition by the Governments concerned of the important role that modern information technologies could play in advancing national development, and other local developments relating to information exchange which could enhance the eventual usefulness of COPINE.
The priority application areas selected for networks using COPINE were discussed, including health care, management of natural resources and the environment, tele-education, and the exchange of scientific and technical information.
In general, COPINE would facilitate five types of data transmission: interactive audio, image and video transmissions; large computer files on the order of 100 megabytes; interactive data transfers such as on-line database searching; scanned documents; and voice communications.
In Mexico, a seismic alert system for Mexico City had been operating as an experimental evaluation project since 1991.
The aim of the project was to mitigate the effects of earthquakes generated in the Guerrero Gap.
There was an average early-warning time advantage of 60 seconds before an earthquake occurring on the Guerrero Coast would strike Mexico City, some 320 kilometres away.
The system consisted of four parts: a seismic detection system, a dual telecommunications system, a central control system and a radio warning system for the public.
Civil government authorities, who sponsored the project, had made considerable efforts to increase earthquake preparedness.
One of the most important objectives of the civil government authorities was to achieve a high reliability level of the early-warning seismic system.
The real-time UHF/VHF radio communications system may therefore be complemented with satellite communications systems, enhancing communications between field stations and the public, and also increasing the geographical coverage of Mexico.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the course of the Symposium participants re-emphasized the vital role of space technology in improving human conditions in developing countries.
To make progress in further benefiting from such potential, solutions had to be found to several policy issues and their related technical challenges.
Participants noted that one of the most important solutions was the continued availability of satellite systems in support of social, economic and environmental development.
Participants emphasized the importance of demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of using space technology for the implementation of high-priority projects identified by Governments in national programmes for sustainable development.
Assuming that its cost-effectiveness was assured, bilateral and multilateral development and funding agencies as well as international organizations should increasingly incorporate the use of space technology in the design and formulation of development projects at national and regional levels.
Regional and international organizations dealing with social and economic development issues should increase their cooperation in order to assist developing countries in incorporating space applications into their national programmes.
The organizations specifically targeted included the Asian Development Bank, the Commission of the European Communities, ESA, UNEP, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), FAO, World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank and WMO.
Participants reiterated that remote sensing and GIS technologies would play a vital role in filling the information gap in developing countries with regard to the current state of their natural resources, land use and impact of natural disasters.
It was emphasized that some developing countries would need short-term assistance in the provision of such information to their decision makers when needed, and long-term assistance in strengthening their national capacities to be able to generate such information in an effective and timely manner.
Participants agreed that efforts should be undertaken to promote the use of space technology through the mass media, thus emphasizing the achievements of space technology and its applications, in an easily comprehensible manner at different educational levels using newly available equipment such as personal computers, CD-ROMs or other inexpensive ground receiving stations.
Furthermore, space technology curricula relating to national programmes for sustainable development in developing countries should be introduced through universities.
Developed countries should continue to assist developing countries in implementing space technology for national development plans and programmes.
In that context, it was stressed that the establishment of regional and national education and training centres for space technology would play a vital role.
Industry participation and sufficient infrastructure were also mentioned as areas of vital importance in the successful incorporation of space projects into national programmes.
If no proper policy was implemented, then the role of industry would be restricted to that of short-term contractors rather than equal partners in space applications.
In India, an infrastructure of 400 local industries as partners in the Indian national space programme had been created, on the assumption that industrial competitiveness provided the assurance of high-quality service.
In that context, participants discussed the possibility of other developing countries following the example of India in developing an industrial infrastructure contributing to national space programmes.
However, it was stated that in most developing countries, private sector involvement in space technology applications was still negligible.
National organizations and agencies should therefore seek ways and means of introducing space technology for sustainable development into the private sector.
Furthermore, non-governmental organizations should be involved in the application of space technology to various economic sectors where savings could be made.
Every country intending to profit from space technology should appoint some form of national focal point to act as a coordinator and disseminator of information both within the country concerned and within other countries and international organizations and agencies.
It was deemed to be a priority task to demonstrate to national decision makers that providing funds to space applications for sustainable development would pay off.
Specialists from developing countries stressed the need for increased standardization of satellite data, and the Committee of Earth Observation Satellites was urged to continue to give attention to that matter.
Satellite remote sensing capabilities were increasingly being built into environmental monitoring units within ministries for environmental protection.
While that was a significant improvement regarding the use of satellite remote sensing as a tool for policy- and decision-making, ministries in many developing countries were still constrained by the lack of funds and of executive responsibility.
In that context, the need for improved access to inexpensive remote sensing data in a standardized format on a continuous basis was stressed.
Remote sensing technologies had been developed mainly in developed countries.
Developing countries had sought to incorporate those technologies into their development plans and programmes, yet most developing countries were still not prepared to implement remote sensing programmes because of the high cost of remote sensing data, limited manpower and funding resources and a lack of organizational structures.
Participants repeatedly emphasized that remote sensing and GIS were valuable tools for resource managers and policy makers concerned with the preservation of the environment and national development plans.
Despite technological advances, decreasing costs and increasing "user-friendliness", the potential offered by those technologies had not yet been fully assessed or realized.
Further investigations were therefore needed to assess the costs and benefits associated with remote sensing applications.
Sufficient training and education possibilities were critical for successfully incorporating remote sensing and GIS technologies into national development plans.
Training was required at a variety of levels and in a number of forms, from one-day to one-week seminars for senior resource management personnel to two-week to three-month training classes for advanced technical personnel, to university degree training at undergraduate and graduate levels.
Given the importance of training, it was noted that a number of regional and international organizations and agencies offered various training programmes.
Despite those efforts, however, the lack of trained personnel in developing countries continued to be a critical constraint on the full exploitation of remote sensing and GIS for developmental purposes.
The relationship between access to information and level of income was already strong and becoming stronger both within and among countries.
The information revolution threatened to increase inequities, but it also provided tools to reduce poverty.
Improved access to education, health care and environmental information was increasingly available to developing countries because of recent developments in information technology.
Rural and poor urban communities could be integrated into economic life, and thereby raise their income levels through information services.
The end-user should be the focal point of all serious attempts to develop successful new satellite communications services.
Planners should tailor the range and mobility of the service requirements to respond to those challenges, and map technologies to meet the needs of the end-user.
In the future, the design, development and deployment of user-friendly satellites should be given the highest priority in the design and deployment of national, regional and international information infrastructures.
In developing new applications software and customer-specific systems for health, education, training, telecommuting and further relevant social services, the United Nations and its Member States should strengthen their leadership role.
An entity such as ISU, for example, could be petitioned to compile a global database of all satellite and fibre optic systems currently in operation.
Once created, such a database could be interactively assessed by worldwide health and education organizations to determine how those systems could be made available for low cost tele-education, telehealth and telemedicine services.
There had been several recent successful efforts among international funding agencies to study possible applications of telecommunications technology and to implement projects in developing countries.
The University of the West Indies Distance Teaching Experiment, the Indonesian Distance Education Satellite System, and the Peruvian Rural Communications Services Project currently included 25 conference sites and reached thousands of university students, teachers, doctors, nurses, health-care workers and researchers.
With the improved skills, greater knowledge and up-to-date information afforded by those programmes, the recipients of training were better able to support national development plans.
Moreover, the programmes could be used as models for future training efforts.

INTRODUCTION
It was co-sponsored by the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS) on behalf of the Government of Sweden, and hosted by the Department of Physical Geography of Stockholm University and by the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC Satellitbild).
The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of university educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce elements of remote sensing technology into the curricula of their academic institutions.
The present report describes the organization of the training course, its technical contents, and the projects undertaken by the participants during the course.
The choice of projects reflected both the academic interests of the participants and current national development issues in their countries of origin.
The report presents the results of the course evaluation and the proposed follow-up plan of action.
It was prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Application forms and information brochures on the training course were sent out in early December 1994 by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations to offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for transmission to the relevant national authorities.
The same materials were also sent out simultaneously by Stockholm University to the embassies of Sweden in 75 countries and to previous participants in the course for local distribution.
The target group comprising 75 countries whose development needs reflected the priorities of Sweden was selected by BITS.
Over 110 completed applications were subsequently received and jointly processed by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and Stockholm University.
The training course was attended by 25 participants, three of whom were female.
Participants came from the following countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe.
Instructors came from the Office for Outer Space Affairs, BITS, the European Space Agency, SSC Satellitbild, Stockholm University, the Swedish National Space Board, the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and Uppsala University.
Funds for the international travel of 12 participants from developing countries were provided by the United Nations.
All other support, including air travel for 13 participants, room and board, course materials and inland transport for all 25 participants was provided by the Government of Sweden.
Addresses were given at the opening ceremony by the President of Stockholm University and by the representative of the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The representative of BITS presented an overview of Swedish aid policy, and gave some insight into the ongoing restructuring of Swedish aid organizations.
The restructuring had been completed and the BITS replaced by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).
The programme of the training course (see annex I) was prepared by the Department of Physical Geography of Stockholm University in consultation with the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The course consisted of a series of lectures and laboratory and field exercises.
Technical visits were made to a number of sites of interest, including the ESA/Salmijarvi and Esrange satellite receiving stations, and the Kirunavaara underground mine.
Six days of the course were spent at Satellitbild, the Swedish Space Corporation facility for data processing and map production at Kiruna.
The participants were allowed three and a half days for the visual interpretation of remote sensing images of regions of their countries which they had selected.
Among the highlights of the course were the presentations made by participants on the results of their visual interpretation projects.
A description of the projects is presented in annex II.
A summary presentation of the topics introduced during the training course is given in section I below.
This presentation selectively describes basic aspects of satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) which must be sufficiently appreciated by users of remotely sensed data for their effective application to the national development problems or academic issues identified by the participants.
An analysis of the course evaluation as well as the plan for follow-up action are presented in sections II and III, respectively.
Data from several different satellites (for example, European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS), Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat), Syst√®me pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT), Resurs, Japanese Earth Resource Satellite (JERS), Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) and Meteosat) were useful in the analysis of problems related to national development, especially those pertaining to the assessment of natural resources and monitoring of the environment.
For the training course, which stressed visual interpretation of Earth observation data over terrestrial surfaces, data from Landsat and SPOT satellites were emphasized.
Requests for satellite imagery and associated products could be made to a number of vendors, including Satellitbild.
Users could also directly access metadata, in other words, information on the availability and quality of satellite images, and even preview samples of images.
The metadata were increasingly being made available as databases on CD-ROM (for example, the Ocean Color European Archive Network (OCEAN) image-base consultation system, the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) CD browser known as Ionia).
Some databases could also be accessed via Internet.
A number of important criteria, such as cloud cover, date and frequency of image acquisition and spectral and spatial characteristics, must be borne in mind when ordering satellite remote sensing images.
While, for example, the overall percentage of cloud cover in a given image might be acceptably low, the clouds that were present might obscure the specific geographical zone of interest.
It was therefore desirable to preview images prior to purchase.
The date of image acquisition had a direct bearing on the various uses to which it could eventually be put.
For example, whereas wet season images would be useful for determining vegetative cover, they were less useful for mapping landforms and soils.
The revisit capability of the satellite also played a role in the potential applications of the images collected.
While a given geographical area of interest might be imaged by the AVHRR instrument on a daily basis, the Landsat TM and SPOT series of satellites offered revisit capabilities of 16 and 26 days, respectively.
In the case of SPOT imagery, the revisit capability could be reduced to 1 or 4 days using the off-nadir viewing capability of that sensor to facilitate the monitoring of short-lived phenomena, such as certain categories of natural disaster.
The appearance of remotely sensed images was determined by several factors, including sensor, atmospheric and terrain characteristics.
Multispectral data, such as those acquired by the IRS, Landsat, Meteosat and SPOT series of satellites, were collected in multiple spectral bands.
The optical, multispectral scanners sensed the solar energy reflected or emitted by surface features.
By contrast, radar satellites, such as the ERS-1 and 2, JERS and Radarsat, exploited the microwave region of the spectrum.
Those satellites carried instruments that transmitted microwave energy in pulses and measured the travel time of the back-scattered microwave signal.
The multispectral scanners were normally used to acquire images during daylight hours.
While the data from those scanners might be affected by local atmospheric conditions (for example, clouds that blocked observation of surface features), the acquisition of images from radar satellites was not similarly constrained.
In general, the multispectral and radar instruments exploited different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and could often yield complementary information useful for tackling a variety of national development problems.
Apart from a consideration of the radiometric characteristics (i.e. number and type of spectral bands) of a given sensor relative to the spectral characteristics of the features of interest, the type of satellite imagery that would be useful for a given application was dependent on the level of detail required.
The ground spatial resolution of imagery was often a determining factor in its application, since it was indicative of the smallest distinguishable surface feature.
In the case of Meteosat visible channels, for example, the ground spatial resolution was nominally 2.5 kilometres, whereas for SPOT multispectral imagery, it was 20 metres.
That level of spatial resolution rendered SPOT multispectral imagery useful for preparing maps up to a suggested maximum scale of approximately 1:50,000.
The raw images collected by optical sensors on board the satellites were corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions, in order to facilitate subsequent visual image interpretation or computer classification and to assure that they could be superposed on pre-existing maps as required, for example, in a GIS.
In response to user needs and capabilities, vendors of satellite remote sensing data usually offered several different value-added image products, each reflecting different levels of processing and correction (e.g. system- or precision-corrected images).
System-corrected images were those which had been corrected for predictable distortions in the image because of factors such as Earth rotation during the imaging.
In precision-corrected images, geometric corrections were made using mathematical transformations based on several common locations (ground control points) identified within both the unrectified image and a corresponding planimetric map of an appropriate scale (e.g. 1:50,000 for Landsat images).
Alternatively, the required transformation could be developed using the locations of ground control points determined by a global positioning system (GPS) instrument.
In order to facilitate comparisons between images acquired at different dates and under different conditions, radiometric corrections, which accounted for variations in scene illumination, viewing geometry and instrument-response characteristics, could be undertaken.
The end-user might request satellite data in digital format or as photographic prints.
There were several different types of image enhancement (processing steps which rendered the images easier to interpret) which could be performed on the raw digital data to maximize their usefulness for a specific application.
Many different types of enhancement were possible, including contrast stretching, filtering, formation of band ratios, intensity-hue-saturation transformations and the formation of colour composites.
Photographic prints could be ordered from vendors with specific enhancements already made to satisfy the requirements of a chosen application.
However, access to the data in digital format gave the user the added flexibility to carry out, at his or her convenience and as the need arose, local or global image enhancements or classifications appropriate for a range of applications.
Having the data in digital format also facilitated eventual incorporation of remotely sensed information into a GIS.
Digital image processing, however, required access to related equipment (e.g. a computer and large-format printer) and software which might be lacking in some academic departments.
Visual interpretation of enhanced prints made from digital images was, on the other hand, less costly.
The field verification of thematic maps prepared from interpreted images was an important step in assuring the reliability of information derived from remotely sensed images.
The traditional magnetic compass served as an invaluable and simple tool for establishing the correspondence between locations in an image and those in the field.
However, the use of GPS instruments for that purpose was gaining in popularity owing to their simplicity of use, reasonable cost and high levels of precision.
Surface features in images could be digitally classified using a range of supervised and unsupervised approaches.
The supervised approach required that the operator should have some knowledge of a few locations within the image of the classes (e.g. soil, water or type of vegetation) being mapped.
Such information was used to guide the subsequent computer classification process. By contrast, in an unsupervised classification, the resulting classes were determined by analysis of the statistics of the multispectral images being analysed.
For visual classification, multispectral images were enhanced to emphasize features of interest (e.g. shallow water as opposed to land features) prior to printing and subsequent interpretation.
The analyst used photographic interpretation elements (e.g. tone, texture, shape, drainage, landforms, topography, and lineaments) to facilitate visual classification.
In visual interpretation, the geographical limits of the various classes were traced onto the print.
Those traces could subsequently be input to a GIS in the form of a vector map through digitization.
The vector map might be converted to raster format to suit analytical needs.
It was widely acknowledged that remotely sensed data were useful for a large range of applications.
That was reflected in the variety of projects undertaken by the participants (see table in annex II), which included applications to terrestrial as well as marine environments.
The terrestrial applications related mainly to agriculture (soil erosion, deforestation, land-use planning and siltation), geology and hydrogeology (river-bank erosion, groundwater management), the mitigation of natural hazards (landslides, glacial lake outbursts, snow avalanches, debris flows, floods etc.), meteorology, pollution and urbanization.
The sole marine application focused on problems induced by the presence of algal blooms.
C. GIS data integration and map preparation
A GIS consisted of hardware, software and data components which allowed the efficient storage, analysis and presentation of information.
The data in a GIS were georeferenced (i.e. they referred to precise, real-world geographic coordinates) with the result that different thematic maps of the same area could be exactly superposed.
To achieve that, the different maps must all have similar levels of generalization (i.e. similar original map scales of preparation) and similar geometric projection.
In general, the data within a GIS were of four generic types, namely, points, lines, tables and areas.
The areas might be polygonal, vectorial or raster in nature.
Several different operations (e.g. overlay, neighbourhood analysis, interpolation, classification and time-series analysis) could be performed on those four types of data during the course of spatial analysis prompted by a query.
Data within a GIS could be queried to respond to questions that only required the retrieval of data.
That did not involve any manipulation between layers of data.
Alternatively, the queries might involve simple to complex manipulation of several layers according to various rules or models (e.g. process, mathematical, heuristic, expert systems etc.).
GIS could also be used in simulation studies (e.g. to determine the effects of land-use changes on run-off and flooding risks, or the effect of water availability on crop yields).
The capacity to respond rapidly and interactively to questions made GIS invaluable as a decision-making tool, since many "what if" scenarios could be examined prior to the implementation of a final decision.
For example, a relatively simple query that was readily amenable to processing by a GIS was the following: "Where are the locations suitable for agriculture under rain-fed conditions which are amenable to the use of mechanized agriculture equipment and which are within 10 km of major roadways or railway lines or navigable rivers?"
To respond to that query, the needed data must include soils, rainfall, surface slope and road, rail and river networks.
A major requirement in the establishment of a GIS was to assemble a database that would be useful for tackling the range of problems to be addressed.
That could be a bottleneck to the implementation of a GIS, since unless the data already existed in digital format, they must be so converted, often by costly manual techniques (e.g. manual digitizing).
Sharing data might help to quickly develop a GIS database.
However, issues such as data exchange standards must be addressed in order to avoid problems of inaccurate data.
In general, the acquisition and input of useful data constituted one of the most critical and often costly aspects of setting up a GIS system.
Apart from its analytical capabilities, a GIS system was often used in cartographic applications to prepare paper-based maps displaying selected spatial elements from one or more digital sources as well as the results of a complex spatial analysis.
Such a GIS capability allowed maps to be tailor-made according to their proposed end-uses, as the need arose.
A knowledge of cartographic concepts, including those relating to geodetic datum, reference ellipsoid, map projection and global positioning system was necessary to fully exploit that capability.
D. Curriculum development
Conditions which influenced the implementation of a new course varied considerably between academic institutions, even those located within the same country.
A structured approach to programme formulation which took into account the specific constraints imposed on and opportunities available at a given institution was therefore necessary.
II. COURSE EVALUATION
The responses on the completed course evaluation forms were analysed by a small committee of participants whose members were selected by the participants themselves.
Formal presentation of the results of the analysis was made on the last day of the course by a member of the committee to all participants and representatives of BITS, the Department of Geography of Stockholm University and the United Nations.
Discussions following the formal presentation allowed additional inputs to be made by all participants.
The key results of the analysis of responses were that:
(a) All participants would have liked more time to be devoted to practical exercises in remote sensing and GIS;
(b) Approximately 80 per cent agreed that the course was well conceived;
(c) Approximately 70 per cent felt that they had benefited significantly from the course;
(d) Approximately 90 per cent agreed with the duration of the course.
Some participants anticipated difficulties in applying the newly acquired knowledge in their current employment.
Those difficulties, linked essentially to a lack of adequate funds, included access to remotely sensed data and to computers and software for GIS and image processing.
III. PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP PLAN OF ACTION
In light of the results of the course evaluation indicating strong interest by participants in having greater exposure to digital image-processing techniques, the Office for Outer Space Affairs proposed to examine the possibility of organizing, through SIDA, a more advanced course for remote sensing educators, during which operational computer techniques in the application of remotely sensed data would be emphasized.
Such a course would require participants to be already competent in the visual techniques of image interpretation, and might therefore include graduates of the current course.
It was envisaged that the proposed course would alternate with the current introductory course during successive years. Annex I PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE

[Original: English]
The Canadian Space Agency is pleased to report the following with respect to the acquisition and understanding of data on the characteristics of the space debris environment and mitigation techniques:
‚àô MELEO: The Materials Exposure in Low Earth Orbit (MELEO) was an active experiment flown on Shuttle mission STS-52 in October 1992.
The experiment was primarily designed to measure the effect of the environment on material specimens (313 in total) which were mounted on the CANADARM (Canadian robotic arm on the U.S. Shuttle) and exposed in the "ram" direction during the mission for a total of approximately 30 hours.
The experiment also included two active quartz crystal microbalances which were designed to operate in reverse fashion to measure the atomic oxygen fluence during exposure.
The experiment was developed by a number of co-investigators several of whom included materials designed to capture small orbital debris particles and micrometeorites.
During the mission, a solid rocket motor was used to raise a satellite payload to a high orbit after deployment from the Shuttle.
It was this event that provided the majority of data on orbital debris during the mission.
Although the material specimens were protected during the firing itself, many of the specimens which were returned to Earth for evaluation had been impacted by many small particles.
The estimated particle size was consistent with the expected effluent from the solid rocket although the duration of persistence of the debris cloud was not expected.
As a result, this experiment provided data on the orbital debris caused by the burning of a solid rocket motor.
‚àô ACOMEX: The Advanced Composite Material Exposure Experiment (ACOMEX) was also a Shuttle-based experiment flown on STS-41G in October 1994.
The purpose of this experiment was to gather data on the degradation of composite materials in low Earth orbit.
The experiment consisted of a number of material specimens mounted on the CANADARM which was positioned in the "ram" direction for approximately 40 hours during the mission.
This experiment was not designed to measure orbital debris but examination of the material specimens which were returned to Earth after the mission provided some observations which were identified as likely a result of impacts in space.
Although no detailed data resulted, this experiment did contribute to the design of the MELEO experiment noted above.
‚àô LDEF: One of the experiments aboard the Long Duration Exposure Facility was provided by Canadian Investigators from the University of Toronto.
Much has been published to date on the results from the LDEF spacecraft, which includes the results obtained from this Canadian experiment.
After return to Earth this experiment was thoroughly examined to identify impact sites.
Over 70 impact sites were clearly identified.
In addition, the data from the entire spacecraft as reported through the Orbital Debris Special Investigation Group was analysed and presented in the form of an Engineering Monogram that could be used for design of spacecraft.
Furthermore, ground testing has been used to correlate the size and type of damage experimented in the specimens with probable particle size and velocity.
‚àô The Institute for Space and Terrestrial Science (ISTS) and the University of Western Ontario are studying the space debris monitoring potential for large diameter, non-steerable, ground-based telescopes based on the liquid mirror concept developed at Universit√© de Laval.
‚àô MBP Technologies of Pointe-Claire, Quebec, is conducting a study of possible electro-optical and infrared sensors for space surveillance, particularly space-based sensors and systems; the interest is in application of millimetre-wave radar technology to observation, tracking and identification of debris.
‚àô Based on impact data recorded from LDEF, the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) develops design monograms for predicting the number of impacts on a spacecraft as a function of altitude, inclination, time in orbit and orientation.
‚àô The University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) is developing protective technologies to mitigate damage caused by orbital debris.
Furthermore, it is working on flight test experiments to be performed on the exterior of space stations.

Chile reports that at present it is not conducting any research relating to space debris and that it does not have satellites that operate with nuclear energy.
Consequently, studies are not being conducted on possible collisions of nuclear-power sources with space debris. Japan
RECENT SPACE DEBRIS ACTIVITIES IN JAPAN
Space debris is intrinsically a global problem that all space-faring nations must solve in cooperation in order to preserve a safe environment for future space activities.
One of the world's earliest warnings on this issue was made in Japan in 1971 by M. Nagatomo and his colleagues of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS).M. Nagatomo, H. Matsuo and K. Uesugi, "Some considerations on utilization control of the near Earth space in future", Proc. 9th ISTS, Tokyo, pp. 257-263 (1971).
Since that time, independent research on this topic has been carried out by various organizations in Japan.
However, any systematic or organized activities were not performed until 1990 when the Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences (JSASS) founded the Space debris Study Group.
The study group consisted of over 30 members from space-related organizations and industries and issued an interim report in January 1992 and a final report in March 1993.S. Toda and T. Yasakka, "Space debris studies in Japan", Adv.
Some of the recommendations presented in the report have been followed up by the two newly formed JSASS Study Groups.
As a result of the continuing efforts by the JSASS Study Groups, Japanese space related agencies and organizations have now recognized that the space debris hazard is no longer an abstract problem, but rather a real and serious threat to manned and unmanned activities in space.
The Japanese Government Space Activities Commission (SAC) has expressed Japan's policy on space debris in the report on Japan's Space Long Term Vision which was published in July 1994:Toward Creation of Space Age in the New Century (Report on Japan's Space Long-Term Vision) by Special Committee on Long-Term Vision, Space Activities Commission (July 1994).
"Japan will aim to develop such systems that will leave as little space debris as possible.
With regard to existing space debris, we will cooperate with other countries in considering ways of reducing it."
The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), which is responsible for implementing practical applications of space developments in Japan, founded its own working group in August 1993 to study space debris problems and to establish the NASDA policy and debris mitigation and protection standards.
In this article, the recent and planned activities in the space debris field in Japan are briefly reviewed.
I. SPACE DEBRIS MEASUREMENT
A. Optical observation
Optical observations of geo-stationary objects have been made by the Communication Research Laboratory (CRL) utilizing an optical observation system in Koganei, Tokyo (35.42¬∞N, 139.29¬∞E).
It consists of a 1.5 m aperture telescope, a peltier cooled CCD camera with a chip size of 1242 x 1152 pixels, an image processing computer and other scientific and communication equipment.
The system was originally built as a fixed ground station for space communication experiments using a geostationary satellite.
With this CRL optical observation system, objects as small as 20 cm at geostationary altitude are theoretically observable.
Therefore, it is expected to contribute to an international cooperative project to measure the debris population in and around Geostationary Orbit (GEO).
As a collaborative study with NASDA, the National Astronomical Observatory in Japan (NAO) has been conducting observations of the GEO satellites since 1992, using the Schmit telescopes of the Kagoshima Space Center (KSC) of ISAS (31.13¬∞N, 131.04¬∞E) and the Kiso Observatory of the University of Tokyo (35.48¬∞N, 137.38¬∞E).
The use of other telescopes in Japan has also been found to be promising.
For more detailed and long-lasting observations, however, a dedicated debris observation system will be required.
JSASS and NASDA will start the preliminary joint studies on a GEO satellite to detect space debris in GEO in July 1995.
B. Radar observation
Space debris monitoring by a bistatic radar system has been studied by T. Takano and his group at ISAS.
They have successfully demonstrated the applicability of this system in the observation experiment of "Yokoh" which is a scientific satellite with a mass of 420 kg in a circular orbit of 600 km altitude and at an inclination of 31.3¬∞.
In the experiment, they used the 20 m diameter antenna at KSC as a transmission station and the 64 m diameter antenna at the Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC) of ISAS (36.13¬∞N, 138.37¬∞E) as a reception station.
The distance between the two stations is about 1,000 km.
By means of modern communication technology, objects as small as 2 cm at 500 km altitude are detected.
The laser radar system for detecting space debris has been investigated by an ISAS group led by T. Yokota.
The system is composed of a Nd:Yag laser, a light beam expander, a telescope, a CCD camera, a photo multiplier and a computer.
It is estimated to have the capability to detect a particle 1 mm in diameter at a distance of 1 km.
Therefore, it can be used as an on-board space debris observation system for detecting small-size debris and for collision avoidance manoeuvres.
They have developed an engineering model of the system and are testing its basic performance.
Radar has been the most effective means of observing LEO (low Earth orbit) debris of "threatening size," which is debris pieces larger than about 1 cm.
All existing databases and statistics of such space debris, including the famous USSPACECOM catalogue, depend largely on observations with various radars.
They usually contain an important item "size," which is determined from the strength of the received echo.
In evaluating the impact of a collision of debris with a shielding wall, for example, it is common to interpret it as the diameter of a sphere.
The size of the target is computed from the radar cross section (RCS), which is defined as the area of an isotropic scatterer whose echo power is the same as the given target. It indeed agrees with the physical cross section for large metallic spheres, but often differs largely for objects with irregular shapes, especially when observed at a high frequency band.
For example, a piece of thin wire may be misinterpreted as a cannon-ball.
For objects smaller than the radar wavelength, RCS is inversely proportional to the 4th power of the wavelength (or to the 4th power of the frequency).
Most radars used for space debris monitoring thus employ a frequency of 5-10 GHz, or even higher, in order to obtain a high sensitivity for small debris.
At such a high frequency, the RCS varies drastically as the orientation of the target relative to the radar changes.
It is then hard to estimate the real cross section from the observed RCS.
At a lower frequency, on the other hand, the relation between the physical cross section and the RCS becomes much simpler, although we have to pay an expensive cost in the sensitivity reduction for small targets.
The MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar of Kyoto University, Japan, is a powerful VHF radar operating at 46.5 MHz; its 1 MW output power and the 100 m antenna compensate for the reduced sensitivity at this frequency.
The main target of this radar is Earth's atmosphere, or more precisely, weak backscattering from irregularities in the refractive index of the air caused by the atmospheric turbulence.
Since this atmospheric echo is so weak, scientists have been bothered by contamination of strong "undesired" echoes from various objects such as space debris.
We decided to make use of these previously discarded echoes and started a statistical study of space debris in 1988.
The antenna of the MU radar consists of 475 Yagi antennas constituting an active phased array.
The advantage of this type of antenna is that it can observe different directions almost simultaneously by electronically switching multiple antenna beams.
Figure 1 shows an example of debris observation using eight antenna beams switched sequentially from pulse to pulse around the zenith.T. Sato, T. Wakayama, T. Tanaka, K. Ikeda and I. Kimura, "Shape of space debris as estimated from RCS variations", J. Spacecraft, 31, 665-670 (1994).
The target, which turned out to be the Kosmos 1023 rocket booster, passed through these beams, and the variation of RCS was tracked for about 20 sec.
It is also possible to roughly determine the orbit of the target from a single observation.
Conventional radars with a large parabola antenna cannot continuously observe an orbital object for more than a fraction of a second unless its orbit is given beforehand.
The large and smooth variation of RCS versus time (shown in the lower-right panel of figure 1) indicates the rotation of the rocket booster.
The maximum value roughly agrees with its maximum physical cross section.
The most direct way to "see" the shape of a target using radar is to make the antenna beam sharp enough so that it can resolve the target.
It is, however, impractical to get a resolution of 1 m at a distance of 100 km because the necessary diameter of the antenna is in the order of 10 km.
A more sensible technique is to make use of the rotation of the target.
The idea is to resolve a different part of a target moving at a different velocity relative to the radar by measuring the Doppler velocity spectra.
This method is called ISAR (Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar), or RDI (Range-Doppler Interferometry), and has been widely used in military radars and in radar astronomy.
It was already applied to space debris by using German FGAN radar, which revealed a clear image of a Salyut-Kosmos complex.D. Mehrholz, "Radar tracking and observation of noncooperative space objects by reentry of Salyut-7/Kosmos-1686", Proc.
At the moment, the resolution is limited to about 1 m so it cannot be used to identify the shape of small targets 1-10 cm in size, which is of the greatest concern.
Figure 1.
The angular motion (left), the height variation (upper right), and the RCS variation (lower right) of Kosmos-0123 rocket booster as observed
The circles in the upper left panel show the coverage of the antenna beams.
Some statistical information on the shape of space debris is obtained by comparing the physical cross section estimated from the atmospheric drug with RCS, as shown above.
The major limitation of this technique is that the same object has to be monitored for a long duration in order to detect orbital decay.
The results of our MU radar observations also provide similar information.
Numerical simulations showed that the magnitude of RCS variation can be interpreted in terms of the prolateness of the object.
Since a single observation gives the variation seen from one direction, we need to interpret many observations in a statistical manner.
The result of such analysis indicates that the volume of relatively small debris observed with the MU radar is less than half of the sphere which has the same RCS.
In order to evaluate the actual size of space debris, shape information must be obtained.
Although the first priority in designing a future debris radar is that it should have a sensitivity to detect objects of 1-10 cm, it also should have the capability to track an unknown object continuously for at least 10 sec, which is necessary to carry out both ISAR (RDI) analysis and/or the statistical analysis shown above.
The phased array antenna is the essential element in realizing this capability. C. Impact measurements
Based on the one-year intensive study, the JSASS Study Group on Space Debris and Micrometeoroid Impact Detection has proposed the post flight analysis (PFA) of the Space Flyer Unit (SFU) to the Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer (USEF).
SFU is a Sun-pointing, 3-axis stabilized, unmanned platform facility.
It was launched on 15 March 1995 by the H-II third flight and is scheduled to be retrieved by the Shuttle STS-72 in January 1996.
It will stay in a circular orbit at an altitude of 300-500 km and at an inclination of 28.5¬∞ and will become the first Japanese space structure to be returned to Earth.
The total area of the exposed surfaces of SFU is about 150 m¬≤ and the four main large surfaces are the planned targets for PFA:
‚óè Payload Unit Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI), which is an octagonal structure 4.46 m in diameter and 1.40 m in height;
‚óè Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU), which is a box-like structure with a top surface that measures 1.48 m x 1.48 m and is covered with silver-coated Teflon for a radiator and with four side plates 1.05 m in height that are covered with aluminized Kapton MLI;
‚óè Solar Array Paddle with a length of 24.4 m and a width of 2.36 m; and
‚óè Two-Dimensional Deployable High Voltage Solar Array, which is a triangle sail with a height of 3.84 m and a base length of 3.62 m in the full deployed configuration.
It is expected that much information will be obtained through comparison with LDEF, EURECA and HST solar array PFA data.
The Japanese Experimental Module Flight Demonstration (JFD) is planned on board the Space Shuttle as a verification test of the manipulator system for the Japanese Experimental Module (JEM) of the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA).
Utilizing this opportunity, the Parts and Material Laboratory of NASDA is planning to perform the Experiment of Space Environment with Materials (ESEM).
The ESEM system consists of Dust of Space debris collectors (DC) and material sample holders (MSH) for evaluation of the atomic oxygen effect in space.
They will be mounted on the top of the JFD experiment apparatus in the Shuttle payload bay and will be exposed to the Shuttle flight direction for 40 hours.
This program is slated for April 1997.
II. SPACE DEBRIS MITIGATION
Among the different types of orbital objects, the largest number is that of fragment debris created by explosions.
These are the result of rocket upper stage explosions, intentional distractions and other unknown factors.
The nature of the latter is not quite clear, but is believed to include explosions caused by hypervelocity impacts.
In order to avoid significant accidental debris creation, NASDA has implemented draining of residual propellants (LOX, LH2, N2H4) and the residual helium gas of the H-I/H-II second stage.
The release of mechanical devices at satellite separation and solar paddle deployment has been avoided except in some particular missions, such as the separation of spent apogee motor for the geostationary meteorological satellite.
For the purpose of the prevention of unintended destruction of the H-II second stage in space, the command destruct system is disabled immediately after injection into orbit and its pyrotechnics are thermally insulated to preclude spontaneous initiation.
The objects on the geostationary transfer orbits (GTO) are increasing and are considered to be hazardous to future space activities because of their long orbital life.
An effort is currently being made to decrease the orbital life of the second stage of the H-II.T. Ujino, I. Yamazaki, T. Nakagawa and K. Mori, "Debris prevention plans of the H-II rocket", Proc. 44th IAF, IAF-93-V.5.633, Graz, Austria (Oct. 1993).
The second stage (1994-056B) of the H-II second flight of 28 August 1994, for instance, was deorbited from the ETS-VI GTO with an apogee of 36,346 km and a perigee of 251 km to GTO with an apogee of 32,298 km and a perigee of 150 km by performing idle mode burn and the depletion of residual propellants.
It was observed that the second stage had fragmented into at least six new objects by 31 March 1995 and they have already decayed.N. Johnson, private communication (April 1995).
NASDA has also implemented reorbiting GEO satellites after the end of life (EOL) at least 150 km upward, aiming at 300 km since 1985.
JSASS formed the committee on space debris prevention design standards in September 1993 at the request of NASDA.
The main objective is to discuss the technical backgrounds and to make a draft document for the "NASDA Orbital Debris Mitigation Design Standards," which is to be established around 1997.
The committee consists of members from the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), ISAS, NASDA, universities and major space-related companies.
An extensive study on the technical and economical feasibility of space debris mitigation measures has been conducted placing emphasis on:
‚óè Spacecraft and rocket upper stage passivation;
‚óè GTO upper stage deorbit;
‚óè GEO satellite deorbit after EOL; and
‚óè Other feasible and important measures, such as prevention of operational debris.
III. SPACE DEBRIS PROTECTION
Space debris protection systems have been studied by NASDA for JEM.
More than a hundred impact test data have been obtained in the impact velocity range of up to 5 km/s using a two-stage hydrogen light gas gun.
Hypervelocity impact experiments are important, not only for the design of space station protection systems, but also for the development of basic hypervelocity impact science and for understanding debris creation and dispersion phenomena.
A basic hypervelocity impact study has been conducted at NAL in collaboration with various organizations.
Impact experiments have been performed in various velocity ranges, that is, at around 2 km/s velocity with a one-stage powder gun at Kyoto University, at 4 km/s velocity with a two-stage helium gas gun at Tohoku University and at around 7 km/s with a rail gun at ISAS.
The target specimen was made of three aluminum alloy plates 3.5 mm thick which were set up with about 60 mm of space between each plate.
After the experiment it was noted that all three plates were perforated like a petal and that the petalled hole of the back plate was bigger than that of the front plate.
This illustrates that the two bumper plates before the main plate provided no protection against the debris impact with 14 g in mass and 2 km/s in collision velocity.
In order to investigate hypervelocity impact phenomena at velocities of up to 15 km/s, NAL has been conducting a collaborative study with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited on a shaped charge explosive launching system which is able to accelerate gram order mass aluminum projectiles to velocities of over 10 km/s.
A series of explosion experiments for modelling the breakup of a rocket upper stage is also planned.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The preservation of the space environment is indispensable for insuring long-lasting and expanding space activities.
Various scientific and technical proposals have been made so far, and they would necessitate, more or less, additional costs and the reduction of space system capabilities.
What is needed is to identify acceptable technically effective and cost-efficient measures.
The most critical uncertainties in space debris problems are due to our ignorance of the exact space debris environment.
The cooperative efforts of Japan with other space-faring nations and organizations are required to examine the debris population, to accumulate hard data for verifying various theories and proposals, and to evaluate various measures and the associated penalties.

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
In March 1995 and November 1995 the British National Space Centre (BNSC) continued its discussions with the national space agencies of France (CNES), Germany (DARA), and Italy (ASI) and the European Space Agency (ESA) on harmonisation of debris activities.
The topics covered were technical objectives, operational requirements, the results of completed and ongoing research studies, identification of future studies, coordination of activities and the search for a common policy on space debris mitigation.
BNSC coordinated the collection and processing of data relating to the activities and capabilities (software tools and facilities) of United Kingdom industry, academic institutions and government research centres.
The information was passed on to ESA for collation with descriptions from other member States.
A report summarizing this information will be published by ESA and made available to both member States and non-member States.
The third United Kingdom Orbital Debris/Co-ordination Group Meeting was held at the University of Southampton in Hampshire, England, on Friday, 7 April 1995.
This brought together speakers from BNSC, the University of Southampton, the University of London, the University of Kent, SIRA, the Defence Research Agency and Advanced System Architectures.
Amongst the topics discussed were short-term and long-term debris hazard modelling, ground-based optical and radar detection of debris objects, measurement of the micro-debris through the analysis of retrieved surfaces, and international initiatives relating to space debris.
The meeting was again well attended and provided the opportunity for a further dissemination of information on international programmes at the ESA and IADC levels.
A number of technical papers have been produced by United Kingdom research groups during 1995.
The reference section of this report lists some of the published papers.
UNISPACE, the Unit for Space Sciences at the University of Kent, continues to lead the European community in the analysis of spacecraft surfaces retrieved from orbit.

provided a large surface area of exposed surface which could be examined for impact sites. Through the application of empirical impact formulae relating the material characteristics of both impactors and spacecraft surfaces and the impactor speed and incidence to these surfaces to impact features, it was possible to infer the encountered micro-debris environment by counting, measuring and chemically analysing the residue observed in impact sitesW.

Such analyses also require some impact calibration tests to study the response of unique array materials to hypervelocity impact.
The solar arrays of EurecaJ.A.M. McDonnell, G. Drolshagen, D. J. Gardner, R. Aceti and I. Collier, "EuReCa's exposure in the near-Earth space environment: hypervelocity impact cratering at a time of space debris growth", Adv.
were at 99 m2 the largest exposed area on the retrieved satellite. High and low resolution images of impact sites on the array were recorded totalling more than 3,000 impact sites (>50 micron size).
There were over 1,000 impacts visible to the naked eye on each array.
The HST analysis concentrated on impact sites with features greater than 1.2 mm on the 20 m2 array area.
A total of 704 large impact features were recorded.
In each case the location, size parameters, morphological features and direction of impact were measured.
All such images were digitized and stored on compact discs that are available through ESA for further analysis.

It has been argued that this demonstrates the strong influence of atmospheric density, which reduces exponentially with altitude, and which determines the orbital lifetime of the debris particulates.
Space Res., Vol. 17, No. 12, pp. 183-188, 1996. have also been investigated by UNISPACE and they concluded that there must be a larger population of high orbital eccentricity particulates close to HST and EURECA altitudes than models predict in order to justify the high fluxes encountered.
It is interesting that many of these models rely upon the observable large debris population for the basis of their definition.
UNISPACE have also identified discrete differences in size and direction of impact of particulate populations,J.A.M.

Comparison of encountered fluxes with design environment models such as the ESABASE continues.
Two further university departments are actively engaged in collaborative research with industry to assess the short-term and long-term collision hazard to spacecraft posed by debris.
The first group at the University of Southampton in Hampshire are building upon their reputation as a centre of excellence for astrodynamics studies to find novel and efficient methods for characterizing the collision hazard that a breakup could pose for satellite systems.

The focus of their work is on the long-term prediction of the debris population through application of direct simulation Monte Carlo techniques to represent the environment evolution.
Applying techniques developed for collision dynamics in rarefied gas systems, the group have been able to model collision-induced breakups within the population.
Two groups are involved in the detection and observation of debris objects from the ground using optical telescopes.
SIRA are building on experience gained supporting ESA in previous feasibility studies to contribute to the commissioning of a 1 m ESA telescope.
Under ESA contract 10623/93/D, SIRA have provided advice and guidance to the prime contractor, the Astronomical Institute at the University of Berne, Switzerland, on algorithms for detecting and analysing debris using CCD arrays.
The second group, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, have contributed to papers considering the feasibility and accuracy of detecting objects in orbit using optical telescopes.R. Crowther, R. Walker, J.S.B. Dick, S. F. Green and J. Marchant, "Detectability of satellite fragmentations in highly eccentric orbits", Adv.
These studies have demonstrated that there are significant selection effects where objects in eccentric orbits are less likely to be detected than those in circular orbits.
The Defence Research Agency at Farnborough provides a technical focus for all the groups within the United Kingdom and supports BNSC at UNCOPUOS.
It was the first group to highlight the potential problems associated with distributed space architectures such as satellite constellations at discrete altitude. A joint paperR.
with the University of Southampton identified that for the large constellation sizes predicted for the end of the century, there were significant risks to both the constellation systems and the neighbouring missions in close proximity due to debris impacts.
This study is being extended to take account of second order (cascade) effects in a software package called Integrated Debris Evolution Suite (IDES).
This can also be used to carry out mitigation effectiveness studies.
These studies demonstrate that the United Kingdom is involved in, and in many cases has a unique capability in, a broad range of activities aimed at defining the orbital environment, assessing the hazard to space missions, and formulating policies to alleviate the growing space debris problem.

INTRODUCTION
At its thirty-second session, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space agreed that it would be desirable to compile information on various steps taken by space agencies for reducing the growth or damage potential of space debris and to encourage common acceptance of those steps by the international community, on a voluntary basis (A/AC.105/605, para. 80).
That recommendation was endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its thirty-eighth session.Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/50/20), para. 76.
The present report has been prepared by the Secretariat in response to this request and is based on information provided by Member States, as well as by national and international space organizations.
I. DEBRIS MITIGATION TECHNIQUES USED IN LAUNCH VEHICLES
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States of America established debris mitigation strategies in the early 1980s after observing that hypergolic upper stages would often explode some time after they had completed their mission.
The latent period would range from several weeks to as long as 16-27 years.
Examination of the design of the stages led to the identification of a number of potential failure modes, modes that could have led to the observed explosions.
In each case, the event occurred because of the stored energy in the flight performance residuals that had been on board at the termination of the launcher stage mission.
Since then, a number of different techniques have been used to burn or vent the stored propellants and pressurants and to open electrical circuits and batteries.
All United States launch systems execute some form of contamination and collision avoidance manoeuvres shortly after spacecraft separation.
In general, the components of the system for releasing the spacecraft remain with the upper stage.
The initial procedures to deplete stored energy were developed in 1981, when it was observed that second stages of the Delta launcher would explode some time after completion of payload delivery.
Analysis indicated that with residual propellants, the nitrogen tetroxide and helium could be heated to temperatures that would generate pressure exceeding the strength of the material.
When the tank structure failed, the propellants ignited and the stage exploded.
The fragmentation of the second stage of Delta-111 on 1 May 1991, after 16 years in orbit, supports this conclusion.
The second stage depletion burn was first implemented in September 1981, just four months after the investigation had started.
No Delta stage that has followed stored energy depletion procedures has exploded since then.
In the case of the Centaur launcher, used on the Titan and the Atlas boosters for geosynchronous orbit missions, a collision avoidance manoeuvre is conducted so that the Centaur stage is boosted into a graveyard orbit above the geostationary arc.
In all cases, the engines are burned to depletion to preclude stored energy from inducing overpressure explosions.
After completion of the depletion burn, the pressurants are vented.
The last stage of the Titan launcher is normally disposed of by leaving it on a ballistic re-entry trajectory.
When the stage has a limited orbital lifetime, the commercial Titan-2 stage is modified so that it will not overpressurize during the period before atmospheric re-entry.
To date, this has been done by thermal control paints.
In more powerful versions of Titan-2, which augment the lift capability by an array of solid rocket motor boosters on the first stage, procedures similar to those used by Delta will be adopted.
In the case of Titan-3 and Titan-4, the second stage is burned to depletion after payload separation and the collision contamination avoidance manoeuvre is conducted, generally to de-orbit the stage.
The upper stage then has to take measures to minimize debris.
The predominant upper stage is the Centaur mentioned above.
The other United States upper stages that can be used, the payload assist module (PAM-D2), Transtage, inertial upper stage (IUS) and transfer orbit stage (TOS), have not flown, or been scheduled to fly, since debris avoidance manoeuvres have been required, so no explicit procedures have been defined.
Transtage has restart capability, so it could use procedures similar to Delta or Centaur stages.
The others are all solid rocket motors and have limited capability to manoeuvre with attitude control system after payload separation.
The French space agency Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES), together with Arianespace, started residual fuel venting from the upper stage of the Ariane launcher in the case of launches into low-altitude circular orbits (e.g. the satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT-2), the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) and Topex/Poseidon satellites) to prevent explosions.
Since flight V-59, fuel venting of the third stage is routinely carried out regardless of the type of the target orbit.
Future CNES debris mitigation policies include the following:
(a) The launcher may leave in orbit a maximum of one inert object (debris) per satellite launched;
(b) All objects left in orbit (whatever the orbit may be) must be made fully passive to prevent any further explosions after the end of the mission.
Active elements such as batteries or tanks containing residual propellant must reach a fully inert state after delivering the satellites to orbit;
(c) Last stage separations must be clean and explosive bolts and clamps must be trapped to avoid operational debris;
(d) Solid propellant perigee kick motors that release aluminium particles are to be avoided;
(e) All other stages must naturally re-enter the atmosphere or be de-orbited.
A special release system has been developed for the upper stage of the Chinese Long March 4 launcher.
This system is designed to release, after separation of the satellite, the residual propellant from the tank and the residual gas from the high-pressure container in the booster, in order to avert the danger of in-orbit disintegration of the upper stage.
The de-orbiting technology will be used on the improved Long March 2 launcher to make possible the earlier re-entry of its upper stage.
There are different types of orbital objects; the largest number of such objects are fragment debris created by explosions.
In order to avoid significant accidental debris creation, the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan has implemented provisions for the draining of residual propellants (liquid oxygen (LOX), liquid hydrogen (LH2), N2H4) and the residual helium gas of the H-I and H-II second stage.
The release of mechanical devices at satellite separation and solar paddle deployment has been avoided except in certain missions, such as the separation of spent apogee motor for the geostationary meteorological satellite.
For the purpose of the prevention of unintended destruction of the H-II second stage in space, the command destruct system is disabled immediately after injection into orbit and its pyrotechnics are thermally insulated to preclude spontaneous initiation.
NASA has been conducting studies to determine how a requirement to de-orbit objects might be implemented in a cost-effective manner.
In general, lowering the perigee of the orbit, so that the orbital life is 25 years or less, is adequate to protect the future environment.
Such a manoeuvre is effective because, with the lower perigee subject to drag, the apogee quickly migrates out of the region of greatest risk and the risk during the prolonged decay is minimal.
For flight planning and mission management purposes, it is proposed to integrate this requirement with the other variables used in calculating the current flight performance reserve.
Because of variance in the actual flight performance, the residuals available for the manoeuvre may not achieve the desired reduction in every instance, but on average the goal will be met.
Clearly it is necessary for all operators to adopt such a practice concurrently because there is no significant effect if it is adopted only by one operator.
A large company in the United States that is responsible for development of the Iridium constellation of 66 small communications satellites has included provisions for debris mitigation in the very first phases of its programme.
In the original operations concept, the most important provision was the de-orbiting of spent spacecraft.
The concept also called for selection of orbits that minimized the collision hazard both with the company's own spacecraft and with other objects, while minimizing debris associated with insertion and deployment.
Subsequent updates of the concept have dealt with the explosion hazard and the need for the spacecraft itself to be implementing mitigation techniques autonomously.
In particular, the nominal orbits of satellites in the constellation have been adjusted to provide for miss distances greater than 100 km at the polar region (where all orbits are intersecting).
Also, based on input from various suppliers, nickel-hydrogen batteries and hydrazine fuel have been identified as the only explosion hazards, and provisions have been made to minimize that kind of failure.
The procedures for the operational phase of the Iridium project include supporting software that will direct (under specific conditions) the spacecraft to execute fuel-depleting and perigee-lowering burns with whatever capability it can use.
The procedures emphasize the need for ailing spacecraft to be taken out of the operational orbit and "safed" with regard to explosion hazard.
The operator of the Iridium system has agreed to the de-orbiting philosophy, which can occasionally result in de-orbiting perfectly healthy spacecraft because the fuel remaining is only enough for de-orbiting.
Debris removal options have been used on a few occasions to date, such as retrieval via the United States Space Shuttle or de-orbiting.
In the manned space programme of the Russian Federation, as in the manned space programme of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, debris removal has been used consistently through the de-orbiting of the Progress supply vehicles and ageing orbital stations into oceanic areas (except Cosmos 557, Salyut 2 and the Salyut 7/Cosmos 1686 stations).
Most re-entering spacecraft and upper stages have been destroyed by entry heating.
In rare cases (Skylab, Cosmos 954 and the Salyut 7/Cosmos 1686 stations), some solid pieces have reached the surface of Earth.
According to a debris mitigation study conducted in China, no measures are required at the design stage for those parts and components of satellites and launcher stages that either do not enter into outer space orbit or are capable of returning to the atmosphere soon after their entry.
For parts and components sent into an orbit with a longer orbital lifetime, it is necessary to take measures to tether them with the main object in order not to produce more debris.
Whenever possible, China is using recoverable satellites for carrying out scientific experiments in outer space, thereby reducing the number of jettisoned satellites in orbit.
Efforts are also being made to improve satellites and launchers in terms of design, launching technique and reliability.
In order to minimize the creation of space debris, the Canadian Radarsat programme has established a system-level requirement that any solid debris resulting from the operation of a restraint/release mechanism must be contained; that is, all contractors are required to design systems in which no debris is released by the spacecraft during its deployment in orbit.
During the operational lifetime of the planned Envisat spacecraft of the European Space Agency (ESA), the creation of mission-related objects will be precluded.
At end-of-life, the controlled venting of pressure vessels and residual fuel, discharging of batteries and shutting down of the power system are foreseen. III. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF THE GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) has adopted the following practices to minimize the creation of space debris in the region of geostationary orbits (GSO):
(a) At the end of their operational lifetimes, INTELSAT will boost its communication satellites into an orbit at least 150 km above the geostationary arc.
The intended increase in orbit will be 300 km for the INTELSAT-VI and all later satellite series;
(b) INTELSAT will discourage manufacturers of its spacecraft from using designs that jettison spacecraft parts, especially near GSO.
For example, solid rocket motor casings and solar array cable wraps will stay attached to the spacecraft.
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognizes the unique nature of the geosynchronous altitude and the need to preserve this global resource for future development and exploitation.
Consequently, the Skynet family of geosynchronous communications satellites controlled by the United Kingdom have the following operational requirements:
(a) For all satellites that are currently in orbit, a fuel budget is allocated that is capable of performing a tri-impulse manoeuvre to a circular orbit with a minimum altitude of 150 km above the geostationary ring at the end of operational life;
(b) Design requirements for future series of satellites specify a capability to achieve a minimum altitude of 500 km above the geostationary ring using a similar tri-impulse manoeuvre at the end of operational life.
In all cases, in order to eliminate the potential for explosion, appropriate operational procedures will be established to make passive all energetic subsystems when the satellite has been placed in a graveyard orbit.
The following ESA geostationary satellites have been re-orbited: OTS-2 (orbiting 318 km above GSO), GEOS-2 (260 km), Meteosat-2 (334 km), ECS-2 (335 km) and Olympus-1 (due to a failure, this satellite has been left at orbit 213 km below GSO).
Similarly, the unusable meteorological satellites of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series are put into disposal orbit and deactivated by their operator, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States.
The NOAA policy is to boost them into a "super-synchronous" orbit, at least 250 km above GSO, depleting all remaining fuel and minimizing the threat to other spacecraft in GSO.
After the boost or disposal phase is complete, the spacecraft are then electronically deactivated by sending commands to turn off all communication down-links, battery under-voltage protection circuitry, and telemetry subsystems.
Using this procedure the SMS-1 satellite was put into disposal orbit 500 km above GSO, SMS-2 about 245 km above GSO and GOES-4 about 277 km above GSO.
The GOES-1, GOES-5 and GOES-6 satellites were used operationally with no replacements available until they depleted their fuel in GSO.
Those satellites have been left in the GSO region, but have also been deactivated.
NOAA plans to conserve enough fuel on future operational meteorological GOES satellites to perform boost manoeuvres.
The current GOES I-M spacecraft series includes a de-orbit fuel supply in addition to the nominal five-year operational fuel supply.
The number of objects in the geostationary transfer orbits (GTO) is increasing and is considered to be hazardous to future space activities because of their long orbital life.
An effort is currently being made in Japan to decrease the orbital life of the second stage of the H-II launcher.
The second stage (1994-056B) of the H-II second flight of 28 August 1994, for instance, was de-orbited from GTO with an apogee of 36,346 km and a perigee of 251 km to the orbit with an apogee of 32,298 km and a perigee of 150 km by performing idle mode burn and depleting residual propellants.
It was observed that the second stage had, by 31 March 1995, fragmented into at least six new objects, which have decayed since then.
NASDA has, since 1985, also re-orbited GSO satellites after end-of-life at least 150 km upward, aiming at 300 km.
IV. DEBRIS PROTECTION OF ACTIVE SPACECRAFT Measures were taken to protect the Canadian Radarsat spacecraft, successfully launched on 4 November 1995, from the existing space debris environment.
Such measures were necessary in order to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the Radarsat spacecraft would not prematurely become space debris as a result of a space debris impact.
The space debris environment to be encountered by Radarsat was defined using the ENVIRONET database of NASA.
Individual spacecraft components were then examined to determine their vulnerability to that predicted environment.
The vulnerability assessment included using hypervelocity impact equations, as well as actually subjecting spacecraft hardware to hypervelocity impact tests at the NASA Johnson Space Center.
Where required, shielding was added to the spacecraft in order to bring the survivability of the spacecraft to an acceptable level.
The shielding included adding Nextel (a ceramic fibre cloth) to thermal blankets, adding bumpers in front of exposed hydrazine lines and wire bundles, and thickening some component boxes in order to protect their enclosed circuits. The planned ESA module of the International Space Station will be shielded in order to withstand the impact of particles of about 1 cm.
The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA), which has observer status with the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, initiated a study on orbital debris, which was prepared by an ad hoc expert group of its Committee on Safety, Rescue and Quality.
The objectives were to evaluate the need and urgency for action and to indicate ways to reduce the hazards posed by such debris.
(a) No deliberate breakup of spacecraft that produces debris in long-lived orbits;
(b) Minimization of mission-related debris;
(c) "Safing" (venting) procedures for all rocket bodies and spacecraft that remain in orbit after completion of their mission;
(d) Selection of transfer orbit parameters to ensure the rapid decay of transfer stages;
(e) Re-orbiting of geostationary satellites at end-of-life (minimum altitude increase of 300-400 km);
(f) Separated apogee boost motors used for geostationary satellites should be inserted into a disposal orbit at least 300 km above the geostationary orbit;
(g) Upper stages used to move geostationary satellites from GTO to GSO should be inserted into a disposal orbit at least 300 km above the geostationary orbit and freed of residual propellant.

INTRODUCTION At its thirty-second session, held at Vienna from 6 to 17 February 1995, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) reviewed the activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The Subcommittee noted that the 1994 activities of the Programme had been carried out satisfactorily, and that upon the recommendation of COPUOS the activities scheduled for 1995 had been endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.
The Subcommittee recommended to COPUOS, for its approval, the activities scheduled for 1996 under the regular budget, and took note of other activities of the Programme, all of which are to be implemented as part of the space-applications-related recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), as proposed by the Expert on Space Applications in his annual report (A/AC.105/595) submitted to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its 1995 session.
The present report reviews the steps taken to date to translate the mandate of the Programme into operational activities.
I. MANDATE OF THE PROGRAMME
The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, took into account the recommendations of UNISPACE 82, and expanded the mandate of the Programme to include, in particular, the following elements: (a) provision of assistance in the development of indigenous capability at the local level; (b) provision of long-range fellowships for in-depth training; (c) provision of technical advisory services to Member States and regional institutions upon request; (d) organization of regional and international training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences and technical expert meetings for the benefit of specialists, educators, managers and decision makers in order to enhance their technical capabilities and keep them abreast of ongoing developments in the discipline; (e) acquisition and dissemination of space-related information; and (f) promotion of greater cooperation between developed and developing countries, as well as among developing countries.
Presented below are summaries of the activities carried out within the mandate of the Programme in 1995, those scheduled for implementation in 1996 and those proposed for 1997.
A. Development of indigenous capability
A major prerequisite to successful space technology applications, in the developing countries, is the development of various essential indigenous capacities, particularly human resources, within each region.
In recognition of such a prerequisite, the General Assembly, in its resolution 45/72 of 11 December 1990, endorsed the recommendation of COPUOS that:
A progress report (A/AC.105/498) on the establishment of the centres was prepared in early 1992.
An updated project document (A/AC.105/534) on the same subject was issued in January 1993.
A booklet entitled "Centres for space science and technology education - Education curricula", prepared by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and currently under peer review, will be published in 1996.
1. Goal of the centres
Each centre is conceived as an institution that should offer the best possible education, research and applications programmes, opportunities and experience to the participants in all its programmes.
Thus the principal goal of each centre is the development of the skills and knowledge of university educators and research and applications scientists, through rigorous theory, research, applications, field exercises, and pilot projects in those aspects of space science and technology that can contribute to sustainable development in each country.
2. Programme of the centres
The initial programmes of each centre should focus on (a) remote sensing and geographic information systems, (b) meteorological satellite applications, (c) satellite communications and geopositioning systems, and (d) space and atmospheric sciences.
Its data management unit should be linked to existing and future relevant global databases.
Each centre should also foster continuing education programmes for its graduates and awareness programmes for policy and decision makers and for the general public.
The activities at each centre will be undertaken in two major phases.
Phase 1 will emphasize the development and enhancement of the knowledge and skills of university educators and research and application scientists in both the physical and natural sciences as well as in analytical disciplines.
That will be accomplished over a nine-month period as laid out in the curricula of the education programme of each centre.
Phase 2 will focus on ensuring that the participants make use of the skills and knowledge gained in phase 1 in their pilot projects, which are to be conducted, over a one-year period, in their own countries.
The activities and opportunities provided in the two phases should result in the development and growth of capacities that will enable each country to enhance its knowledge, understanding, and practical experience in those aspects of space science and technology that have the potential for a greater impact on its economic and social development, including the preservation of its environment.
3. The participating scholars
The importance of having a sound academic background, experience and an aptitude for engaging in the different activities of the centre cannot be overstressed.
Being highly qualified in those three respects would have a positive impact on the performance of the applicant at the centre.
In order for the centres to become model institutions that are respected both within their regions and around the world, they would need to meet internationally recognized standards.
To promote the achievement of those aims, the United Nations and the Government of Spain, in early 1995, jointly organized a workshop to draw up model curricula for the centres (see paragraph 4).
The model curricula provide the centres with a benchmark of the level of academic performance needed to meet the standards required to achieve international recognition.
4. Responsibilities of participating countries to the scholars
Of equal importance is the future of the participating scholars in their own countries upon completion of their studies at the centres.
It should be emphasized that the overall mission of the centres is to assist participating countries in developing and enhancing the knowledge and skills of their people in relevant aspects of space science and technology, so that returning scholars can effectively contribute to national development programmes.
To provide suitable employment for the returning scholars, the sponsoring Governments or institutions would need to promote development-oriented activities that make use of their newly acquired knowledge and skills, to establish appropriate infrastructure, and to make the necessary arrangements for their careers on a long-term basis.
The sponsoring Governments would also need to ensure that returning scholars remain employed, with appropriate levels of remuneration and benefits, for a minimum of 3 to 5 years.
5. Operation of the centres
Once a host country is identified for the centre in a given region, the process of inaugurating and establishing the centre, including its governing board, is set in motion by the host country itself.
The governing board is the general policy-making body of the centre, overseeing all aspects of its activities. It is composed of representatives of those States of the region in which the centre is established that have agreed to its goals and objectives, through their endorsement of the agreement that establishes the centre, and are fully committed to work, in cooperation with other States of the region, for the success of the centre.
A governing board thus constituted is necessary for each centre, because the member States and their citizens are more familiar with their own specific needs, aspirations, capabilities and resources, and better equipped to find solutions to any local problems that may arise.
Since the General Assembly, in its resolution 45/72, specifically limits the role of the United Nations to leading international efforts to establish the centres, the governing board, once the location of a centre is determined, will assume all powers of decision-making and policy formulation for the centre.
Moreover, as the centre will have arisen through the efforts of the United Nations, the latter, together with the relevant regional economic commission, will serve the centre and its governing board in an advisory capacity.
6. Location of the centres
(a) Africa
After careful consideration of all the offers and commitments made by six potential host countries for centres in Africa, a favourable response was given to proposals for ensuring the early establishment, operation and long-term viability of a centre in Morocco for the countries of French-speaking Africa, and in Nigeria for those of English-speaking Africa.
On 15 September 1995, both countries were invited to undertake the necessary steps for the establishment of the centres.
The statement made by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in that connection is contained in annex I to the present report.
(b) Asia and the Pacific
On 1 November 1995, the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in the Asia and the Pacific region was inaugurated at New Delhi with the signing of an agreement by 10 countries of the region.
The first meeting of the Governing Board of the Centre was held at New Delhi on 2 November 1995.
Representatives of a number of countries that were still awaiting the necessary clearance from their Governments on the signing of the agreement attended the meeting as observers.
All States of the region were invited to sign the agreement, join the Governing Board, and participate in the activities of the Centre.
The first group of scholars will be admitted to the Centre in early 1996.
(c) Latin America and the Caribbean
At the 17th and 18th meetings of the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, held in November 1995, Brazil and Mexico informed the Committee that they had both reached agreement on all aspects relating to the establishment of a centre.
The only pending issues were the modalities and scope for affiliation with the United Nations.
(d) Western Asia
Negotiations are in progress with the parties concerned on the establishment of a regional centre.
7. Affiliation with the United Nations
Following a review of the work of the Fourth Committee, the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995, endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that "these centres be established on the basis of affiliation to the United Nations as early as possible and that such affiliation would provide the centres with the necessary recognition and would strengthen the possibilities of attracting donors and of establishing academic relationship with national and international space-related institutions".
B. Long-term fellowship programmes for in-depth training The Programme received 15 long-term fellowship offers for 1995/96 from the Government of Brazil (10), as well as from the European Space Agency (ESA) (5).
The status of the awards for 1995/96 is reflected in annex III to the present report.
The awards cover monthly allowances for room and board, books, local travel and health benefits.
The fellowship programmes offered are described below in further detail.
The 10 long-term fellowships offered by the Government of Brazil are for research and applications in remote sensing technology, and are tenable at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, Brazil.
The five ESA long-term fellowships are each for a period of one year of research and study at ESA institutions and in the disciplines described below:
(a) One fellowship in space antennas and propagation, one in communications systems and one in remote sensing instrumentation, each tenable at the European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, Netherlands;
(b) Two fellowships in remote sensing information systems, tenable at the European Space Research Institute, Frascati, Italy.
The fellowship awards for 1996/97 were advertised in December 1995.
Selected candidates will begin their studies in September 1996 at the above-mentioned ESA institutions.
The Programme is now entering a phase that will be devoted to the expanded provision of technical advisory services.
The latter is fuelled by the following four factors:
(a) The developmental support needed for the centres for space science and technology education;
(b) Advances in communications technology and related information systems, and in the technology of earth observation systems, particularly microwave remote sensing, and the need to prepare Member States for this new phase of Earth observation;
(c) Follow-up projects that have resulted from different activities of the Programme;
(d) Increasing requests for the services of the Programme by national and regional entities.
Various technical advisory services currently being rendered under the auspices of the Programme are described below.
1. COTOPAXI
As a follow-up to the Workshop on Space Technology for Resource Development and Environmental Management, jointly organized by the United Nations and the Government of Japan and held at Quito in 1992, the Programme has been cooperating since 1993 with the Junta del Acuerdo de Cartagena and the Corporaci√≥n Andina de Fomento, bodies established by the Governments of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, as well as with the Caribbean Community, to establish a Multinational Andean Enterprise.
The pre-feasibility study on the establishment of a multinational Andean organization that will facilitate the operation and utilization of the COTOPAXI ground station and its services has been completed.
The International Technical Commission of the Andean group was scheduled to meet in early 1996 to consider the action to be taken on the basis of the study.
2. Africa: a cooperative information network
Within the framework of the Programme, the Office for Outer Space Affairs has responded to a recommendation on the establishment of efficient communication links between African scientists and professionals, adopted at a regional conference organized by the United Nations and held at Dakar in 1993, with a proposal to establish a Cooperative Information Network Linking Scientists, Educators and Professionals in Africa, known as COPINE.
Through the implementation of a satellite-based information system, the immediate aim of COPINE would be to improve the collection, transmission, distribution and exchange of information, particularly in such areas as health care, agricultural research and development, management of natural resources and the environment, education and science and technology.
In any of the participating countries, the COPINE system could be developed to include capabilities for electronic mail services such as Internet and for voice communications (subject to approval by the local post, telegraph and telephone service).
The primary focus of COPINE, however, is the use of its wideband capabilities to provide a variety of information delivery services, particularly computer file transfer, interactive data transfer, document transmission, and imagery and video transmissions, including video conferencing, distant learning and telemedicine.
The Office of Outer Space Affairs planned to send, in late January 1996, an evaluation mission on user needs to the targeted countries that have confirmed their readiness to participate in the project.
The report on the mission will be used to finalize the COPINE project document, which will subsequently be submitted for consideration to potential contributors in March 1996.
The United Nations, through the Department of Development Support and Management Services, the Office for Outer Space Affairs and the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, and ESA have followed up a previous request and jointly initiated a technical assistance programme that would strengthen the capability of a number of institutions in developing countries.
The technical assistance programme would make it possible for the institutions of the participants in the series of training courses to obtain satellite, radar and optical data to support ongoing projects in their countries, as well as hands-on training in the use of such data.
Where necessary, the programme would also provide software modules and possibly hardware components so that the data could be fully utilized.
In addition to the training and practical results that would directly benefit those who participate in the technical assistance programme, one of its main objectives is to enable the participants to demonstrate to their decision makers, in management terms, the cost-effectiveness of utilizing satellite data and to highlight the value and impact that such information could have in the planning and management of future projects.
Data needs of several ongoing projects have been submitted to the United Nations and ESA by participants in the first two training courses held at the ESA European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) at Frascati, Italy.
The first series of submissions have come from Latin America, and have been integrated thematically into modules which the co-sponsors will present to potential contributors.
A similar process is currently under way for Africa through input that is being received from participants in other courses jointly organized by the United Nations and ESA in the region, in particular the training course held in 1995 on the use of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) data for the mapping and inventory of resources in Africa (see paragraphs 46-50).
The technical assistance programme is to be subsequently extended to include regional commissions of the United Nations through participation in courses organized by the United Nations and ESA at Frascati and elsewhere.
4. Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications was closely associated with the Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC) from its conception in 1992, through its gestation period, to its birth at Seoul in October 1994.
APSCC was established to address a number of concerns within the Asia-Pacific region, among which are the following needs:
(a) To promote cooperation and harmonization in the development and utilization of satellite communications in the region;
(b) To facilitate access to information by island States, and to enhance regional cooperation;
(c) To bridge the gaps between groups with competing interests, particularly those institutions or organizations which are mostly interested in the technical and business aspects of telecommunications.
According to its proponents, APSCC should champion the provision of satellite services to rural areas in the region, and also play a leading role on a number of technical and regulatory issues in order to achieve an integrated information infrastructure in the region.
Through the commitment of its members and the support of the international community, APSCC can assist the region in facing the opportunities and challenges ahead.
As of 31 October 1995, membership of APSCC had grown to 40, and had spread from the Asia-Pacific geographical area to Europe and North America.
At its session held in 1995, the Council of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approved the application of APSCC for membership and added APSCC to its list of international organizations (ITU "Notification No. 1332", dated 10 July 1995).
Since 1991, the Programme has been conducting a series of annual workshops on basic space science that have addressed a variety of topics, including the worldwide development of planetary exploration and astronomy, which are two items on the agenda of the Committee.
The workshops focus in particular on education, research and cooperation as prerequisites for the development of space science and technology capabilities at the national, regional and international levels.
The reports of the workshops, which were held in India (1991), Colombia and Costa Rica (1992), Nigeria (1993) and Egypt (1994), are contained in documents A/AC.105/489, A/AC.105/530, A/AC.105/560 and A/AC.105/580, respectively.
Projects that have resulted from the deliberations of the workshops, and which are enhancing regional and international cooperation, include the following:
(a) The inauguration in Sri Lanka, in January 1996, of an astronomical telescope donated by Japan;
(b) The operation of an astronomical observatory in Honduras;
(c) The development of an Inter-African Astronomical Observatory and Science Park on the Gamsberg in Namibia;
(d) The upgrading of the Kottamia Observatory in Egypt.
D. Training courses, workshops, conferences and symposia organized by the United Nations
1. Activities carried out in 1995
In 1995, one expert group meeting, three training courses, three workshops, one symposium and one conference were conducted under the auspices of the Programme.
A summary of each of those activities is given in annex II to the present report.
2. Activities scheduled for implementation in 1996
The training courses and workshops scheduled for 1996 are shown in annex III.
3. Activities proposed for implementation in 1997
The following training courses and conferences are proposed for 1997:
(a) Seventh United Nations/Sweden International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators;
(b) Second United Nations Workshop on Payloads on Small Satellites;
(c) United Nations International Training Course on Communications and Information Technology for Development;
(d) Fourth United Nations/ESA Training Course on ERS Data Applications;
(e) A United Nations workshop on space technology as a tool for cleaning up and rehabilitating the environment.
The implementation of the above-mentioned activities may be affected by the decision of the General Assembly on the organization of a third United Nations conference on the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space.
The 1996 edition of Seminars of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, the seventh in the series of selected papers from the activities of the Programme, has been issued as document A/AC.105/621.
II. VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
The successful implementation of the activities of the Programme in 1995 benefited from the support and voluntary contributions of Member States of the United Nations and their institutions, as well as from the assistance and cooperation of regional and other international governmental and non-governmental organizations.
In 1995, the Programme received voluntary contributions, both in money and in kind, including the sponsorship of technical and scientific presentations by several experts, as described below.
A number of Member States (Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Gabon, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and Zimbabwe) and governmental and non-governmental organizations (Department of Development Support and Management Services, Department of Humanitarian Affairs, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, International Telecommunication Union, Commission of the European Communities, ESA, GlobalStar, Inter-American Development Bank, International Centre for Theoretical Physics, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Maritime Satellite Organization, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, Nippon Electric Company, Nuova Telespazio, Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) provided support for the activities of the Programme in 1995 in various ways, including the following:
(a) Defrayal of the local expenses of candidates from developing countries in the long-term fellowship programmes (see paragraph 19 and annex II);
(b) Voluntary cash contributions of $20,000 were received in 1995 from the Government of Austria in support of the activities of the Programme, and of $25,000 from the Government of Spain in support of the Meeting of Experts on the Development of Education Curricula, held at Granada, Spain, from 27 February to 3 March 1995;
(c) A financial contribution of $100,000 was received from ESA in support of the workshop, training course and conference held at Libreville, Harare and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as well as the Workshop on Basic Space Science rescheduled to take place at Colombo in January 1996;
(d) Co-sponsorship of the activities of the Programme and, in particular, the defrayal of the costs of international air travel of participants, local organization and facilities, room and board, and local transportation (see annex II);
(e) Sponsorship (travel and daily subsistence allowance) of experts from Member States to make technical presentations and take part in deliberations on the activities of the Programme (see annex II).
III. RESULTS OF THE IMPACT OF THE UNITED NATIONS/SWEDEN TRAINING
COURSES ON REMOTE SENSING EDUCATION FOR EDUCATORS
HELD IN 1990, 1992 AND 1993 In order to assist in adjusting the scope of an activity organized by the Programme and to determine whether a particular activity is geared towards the development of capabilities in a given country, the Office of Outer Space Affairs seeks the views of those who have participated in the activities of the Programme.
To respond effectively to the needs of the international community, the co-sponsors of the annual United Nations/Sweden course on remote sensing education for educators decided to seek the views of those who participated in the course on the impact of the training programme on their performance and on productivity in their home countries.
A questionnaire was sent to the participants in the courses held in 1990, 1992 and 1993, as it was felt that sufficient time had passed for them to judge the impact of the course.
Out of 75 participants, a total of 53 replied.
The participants were educators from African, Asian and Latin American institutions.
The responses have been collated and summarized in document A/AC.105/616.
The overall response of the participants has been very positive.
The responses demonstrated that the course has enhanced indigenous capabilities, particularly in remote sensing, in many countries.
IV. FINANCIAL PROVISIONS AND ADMINISTRATION OF ACTIVITIES IN 1996
The activities of the Programme in 1996 covered in the present report will be implemented as follows:
(a) Financial provisions.
Under the United Nations regular budget, a sum of $446,200 was approved by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session for implementing the activities of the Programme during the biennium 1996-1997.
In order to effectively carry out its mandated and expanded activities, it has become necessary for the Programme to solicit additional funds, in the form of voluntary contributions, in support of its activities.
Those contributions will be used to supplement the regular budget of the Programme;
(b) Administration by and contributions and participation of staff.
The Office for Outer Space Affairs, and in particular the Expert on Space Applications and his staff, will carry out the activities described in the present report.
In that connection, travel will be undertaken as appropriate by the Expert and his staff under the provisions of the travel budget of the Office for the biennium, as approved by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session, and as necessary from voluntary contributions;
(c) Consultations, instructors, speakers and technical materials.
Up to 30 specialists (necessitated, in particular, by the work associated with the establishment and operation of the regional centres for space science and technology education) will be required to serve as instructors, speakers and consultants during the implementation of the activities of the Programme in 1996.
Expenses incurred in respect of the travel and per diem of the specialists and for necessary technical materials will be met partly from the regular budget and partly from voluntary contributions received from Member States and international organizations.
Annex I
ESTABLISHMENT AND LOCATIONS OF THE CENTRES FOR SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN AFRICA
Statement by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United NationsThis text has been reproduced without formal editing.
The objective of these Centres is to enhance the capabilities of member States, including those in Africa, in different areas of space science and technology, capabilities that can advance their social and economic development.
Thus, each of the Centres will provide in-depth education, research and applications programmes with initial emphasis on remote sensing, satellite communications, satellite meteorology, geo-positioning systems and atmospheric sciences, for university educators, research and application scientists.
The concept of the Centre calls for it to offer the best possible education, research and applications experience to the participants in its programme.
Permanent and visiting staff from countries both within and outside the region would contribute to the attainment of these elements of the Centre's programme.
This proposal was presented to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) through its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at their 1990 sessions.
2. On 11 December 1990, in its resolution 45/72, the General Assembly endorsed the Committee's recommendation that "the United Nations should lead, with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations, an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national/regional educational institutions in the developing countries".
3. In translating the decision contained in the above resolution of the General Assembly into an operational programme, the Office for Outer Space Affairs (herein referred to as the Office), requested a timely indication, by all member States in Africa, of their interest to host such a Centre in the region.
Six countries (Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe) responded and offered to host such a Centre, one for the English speaking and one for the French speaking countries of Africa.
4. The Office took three steps in order to identify the host countries for these Centres.
These steps included the following:
(a) In, March/April 1993, two United Nations evaluation missions, consisting of two teams of experts, respectively went to the above anglophone and francophone African countries.
Each of these missions met with Government and institutional representatives and in each case conducted a detailed analysis of the elements offered by each of the six potential host countries.
These elements included the physical infrastructure (i.e. academic, research and living facilities), financial support, equipment available on a dedicated or shared basis, existing space science and technology-related education programmes and experience, the degree to which the proposed concept of the Centre could be fulfilled, the level of governmental and institutional support that would be provided for the Centre, existing/planned communications systems, administrative and academic autonomy offered to the Centre, local expertise and experience available to the Centre, and language (vis a vis the rest of the region).
(b) At the request of the Office, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) recommended four experts, who reviewed the reports of the missions.
These experts made their recommendations to the Office .
Their analyses of the reports of the evaluation missions showed that a number of essential elements that are necessary to sustain the Centres were not fully addressed in the submissions provided by most of the countries visited; and
(c) Accordingly, on 31 March 1995, the Office for Outer Space Affairs requested each of the six potential host countries to provide by 30 June, 1995:
(i) Details of the role of in-country academic and research institutions and associated centre(s) in the work programme of the proposed Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Africa, including the brochures and booklets showing the academic and research programmes of such institutions;
(ii) A detailed financial plan being offered by each country that will ensure the long-term sustainability of the Centre; and
(iii) The vision of each country for this Centre, and its plan for ensuring that, if located within its territory, the Centre will serve the overall interest of all the countries (anglophone or francophone) in Africa.
5. The overall (a) offers and commitments of each of these six countries in support of these Centres, (b) the reports of the evaluation missions, and (c) the recommendations of the experts proposed by ECA, all showed that in order to attain its objectives, a Centre for Space Science and Technology Education be established in Morocco for the benefit of Africa's francophone countries, and a Centre for Space Science and Technology Education be established in Nigeria, for the benefit of Africa's anglophone countries.
The afore-mentioned offers and commitments of both Morocco and Nigeria assure, in each case, (i) an early establishment of each of these Centres, in these two countries, and (ii) their long-term sustainability.
6. Coordination of the programmes of each of these two Centres will be carried out by its Governing Board which will be regional in its composition. The Governing Board of each Centre is its overall policy making body; it will oversee all aspects of the Centre including the adoption of its academic programme, and determination of its budget, personnel, and future direction.
The Office for Outer Space Affairs will be requesting both Morocco and Nigeria, the host countries of these Centres to each develop, expeditiously, a draft agreement to be discussed, adopted and entered into by all the francophone participating countries, in the case of Morocco, and by all the anglophone participating countries, in the case of Nigeria.
Each of these draft agreements shall embody such issues as the specific goals and objectives of each Centre and the structure of its personnel and Governing Board, such as contained in UN document A/AC.105/534 of 7 January 1993, and shall include provisions for the future direction of each of these two Centres as regional institutions.

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER
ARTICLE 18 OF THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL
Third and fourth periodic reports of States parties
1. The Government of the Republic of Peru hereby submits its report for the period 1990 to 1994, which describes in detail far-reaching structural reforms carried out since the submission of the previous reports.
These reforms concern the country's legal order and are expressed in new legislative, judicial and administrative measures to chart the Nation's future, in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
2. Peru has unswervingly maintained its position in the various national and international fora of total rejection of any type of discrimination against women and of firm support for any initiative aimed at eliminating any form of discrimination.
3. In this line of thinking, the Peruvian State bases itself on equality before the law, with no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion, economic or any other status.
In other words, equitable treatment of women and men, of residents of urban as well as of rural areas, irrespective of their socioeconomic condition.
4. The Peruvian Government's current concerns centre in making it possible for men and women to work together to achieve equality, development and peace.
II. LAND AND PEOPLE
A. General characteristics of the country
5. Peru is located in the southern hemisphere, in the central western part of South America.
Its coasts extend along the Pacific Ocean.
Since the entire country is located in the tropical zone, its climate should be hot and humid; however, the existence of various geographical accidents and features - the Andes, high-pressure movement of air masses from the South Pacific, Humboldt Current, etc. - makes the Peruvian territory geographically complex, not only from a climatic standpoint, but also from the morphological, geological, ecological and economic standpoints.
6. The total area of Peruvian territory is 1,285,216.60 square kilometres.
Peru is bounded to the west by the Pacific Ocean and has a coastline of 3,079.5 kilometres.
It is also bounded by five South American countries: Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil and Bolivia to the east, and Chile to the south.
Peru respects international law and faithfully complies with the international treaties that lay down its geographical limits.
7. Peru is divided into regions, departments, provinces and districts.
According to Supreme Decree No. 071-88-PCM, Single Uniform Text relating to the Fundamental Act on Regionalization, which governs procedures for the creation of regions, the territory of Peru is currently subdivided into 12 regions, 24 departments, 188 provinces and 1,793 districts.
8. The Andes mountain chain, where the Inca empire, one of the three most important cultural manifestations of the region, flourished, creates three natural regions: the coastal strip, the Sierra and the jungle.
The highest mountain is Nevado Huascar√°n, which stands 6,746 metres above sea level.
B. Ethnic and linguistic characteristics
9. Peru is a multi-ethnic country with a population made up of 72.62 per cent Spanish speakers and 27.38 per cent Quechua speakers.
Among the latter, approximately 16 per cent are bilingual (Spanish-Quechua), while only 3 per cent speak another indigenous language.
The country has between 64 and 67 ethno-linguistic groups.
10. The peasant and native communities number between 4,000 and 4,500.
Fifty-three per cent of these communities have Quechua as their mother tongue, 41 per cent Spanish, 4 per cent Aymara and 2 per cent other languages, including indigenous languages of the jungle.
11. Most of the indigenous communities are located in the Sierra region (98.9 per cent), primarily in the departments of Cuzco, Puno and Apur√≠mac in the south and in Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Jun√≠n and Pasco in the central area.
12. The more modernized indigenous communities are to be found in the departments of Pasco and Jun√≠n, an area noted for its mining enclaves, while the more traditional communities are located in relatively less developed areas, such as Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Apur√≠mac, Cusco and Puno.
13. One of the main features of the indigenous communities is farming.
A very important component of this priority economic activity is communal labour performed according to the principle of reciprocity, a form of labour that goes back to the Inca period and consists of an individual and equal exchange of services or goods, including agricultural labour, assistance, lending of tools, materials, etc.
It is also customary for one person to be assisted by many, with an obligation to reciprocate; this includes agricultural tasks and cooperation in various economic and social tasks.
14. The native communities are tribal groups in the jungle and jungle rim with clustered or dispersed settlements principally located in the departments of Loreto, Jun√≠n, Ucayali, Amazonas, Cusco and Madre de Dios.
They represent some 55 ethno-linguistic groups belonging to over 12 linguistic families, the largest being the Campas, Aguaruna and Shipibo-Conibo.
15. The native communities have developed agriculture as an activity to supplement hunting, fishing and gathering.
16. The native communities live in clearly identifiable ecological zones: tropical dry forest, subtropical rain forest and tropical rain forest scattered over large catchment areas.
The total or partial plundering of the flora and fauna and the serious effects of drug-trafficking on the environment place the self-defence of these communities at serious risk.
C. Demographic characteristics
17. Population censuses in Peru date back to the Inca period.
Subsequently, the first documented census was conducted by the Spaniards during the colonial era in 1548 and indicated a population of 8.3 million in the Viceroyalty of Peru.
During the Republican era, national censuses were held in 1836, 1850, 1862 and 1876.
The most recent censuses at the national level were conducted in 1940, 1961, 1972, 1981 and 1993.
18. On the basis of the 1981 census, it was estimated that the population of the country would be in the vicinity of 23 million in 1993.
According to the preliminary findings of the census held in July 1993, the population was 22,639,443.
This figure is made up of the nominally registered population (22,048,356), the population omitted from the register (531,543) and the population of the Native Communities of the Peruvian Amazon, which it is impossible to register on account of difficulties of access and isolation.
19. The urban population is 15,458,599, i.e. 70 per cent of the total, while the nominally registered population of rural towns and villages is 6,589,757, i.e. 29.9 per cent.
The 1993 census figures show that Peru's male population is 10,956,375, i.e. 49.7 per cent of the total, and its female population 11,091,981, i.e. 50.3% of the total.
20. The national demographic context between 1970 and 1990 reflected the principal characteristics of the world and regional demographic expansion, with unprecedented growth that reached its highest level at the end of the 1970s.
In those two decades the Peruvian population increased by 60 per cent, reaching 21,550,300, slightly less than the Latin American average, at the end of that period.
This population volume was attained during a period of the Peruvian demographic process when fertility, which had previously been maintaining high levels, was beginning to decline, causing the rate of population growth to decrease.
21. The most critical stage in this process occurred between 1961 and 1970, when demographic growth speeded up considerably, attaining an annual average rate of 2.8 per cent, higher than the Latin American average, and when, in addition, the highest growth rate in the country's history (2.9 per cent for the period 1961-1966) was attained.
From that time on, our population's relative growth rate fell steadily, declining to 2.1 per cent in 1990.
Despite this decrease, the total population is continuing to increase, considering that relatively speaking the increase between the 1981 and the 1993 census was 27.5 per cent, owing to the age structure of the population, which has a preponderance of younger age groups.
22. The greatest influence on these changes in the growth of the Peruvian population has undoubtedly been exerted by the variations in the birth and death rates, since emigration acquired relative significance only at the end of the period.
The gross birth rate, which was 42.4 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 1970, decreased to 29.8 in 1990, as a result of the drop in the global fertility rate which, until 1970, had been 6.2 children per woman, and which fell to 4.9 in 1980.
According to the 1993 census, the average number of live births per woman is 2.2.
This figure is lower than in the 1981 census, when it was 2.4.
23. Mortality has been falling in recent decades; between 1970 and 1990 the frequency of deaths declined from 13.5 to 8.2 per 1,000 inhabitants.
Similarly, the average life expectancy of our population grew by 9.4 years during that period, life expectancy at birth increasing from 54 years to 63.4 years.
The infant mortality rate showed a similar trend, dropping from 116 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 102 in 1981 and 81 in 1990.
24. It should be noted that, according to recent findings of the Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES 1990-1992), the infant mortality trend over the past two decades has been approximately 20 per cent lower than offical projections, which suggests that levels had been overestimated.
Nevertheless, infant mortality in Peru is still very high and continues to be above the Latin American average.
25. Despite the decrease in fertility mentioned earlier, the age structure of the Peruvian population will continue to be relatively young for several more years, and the number of minors will continue to increase.
From 1970 to 1990 the proportion of minors dropped from 44.7 per cent to 37.6 per cent, a relatively large decrease.
According to the 1993 census, over one third of the Peruvian population (37 per cent) is under 15, a percentage that has declined in comparison with previous censuses, but which continues to generate a critical demand for food products, health services, education, etc.
At the same time the percentage of persons aged between 15 and 64, which make up the potential labour force, has continued to increase, from 54.7 per cent in 1981 to 58.4 per cent in 1993.
In absolute terms the increase was 3,566,947.
26. The proportion of the population classified as "elderly", i.e. 65 and above, rose during the last 12 years from 692,680 (4.1 per cent) in 1981 to 1,026,119 (4.6 per cent) in 1993.
27. As regards population density, which shows the degree of concentration of the population, Peru is below the Latin American average (17.6 as against 22 inhabitants per km2).
Lima and the Constitutional Province of Callao have over 100 inhabitants per km2, while relatively large departments or those in or on the edge of the jungle, such as Pasco, Amazonas, Moquegua, Ucayali, Loreto and Madre de Dios, have less than 10 inhabitants per km2, which indicates that the population is still centrally concentrated.
D. Socio-economic indicators
28. The percentage of persons of working age rose from 51.8 in 1970 to 58.6 in 1990.
In absolute figures, this meant that the labour force nearly doubled, entailing a demand for the creation of an additional 283,000 jobs per year on average.
According to the 1993 census, Peru's economically active population (EAP) comes to 7,109,527, i.e. 51.2 per cent of the population of working age.
This category includes all people aged 15 and over.
According to this latest census, the economically inactive population amounts to 6,783,453, i.e. 48.8 per cent of the population of working age.
29. The 1993 census figures indicate that more women have joined the labour force.
From 25.5 per cent in 1981, their share rose to 29.7 per cent in 1993.
The male EAP fell during the same period from 79.7 to 73.4 per cent, although men still make up the bulk of the labour force.
30. In the economic sphere, over the past four decades total production and per capita production have not increased significantly.
From 1960 to 1990, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.7 per cent, very similar to the population growth rate, which was 2.8 per cent between 1961 and 1972 and 2.6 per cent between 1972 and 1981.
However, in the 1980s GDP dropped by an annual average rate of 0.6 per cent.
Thus, with the population growing at an average rate of 2.6 per cent between 1960 and 1990, per capita income decreased by an average of 0.03 per cent a year.
31. As a result of this demographic trend, together with the deterioration of the economic structure and its failure to meet the growing population's needs, which intensified in the 1980s, there was a steady decline in the quality of life of Peruvian families and a widespread increase in poverty.
It also contributed to an increase in violence, which has had serious consequences for society as a whole.
32. Not only did the insufficient growth in national production and the population increase combine to accentuate the deterioration in the quality of life, but the distribution of national income reached its highest levels of concentration precisely in the decade of the greatest economic recession.
Thus beginning in 1973, when wages attained 42.2 per cent of national income, they steadily decreased to 29.9 per cent of national income in 1988, the lowest level for the period.
33. The resulting fall in total investment, especially private investment, led - from the mid-1970s onwards - to a restriction in the expansion of modern productive activity, which could not continue to create sufficient employment.
34. Consequently, a high percentage of the population living in the cities and/or having migrated from rural areas created their own jobs, giving rise to a significant sector known as the self-employed, unstructured or informal urban sector.
According to 1981 estimates, this sector represented 60 per cent of the urban labour force, and by 1990 it had grown further.
The limitations on demand that restrict growth of the formal sector also affect the informal sector; consequently, the expansion of the informal sector, under the pressure of a growing labour supply due to population increase, ultimately causes the average income of its members to decline.
35. The changes in the production structure were accompanied by an urbanization process which, in recent decades, has oriented population distribution towards the major coastal cities, especially metropolitan Lima.
After 1960, the highest population growth rate occurred during the period 1961-1970 (2.8 per cent annual average), which also had the highest urbanization rate (5.1 per cent annual average).
According to the latest census, the population of Peru's urban centres is as much as 15,458,599, i.e. 70.1 per cent of the national population.
The registered population of Peru's rural population centres is 6,589,757, i.e. 29.9 per cent of the registered population.
These figures show that Peru's population continues to be concentrated in urban centres.
36. The growth of the urban population has not occurred as a result of the industrialization process.
The period in which the highest growth rate of the urban population occurred, 1961-1970, was not the period of highest growth of the industrial product or even of the total product.
It was the precarious rural situation, the result of the dearth of arable land per agricultural worker, the low investment in production infrastructure and the effective loss of capital investment characterizing agriculture for several decades that drove the rural population to the cities on a massive scale, giving rise to pockets of poverty in the main cities.
37. The migration and urbanization processess of the past 20 years have been characterized by a higher rate of growth of medium-sized cities as compared with metropolitan Lima.
These cities (departmental and provincial capitals) have achieved accelerated growth through migration from the countryside and expectations of finding greater advantages in medium-sized and small cities because of the emergence and vitality of the local and regional markets that make up urban systems in several areas of the country, such as the southern Andean region (Cusco, Sicuani, Juliaca, Puno), which is linked to a market extending into Bolivia, the northern coast (Piura, Sullana, Tumbes), the southern coast (Arequipa, Moquegua, Ilo, Tacna), and the jungle region (Pucallpa, Tarapoto, Moyobamba).
38. According to data from the ninth population and fourth housing censuses, 4,921,020 persons stated they were born in a different locality from their place of residence at the time of the census.
This figure represents 22.3 per cent of the registered population, 1.1 per cent of whom are aliens.
Most of the migrants moved to Lima, where they make up 36.7 per cent of the population.
39. Another factor contributing to the migration to medium-sized cities is displacement due to the indiscriminate violence perpetrated by terrorist groups.
These are forced displacements, people suddenly being obliged to leave their villages of origin or residence and their jobs.
40. Since the early 1980s, the phenomenon of violence-related displacement has affected at least two thirds of the national territory, substantially changing the demographic pattern of the regions and everyday living conditions.
Although it has not yet been possible to assess this phenomenon quantitatively, some 600,000 people (120,000 families) are estimated to have been affected.
41. Recent estimates indicate that approximately 54 per cent of persons displaced during the 12 years of terrorist violence have moved within their department, while the rest have migrated elsewhere.
The departments with the most displaced persons are Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Apur√≠mac and Junin.
The departments receiving the most displaced persons are Lima, Ica, Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac and Junin.
The latter three departments are areas both of expulsion and reception.
Ayacucho, the epicentre of the terrorist movement, is the department that produces the most internally displaced persons, most of whom belong to peasant communities.
Ayacucho is the department where the situation is the most critical, as it has both the highest expulsion and reception figures, with urban Ayacucho accommodating 30 per cent of all Peru's displaced persons.
42. There have been three major waves of internal displacement due to violence in Peru:
(a) 1983-1986: This period coincided with the outbreak of violence by "Sendero Luminoso" in the department of Ayacucho and the Government's first attempts to check it.
At that early stage displaced persons were mainly from Ayacucho and managed to find places for themselves, albeit with great difficulty, in the marginal zones of the capital cities;
(b) 1987-1989: Terrorist violence increased in response to anti-terrorist activity by the military, the first attempts at popular resistance with the formation of the self-defence "peasant patrols" and the successful initiative of self-managed grass-roots organizations opposed to violence;
(c) 1990-1992: A new migration flow arose as a result of the so-called "exemplary actions" and intensification of violence by "Sendero Luminoso".
43. The last two waves of migration have encountered conditions in the receiving areas that make permanent resettlement practically impossible, as virtually all of them have no other solution than to eke out a living in the informal sector, where they are compelled to perform poorly paid work in a highly competitive market.
The improved security they had hoped to find in the fringe urban areas proved elusive, conditions being hardly any different from those in the countryside, owing to the change in terrorist strategy, which aimed at greater activity in the cities during 1989-1990 and at eliminating popular resistance by means of selective murders and forcible recruitment.
44. Displacement has mainly involved the Andean and indigenous peasant population (approximately 70 per cent of displaced persons), while some 20 per cent has arisen from fringe urban sectors and rural district capitals and 10 per cent middle and high-level strata.
45. In these circumstances, women have played a more leading role, partly by preserving the family, which has been deeply affected in a number of ways, ranging from the disappearance of familiar surroundings and disintegration, to the death of family members and the ceaseless exposure to high~risk situations, and partly by entering the production sector, helping to organize the community for self-defence, etc.
46. The National Technical Commission on Displaced Populations was established in August 1991 for the purpose of undertaking a multi-disciplinary diagnosis of the problem, with the participation of representatives of NG0s, the defence sector, the Catholic Church and other bodies.
On 8 December 1993, the Government established the Assistance Project for Returnees (PAR), within which the National Institute for Development (INADE) is currently comprehensively dealing with all aspects of internal displacement and coordinating international cooperation.
The ultimate objective of the Government's commitment to dealing with the problem of displaced persons is to ensure their return, with proper guarantees for their safety and the satisfaction of their basic needs for self-defence.
The policy of returning displaced families to their places of origin is deliberate and organized collectively through organizations such as the Lima Association of Displaced Families.
47. Although international law contains mechanisms for protecting refugees, who are cross-border migrants, it is for each affected State to solve the problem of internally-displaced persons.
Peru has indicated to the international community that, while the international community is examining the problem from a global standpoint and deciding which legal and political criteria the multilateral organizations will adopt in order to avert the problem, it is essential to begin emergency action in support of national efforts to prevent these internal migratory movements from becoming refugee flows.
48. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 people emigrated from Peru between 1980 and 1990.
49. Because of the years of economic crisis, it is impossible for stabilization programmes and structural reforms to relieve poverty significantly in the short term.
The Government has accordingly reformulated social policy to meet the basic needs of the most vulnerable sectors of the population, without resorting to populist measures that distort market signals and impede economic growth.
50. The standards of living survey carried out in October and November 1991 (ENNIV IV) found that approximately 13 million Peruvians live in poverty.
The problem has been aggravated by economic crisis of recent years.
The gradual spread of poverty is reflected in the 46 per cent decline in consumer spending in metropolitan Lima between 1986 and 1990, followed by a further 39 per cent decline between June 1990 and October 1991, as revealed by the 1991 standards of living survey.
Poverty has spread and diversified as a result of the deterioration of the standards of living of Peru's population.
51. There are many causes of poverty in Peru.
In overall terms, it is reflected in the dramatic drop in GDP, which fell from a maximum index of 109 per cent in 1981 to a minimum of 92.4 per cent in 1992.
52. Even when private investment, national and foreign, generates higher employment levels for the economically active population, it is unrealistic to expect the jobs created to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the population.
As a result, the current deficit in the satisfaction of basic needs will tend to continue for a long time, although it may decrease by comparison with total production or the number of persons in need.
53. The extent of the problem is reflected in the global social deficit, the difference between levels of consumption and the levels required for everyone to have access to a full basic food basket, which amounts to about US$ 15 billion annually.
The urgent social deficit, for the poorer half of the population, amounts to US$ 2.8 billion, while the food deficit of the first three deciles, where extreme poverty is concentrated, amounts to US$ 1.1 billion.
54. The indicators of support action by the State show a lamentable falling-off; State social spending has fallen steadily since 1986, chiefly in the education and health sectors.
The programme of action provides for selective and focused geographic intervention, based on the poverty map, with priority being given to the creation of basic institutional capacities in health services, improvement of the quality of primary education with a view to making it universal, and the administration of justice.
55. Jobs will be created in the rural and marginal urban areas through investment in the social infrastructure and support for production linked to meeting basic needs, especially food supplements for the sectors most at risk.
56. The Inter-Ministerial Commission for Social Affairs (CIAS), subordinate to the President of the Council of Ministers, is responsible for government policy and action for poverty relief and social support.
It will have the support of the Compensation and Social Development Fund (FONCODES) and the Social Development Committees (COMDES), which will be established as ad hoc sectoral technical bodies.
57. The Emergency Social Programme (PES) came into operation in August 1990 as a result of the new Government's stabilization programme, which was designed to provide temporary assistance for Peru's poorest and which continued until March 1991.
The programme was mainly active during its first few months, when it received a large volume of donations in the form of food and medicines, which were directed to families through mothers' clubs, soup kitchens and the Church.
In subsequent months the programme slowed down for lack of funds.
58. In August 1991 the Government promulgated Legislative Decree No. 657, setting up the National Compensation and Social Development Fund (FONCODES), with the aim of financing social investment projects throughout Peru.
Two lines of funding were established: social support and the development of productive employment in the areas of health, food, basic education, infrastructure, etc. for the benefit of the poor.
The target population for FONCODES projects is the group affected by extreme poverty, and within that group, the most vulnerable individuals.
FONCODES divided its lines of action into three sectors:
(a) Social welfare, particularly in the areas of health, nutrition, work and education;
(b) Social infrastructure, construction projects in the areas of sanitation, education, nutrition and health and civil engineering projects in the highways and energy sectors;
(c) overall support for production: financing for productive activities, support for small and microenterprises, reforestation, small-scale fishing, etc.
The fund's resources consist mainly of government allocations, donations, and non-repayable contributions from foreign Governments, foundations and international organizations.
59. There is currently a widespread self-help network operating throughout Peru, based on the various community organizations, which provide a rapid response to family problems.
60. Recent years have shown the collective organizational capacity and determination of the poor.
There has been an increase in mothers' clubs, "Vasos de leche" (glasses of milk), low-income cafeterias and other neighbourhood associations which have provided manpower that is difficult to quantify and served as an invaluable foundation for a number of social-support programmes already under way such as the "Vasos de leche", "The school defends life', and various types of self-managed low-income cafeterias.
61. Active participation by the NG0s, the Church and private business has been an important factor in social development.
62. An objective analysis and understanding of the country's situation require a brief description of the explosion of terrorist violence in Peru from 1980 onwards and the emergence of the terrorist movement "Sendero Luminoso", which makes use of a complex phenomenon of structural violence dating back to the political domination and social contradictions introduced by the conquest.
These have been building up and becoming more acute with time and culminated in the complete abandonment by the State of large areas of the national territory.
63. The return to the constitutional system in 1980 has been marked by a growing economic crisis, a more important role for the grass-roots organizations, an unprecedented volume of drug-trafficking and the overwhelming of obsolete State structures.
Paradoxically, the new democratic regime appeared at the same time as the first terrorist action by "Sendero Luminoso".
64. In 1989, the Senate Committee on Violence and Peacemaking in a report described the various formative stages of the ideological conception of "Sendero Luminoso", from the application of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to the beginning of the so-called armed struggle in 1980, developed along the lines of the "thinking of Gonzalo", according to which the gang's ringleader, Abimael Guzm√°n Reynoso, also known as "Comrade Gonzalo" or "President Gonzalo", claims to have arrived at a theoretical dialectical synthesis of Marxism.
65. "Sendero Luminoso" initially portrayed itself to world public opinion as a group defending the peasants and indigenous communities which were being dominated and exploited by an alleged dictatorial Goverrunent in Peru, an image which is totally false in the light of the crimes against humanity committed.
Its attacks were aimed at military installations and its first victims were political authorities.
66. From 1989 onwards, however, "Sendero Luminoso" considered it had secured a so-called "strategic balance" with the State forces and decided to begin a new stage by aggravating social contradictions.
It denounced the United Nations and the international human rights bodies, and non-governmental organizations engaged in promoting and safeguarding human rights, and began openly to escalate its murders of humble grass-roots leaders, priests of all denominations, foreign voluntary workers, politicians from all parties and anyone who favoured a peaceful solution and opposed violence, as well as ordinary citizens.
The world finally understood the real terrorist nature of "Sendero Luminoso" when, in horror, it saw a family apartment building in a residential area of Lima destroyed by a car bomb and its residents killed.
67. "Sendero Luminoso" has been compared by leading international political analysts with the tragic Pol Pot regime in Cambodia.
Through its official journal El Diario Internacional, which is published in an important European country with the backing of libertarian theories, "Sendero Luminoso" has stated that 2 million Peruvians need to be murdered in order that a new "people's State" may be built; it is in actual fact a terrorist group whose actions, which constitute ordinary crimes under Peru's domestic law and crimes against humanity under international law, may in no way be treated as political crimes.
68. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), is another terrorist group that emerged in 1984 and claims to be the armed representative of the "new left".
Unlike "Sendero Luminoso", it claims to be a guerrilla group, although in practice its "guerrilla" tactics spill over into terrorist actions (hold-ups and abductions) and it is branded by violence.
69. Indiscriminate terrorist violence in Peru has taken a tragic toll of over 27,000 human lives.
70. The objective of the terrorist groups is to cause the greatest possible economic damage in order to paralyse the country's economic activities.
Estimates of damage indicate that Peru has sustained losses of the order of US$ 21 billion, equivalent to the entire foreign debt, in addition to the resources directly assigned to efforts to combat terrorism.
71. Economic reports generally emphasize the direct costs of the destruction of production resources, electricity pylons, roads, bridges, shopping centres, factories, public institutions, banks, etc.
72. An estimate should also be made of the opportunity costs, i.e. the benefits not obtained because of the attacks, the flight of domestic and foreign investment, and the paralysis of tourist services, etc.
73. The introduction of a new anti-terrorism strategy aimed at organizing the people's strong rejection of terrorist methods has already had its first major successes: on 10 September 1993, the main leader of "Sendero Luminoso" was captured, together with 95 per cent of the gang's other leaders, who are now being held in high-security prisons, thanks to anti-terrorist legislation, such as the Ley de Arrepentimiento (Repentance Act).
74. Guzm√°n's arrest has halted the escalation of terrorism.
For the first time, the Government is taking the initiative through a comprehensive anti-terrorism policy.
75. Another result of the Govermnent's anti-terrorism drive has been the arrest of the main leaders of the MRTA.
In addition, collusion between the MRTA and drug-traffickers, bank raids and the "war dues" collected from shopkeepers and businessmen played a role in the dismantling of this terrorist group from within; in recent years it has simply become a gang of criminals.
76. Peru has pressed for the development of legal doctrine to enable international law to cover terrorism as a violation of human rights and to initiate joint action by the international community in order to punish the offence of terrorism and eventually eradicate it altogether.
77. The illiteracy rate in Peru decreased sharply from 57.6 per cent in 1940 to 18.1 per cent in 1981.
During the period 1983-1991, the illiteracy rate among the population aged 15 and over fell from 16.0 to 10.7 per cent.
According to the 1993 census, there are 1,784,281 illiterates in Peru, 15,177 (0.8 per cent) fewer than in 1981.
The decline in the number of illiterates between the two censuses is attributable to the decline in rural illiteracy.
There were 151,036 fewer illiterates in rural areas, whereas the number of urban illiterates rose by 135,859.
II.GENERAL POLITICAL STRUCTURE
A.General legal framework
78. The Peruvian Constitution, which was formulated by the Democratic Constituent Congress elected for that purpose and composed of 80 members, was put to a popular vote and approved by referendum on 31 October 1993.
The President of the Republic promulgated the Constitution on 27 December 1993.
79. Peru is a country that has been moulded by thousands of years of pre-Colombian development and 500 years of Western culture; the Constitution accordingly defines Peru as a multi-ethnic and multicultural country.
80. The Constitution's first provisions relate to the fundamental rights of the individual, its first article stipulating: "The defence of the individual and respect for his dignity constitute the supreme purpose of society and the State."
81. The rights of the individual established in the Constitution are covered by the main provisions of the Constitution of 1979; however, new concepts have been incorporated with a view to strengthening national integration.
82. One of the main innovations of the new Constitution is the incorporation of measures to ensure public participation, through the right of legislative initiative, the right to remove authorities and the right to participate in a referendum, the means by which the electorate approved the present text of the Constitution.
83. One of the fundamental political objectives of this Constitution has been to achieve an appropriate balance of powers, strengthening the effectiveness of the Council of Ministers and Congress itself, together with appropriate municipal decentralization.
B. System of Government
84. In Title II ("The State and the Nation") of the Constitution, article 43 stipulates that "The Republic of Peru is democratic, social, independent and sovereign.
The State is an indivisible whole.
Its Government is unitary, representative and decentralized, and shall be organized in accordance with the principle of the separation of powers."
It is further stipulated that "The power of the State originates from the people.
Those who exercise it do so with the limitations and responsibilities laid down by the Constitution and the laws."
C. The Executive
1. The President and Vice-President of the Republic
85. The President of the Republic is the Head of State and personifies the Nation.
In order to be elected President of the Republic, a person must be Peruvian by birth, be at least 35 years of age at the time of his candidature and enjoy the right to vote.
86. The President of the Republic is elected by direct suffrage, the candidate who obtains more than half the votes being elected.
Spoiled or blank ballot papers are regarded as invalid.
If none of the candidates obtains an absolute majority, a second election is held within 30 days of the proclamation of the official results between the two candidates who obtained the greatest number of votes.
Together with the President of the Republic, two vice-presidents are elected in the same manner, with the same requirements and for the same term.
87. The mandate of the President is for five years; he may be re-elected for an additional period.
Once a minimum period of a further constitutional term has elapsed, a former President may stand for election again subject to the same conditions.
88. The Constitution also establishes the grounds on which the presidency may be relinquished or suspended.
89. The President of the Republic has the following powers, among others:
(a) To execute and enforce the Constitution and treaties, laws and other legal provisions;
(b) To represent the State, within and outside the Republic;
(c) To direct the general policy of the Government;
(d) To watch over the internal order and external security of the Republic;
(e) To convene elections for the office of President of the Republic, elections of members of Congress, and elections for the offices of mayor, alderman and other offices stipulated by law;
(f) To convene Congress as an extraordinary legislature and, in this case, sign the convocation decree;
(g) To address messages to Congress at any time and on an obligatory basis, personally and in writing, when the first annual ordinary legislature begins its sitting;
(h) To establish regulations for laws without transgressing or distorting them, and within those limits, issue decrees and decisions;
(i) To execute and enforce the sentences and decisions of the jurisdictional organs;
(j) To execute and enforce the decisions of the National Election Board;
(k) To direct external international relations policy, and conclude and ratify treaties;
(l) To preside over the national defence system, and organize, distribute and direct the use of the armed forces and the National Police;
(m) To adopt the necessary measures for the defence of the Republic, the integrity of the territory and the sovereignty of the State;
(n) To declare war and sign peace treaties, with the authorization of Congress;
(o) To order extraordinary measures, by means of emergency decrees having force of law, on economic and financial matters, and whenever required by the national interest, with responsibility for reporting to Congress, which may in turn amend the said emergency decrees; and
(p) To exercise such other functions of government and administration as the Constitution and laws may entrust to him.
90. There are currently 13 ministries: Foreign Affairs; the Interior; Justice; Defence; Fisheries; Agriculture; Economy and Finance; Education; Health; Labour and Social Advancement; Energy and Mines; Transport, Communications, Housing and Construction; Industry, Tourism, Integration and Collective International Negotiations.
91. The Council of Ministers is composed of the Ministers of State; it has a President, who is appointed and removed from office by the President of the Republic.
92. The Council of Ministers is responsible for the administration and management of public services, each Minister being responsible for matters falling within his portfolio.
Acts by the President of the Republic lacking ministerial approval are null and void.
93. The President of the Council of Ministers, who may be a minister without portfolio, has the following responsibilities:
(a) To act, after the President of the Republic, as the authorized spokesman for the Government;
(b) To coordinate the functions of the other Ministers;
(c) To approve legislative decrees, emergency decrees and the other decrees and decisions provided for by the Constitution and the law.
94. In order to be a Minister of State, a person must be Peruvian by birth, have citizenship rights and be at least 25 years of age.
Members of the armed forces and the National Police may be Ministers.
95. Among the powers of the Council of Minsters, we would mention the following:
(a) To approve such bills as the President of the Republic may submit to Congress;
(b) To approve such legislative decrees and emergency decrees as may be issued by the President of the Republic, and bills, decrees and decisions as provided for by law;
(c) To discuss matters of public interest; and
(d) Other matters as entrusted to it by the Constitution and the law.
96. Any decision by the Council of Ministers requires the approval of the majority of its members and must be placed on record.
Ministers may exercise no public office other than that of legislator.
97. It is considered that Ministers are individually responsible for their own acts and for the presidential acts they approve.
All Ministers are jointly responsible for any criminal acts or acts in violation of the Constitution or the laws perpetrated by the President of the Republic or agreed on in the Council, even if they withhold their vote, unless they resign immediately.
98. Within 30 days of taking office, the President of the Council must go before Congress, together with the other Ministers, to explain and discuss the general policy of the Government and the principal measures required for the implementation of this policy.
For this purpose he submits a confidence motion.
99. The attendance of the Council of Ministers, or of any of the Ministers, is obligatory when Congress summons them in order to question them; the summons must be in writing and be submitted by not less than 15 per cent of the total number of members of Congress.
100. Congress gives effect to the political responsibility of the Council of Ministers, or of the Ministers separately, through a vote of censure or no confidence.
The latter motion may be submitted only through ministerial initiative.
101. Any censure motion against the Council of Ministers, or against any of the Ministers, must be submitted by not less then 25 per cent of the total number of members of Congress.
To be approved, more than half the total number of members of Congress must vote in favour of the motion.
The Council of Ministers, or the Minister censured, is required to resign.
102. The President of the Council of Ministers may introduce a motion of confidence before Congress on behalf of the Council.
If the confidence motion is rejected, or if the Council is censured, resigns or is dissolved by the President of the Republic, the Cabinet is in complete crisis.
103. To deal with this situation, the Peruvian Constitution has provided for the possibility that the President of the Republic may dissolve Congress if the latter has censured or expressed no confidence in two Councils of Ministers.
Congress may not be dissolved during the final year of its mandate.
105. Once Congress has been dissolved, a Standing Commission continues to act as a temporary supervisory body; this Commission may not be dissolved.
There are no other means of revoking the parliamentary mandate and Congress may not be dissolved under a state of siege.
106. The new Congress may censure the Council of Ministers or deny it a motion of confidence after the President of the Council has reported to Congress on the Executivels acts during the parliamentary'interregnum.
D. The Legislature
107. Legislative authority lies with Congress, which consists of a single chamber and is elected for a five-year term by means of an electoral process organized in accordance with the law.
108. Congress is composed of 120 members, who, in order to be elected, must be Peruvian by birth, be at least 25 years of age and enjoy the right to vote.
109. The members of Congress represent the Nation.
They are not subject to a binding mandate or to a parliamentary question procedure; they are not responsible to any authority or jurisdictional body for the opinions they express and the votes they cast in the exercise of their functions; they may not be tried or arrested without prior authorization by Congress or the Standing Commission, except in flagrante delicto.
110. The legislative mandate is non-renounceable.
Disciplinary penalties imposed by Congress on representatives entailing suspension from office may not exceed 120 days of the term of the legislature.
111. Congress may initiate investigations on any subject of public interest.
When a person has been summoned to appear before a commission responsible for such an investigation, his attendance is compulsory, and subject to the same constraints as those in judicial procedure.
112. The armed forces and the National Police may not enter the premises of Congress without the authorization of the President of Congress.
113. The members of the Congressional Standing Commission are elected by Congress.
Their number tends to be proportionate to the number of representatives of each parliamentary group, and may not exceed 25 per cent of the total number of members of Congress.
114. Among the powers of the Standing Commission, we would note the following:
(a) To designate the Comptroller-General, on the nomination of the President of the Republic;
(b) To ratify the designation of the President of the Central Reserve Bank and of the Superintendent of Banking and Insurance;
(c) To approve supplementary credits, and transfers and credits from the budget during the parliamentary recess;
(d) To exercise such legislative powers as Congress may delegate to it.
Matters relating to constitutional reform or approval of international treaties, organizational laws, the Budget Act and the General Accounts of the Republic Act may not be delegated to the Standing Commission.
115. Among the powers of Congress, we would mention the following:
(a) To enact laws and legislative decrees, and to interpret, amend or repeal existing laws and decrees;
(b) To ensure that the Constitution and the laws are respected, and to order appropriate action in order to give effect to the liability of violators;
(c) To approve treaties, in conformity with the Constitution;
(d) To approve the budget and the general accounts;,
(e) To authorize borrowings, in accordance with the Constitution;
(f) To exercise the right of amnesty;
(g) To approve territorial demarcation as proposed by the Executive;
(h) To give consent to the entry of foreign troops on to the territory of the Republic, provided that national sovereignty is in no way thereby affected;
(i) To authorize the President of the Republic to leave the country.
116. Congress may enact special laws in response to the requirements of a particular situation, but not on account of differences between persons.
117. No law may have retroactive force or effect, except in criminal matters where the law favours the defendant; a law may be repealed only by another law.
The Constitution does not protect abuse of the law.
Matters that are classified as non-delegable may not be delegated to the Standing Commission.
119. No bill may be enacted without having been previously approved by the relevant consultative commission except where provided for in the rules of procedure of Congress.
Draft legislation of an urgent character submitted by the Executive has priority before Congress.
120. The President of the Republic and the members of Congress have the right of initiative in the formulation of laws.
The other branches of State authority, the autonomous public institutions, the municipalities and the professional associations have the same right in matters within their competence.
121. Citizens who exercise the right of initiative in accordance with the law also have this right.
122. The power to administer justice emanates from the people and is exercised by the Judiciary through its hierarchical organs in accordance with the Constitution and the laws.
123. In any proceedings, if there is incompatibility between a constitutional provision and a legal provision, the judges give precedence to the former.
Similarly, they give precedence to the legal provision over any other provision of lower rank.
124. The following are principles and rights of the jurisdictional function:
(a) Unity and exclusiveness of the jurisdictional function.
The military and arbitral jurisdictions are recognized as independent jurisdictions;
(b) Independence in the exercise of the jurisdictional function.
No authority may assume jurisdiction in cases pending before a jurisdictional organ or interfere in the exercise of its functions;
c) The observance of due process and jurisdictional protection.
No person may be diverted from the jurisdiction predetermined by law or subjected to proceedings other than those previously established;
(d) The public nature of proceedings, except where provided for by law.
Judicial proceedings in which the defendants are public officials, those involving press crimes and those which relate to fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution are always public;
(e) Written substantiation of judicial decisions in all instances, except for purely procedural orders;
(f) Plurality of instances;
(g) Compensation, in the form determined by law, for miscarriages of justice in criminal trials and for arbitrary detention, without prejudice to any liability that may be determined;
(h) The principle of not failing to administer justice because of a lacuna or deficiency in the law.
In such a case, the general principles of written law and customary law apply;
(i) The principle of the non-applicability by analogy of the criminal law and of provisions which restrict rights;
(j) The principle of no punishment without a trial;
(k) The application of the law most favourable to the defendant in the event of doubt or conflict between criminal laws;
(l) The principle whereby no defendant may be sentenced in absentia;
(m) The prohibition of the reopening of proceedings closed by means of an enforceable judgement;
(n) The principle whereby no defendant may be deprived of the right of defence at any stage of the proceedings;
(o) The principle that every person must be informed, immediately and in writing, of the causes of or reasons for his arrest;
(p) The principle that the administration of justice is free, and that
(q) Popular participation in the appointment and removal of judges, in accordance with the law;
(r) The obligation of the Executive to extend such cooperation as may be requested of it in proceedings;
(s) Prohibition of the exercise of the judicial function by anyone who has not been appointed in the manner provided for by the Constitution or the law;
(t) The principle that every person has the right to make analyses and criticisms of judicial decisions and sentences, within the limitations of law;
(u) The right of remand and sentenced prisoners to occupy decent premises;
(v) The principle that the purpose of the prison regime is re-education, rehabilitation and reintegration of the prisoner into society.
125. The Constitution also stipulates that the death penalty may be imposed only for the offence of treason in time of war and terrorism, in accordance with the laws and treaties to which Peru is a party.
126. The Judiciary is made up of jurisdictional organs which administer justice in the name of the Nation and by organs by which it is governed and administered.
127. The jurisdictional organs are: the Supreme Court of Justice, and such other courts as may be determined by the Judiciary's organization act.
128. The President of the Supreme Court is also President of the Judiciary.
The plenary Supreme Court is the highest deliberating body of the Judiciary.
129. The State guarantees to judges:
(a) Their independence; they are subject only to the Constitution and the law;
(b) Irremovability from their posts; they may not be transferred without their consent;
(c) Permanency of tenure, provided their conduct and ability are commensurate with their office;
(d) Remuneration which assures them a standard of living appropriate to their responsibility and seniority.
130. In order to be a judge of the Supreme Court of Justice, a person must:
(a) Be Peruvian by birth;
(b) Have citizenship rights;
(c) Be at least 45 years of age;
(d) Have been a Higher Court judge or senior government procurator for 10 years or have practised as a lawyer or held a university chair in a legal discipline for 15 years.
131. Lastly, it should be borne in mind that the Constitution has granted the power to exercise the judicial function, for the purposes of the execution of their customary law, to the rural and native communities with the support of the rural patrols.
The law will establish the forms of coordination of this special jurisdiction with the magistrates' court and the other instances of judicial authority.
F. The National Council of the Judiciary
132. The National Council of the Judiciary is an independent and autonomous organ which is responsible for the selection and appointment of judges and procurators, except when the latter are elected by the people.
133. Justices of the peace are appointed on the basis of a popular election, organized in accordance with the law.
134. The National Council of the Judiciary has the following functions:
(a) Appointment, on the basis of a public competitive examination and personal evaluation and with the approval of two thirds of its members, of judges and procurators at all levels;
(b) Confirmation of the appointment of judges and procurators at all levels every seven years;
(c) Enforcement of the penalty of dismissal in the case of members of the Supreme Court and Senior Government Procurators and, at the request of the Supreme Court or the Board of Senior Government Procurators, judges and procurators at all instances;
(d) Awarding to judges and procurators the official title accrediting their status.
135. The Peruvian Constitution establishes the composition of the National Council of the Judiciary and the requirements for membership.
G. The Public Prosecutor's Department
136. The Public Prosecutor's Department is autonomous and presided over by the Attorney-General of the Nation, who is elected by the Board of Senior Government Procurators.
137. The term of office of the Attorney-General of the Nation is three years, which may be extended by re-election for a further two years.
The members of the Public Prosecutor's Department have the same rights and prerogatives and are subject to the same obligations as those of the Judiciary in the relevant category.
138. The Public Prosecutor's Department has the following functions:
(a) Promoting, ex officio or on application, judicial action in in furtherance of legality and of the public interests safeguarded by law;
(b) Ensuring the independence of the jurisdictional organs and the proper administration of justice;
(c) Representing society in judicial proceedings;
(d) Conducting the investigation of an offence from its outset.
To this end, the National Police are obliged to fulfil the mandates of the Public Prosecutor's Department within the context of their function;
(e) Instituting criminal proceedings ex officio or on application;
(f) Expressing an opinion prior to judicial decisions in the cases provided for by law;
(g) Taking the initiative in the formulation of laws, and reporting to Congress or the President of the Republic on lacunae or deficiencies in legislation.
H. The Ombudsman
139. One of the principal innovations of the new Peruvian Constitution is the institution of the Ombudsman, which is separate from the Public Prosecutor's Department.
140. The Ombudsman is autonomous, and public bodies are obliged to collaborate with him whenever he so requests.
141. The Ombudsman is elected and removed by Congress; in order to be elected Ombudsman a person must be at least 35 years of age and be a lawyer.
The office carries a five-year term and is not subject to a binding mandate.
142. It is the responsibility of the Ombudsman to safeguard the constitutional and fundamental rights of the individual and the community, and to supervise fulfilment of the duties of the State administration and the performance of public services.
143. The Ombudsman submits a report to Congress once a year or whenever the latter so requests.
He may take the initiative in the formulation of laws and may propose measures to facilitate the more effective performance of his functions.
IV. The National Electoral Board
144. In conformity with Peru's Constitution, the purpose of the electoral system is to ensure that elections allow citizens to express themselves authentically, freely and spontaneously and that ballots are an accurate and timely reflection of the will of the electorate as expressed in the ballot box by direct vote.
145. The Board's basic functions are to plan, organize and hold elections, referendums or other popular votes; to maintain and keep a single register of personal identities and to register all acts affecting civil status.
146. The electoral system comprises the National Electoral Board, the National Electoral Procedures Office and the National Identity and Civil Status Registry.
147. The National Electoral Board is responsible, inter alia, for:
(a) Ensuring the lawfulness of ballots and electoral procedures, referendums and other popular votes;
(b) Maintaining and keeping the register of political organizations;
(c) Ensuring compliance with the rules relating to political organizations;
(d) Proclaiming candidates elected.
148. The highest authority of the National Electoral Board is the plenary, composed of five members as follows:
(a) One member elected by secret ballot by the Supreme Court from among its judges, either retired or serving.
If in office, the judge is granted leave of absence and it is he who presides over the Board.
(b) One member elected by secret ballot by the Board of Senior Government Procurators from among retired or serving senior procurators; in this case too, the elected judge is granted leave of absence;
(c) One member elected by secret ballot by the Lima Bar Council from among its members;
(d) One member elected by secret ballot by the Deans of the Law Faculties of public universities from among former deans;
(e) One member elected by secret ballot by the Deans of the Law Faculties of private universities from among former deans.
149. The 1993 Constitution lays down certain eligibility requirements for representatives of the National Electoral Board: for example, they may not be younger than 45 or older than 60; they are elected for a four-year period, and may be re-elected, albeit alternately, after two years.
The position is full-time and paid.
150. As far as conditions of ineligibility for the National Electoral Board are concerned, the 1979 Constitution used to disqualify any persons exercising positions of responsibility in political organizations, or who had held such positions in the six years preceding their candidacy.
This has now changed, and the period has been reduced to four years.
151. At present, the head of the National Electoral Procedures Office is appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary for a renewable four-year period; he may be dismissed for serious negligence and is subject to the ineligibility conditions attached to membership of the National Electoral Board.
The head of the National Identity and Civil Status Register is also appointed by the National Council of the Judiciary for a renewable four-year period, and is responsible for registering births, marriages, divorces and deaths.
152. The National Electoral Board may nullify the whole electoral procedure if the number of void and blank votes is more than two thirds of the total number of votes cast, unlike under the 1979 Constitution, when the proportion was one third of the valid votes cast nationally.
153. Votes are counted publicly in the presence of the representatives of the political parties in order to ensure transparency.
Peruvians who live abroad may vote at Peruvian consulates.
154. Since 1980, the population has been called to vote four times; three times for elections and once for a referendum in which the Constitution was approved.
155. The 1979-1980 elections were governed by Decree-Law No. 14250; they led to the election, for a five-year period, of the President of the Republic, senators and deputies who remained in office from 1980 to 1985.
Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry was elected President and a total of 60 senators and 180 deputies were elected for the whole country.
156. Alan Garc√≠a Perez was elected President for the 1985-1990 period, along with 60 senators, and 180 deputies.
157. Alberto Fujimori Fujimori was elected President for the 1990-1995 period.
On 5 April 1992 he dissolved Congress and called for elections, under Decree-Law No. 25684, of the Democratic Constituent Congress with 80 representatives.
158. The referendum of 31 October 1993 approved Peru's Constitution.
V. TREATIES IN PERU
159. Under Peru's 1993 Constitution, treaties entered into by Peru are part of national law.
As to the legal hierarchy of treaties, Peru's Political Constitution, together with international human rights treaties, take precedence, followed by international treaties on Latin American integration, multilateral treaties and other international instruments.
160. In order for treaties to be legally binding, they must be ratified by the President of the Republic.
However, treaties relating to certain matters must be approved by Congress prior to being ratified by the President.
161. The matters requiring prior approval by Congress are the following:
(a) Human rights;
(b) The sovereignty, authority or integrity of the State;
(c) National defence;
(d) The State's financial commitments.
(e) In addition, the Constitution stipulates that all treaties which either introduce, amend or cancel taxes, which require laws to be amended or abrogated or which require legislative measures in order for them to come into force must be approved by Congress before they are ratified by the President of the Republic.
162. Treaties in areas other than those referred to above may, however, be entered into or ratified by the President of the Republic without the need for prior approval from Congress, although the President must keep Congress informed.
163. In addition, if the treaty has a bearing on provisions of the Constitution, it must be approved by the same procedure as for constitutional reform, before it may be ratified by the President.
This procedure is governed by article 206 of the Constitution.
164. Authority to denounce treaties is vested in the President of the Republic, who is required to report thereon to Congress.
In order to denounce treaties that require congressional approval, prior approval from Congress is also required.
165. As regards the procedure for the adoption of treaties, when Peru has negotiated a treaty with other States or international organizations through its representatives and has signed the treaty, it must express its consent to be bound by the treaty and to fulfil its obligations.
This consent is given by ratification.
166. Once treaties have been approved by Congress, where the law requires, they must be ratified by the President of the Republic.
This is because it is not sufficient for a treaty to be signed by representatives who have negotiated it, as their signature is not binding upon the State.
167. Peru's representatives must possess the proper credentials.
However, the State is under no obligation to ratify a treaty, nor is there a specific deadline within which a treaty must be ratified.
VI. BODIES PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS
169. Until the 1979 Constitution came into effect, the Public Prosecutor's Department was considered to be an integral part of the Judiciary. Then in 1979 the Government of Peru, as the foundation of the country's human rights system, gave the Public Prosecutor's Department responsibility for protecting human rights.
Under the present system, responsibility for protecting constitutional and fundamental rights lies with the Office of the Ombudsman, a new institution which was established under Peru's 1993 Constitution.
170. In this regard, Legislative Decree No. 052 (Public Prosecutor's Department Organization Act), promulgated on 16 March 1981, stipulates in its article 1 that "the Public Prosecutor's Department is an autonomous State agency whose principal function is to defend legality, the rights of citizens and the public interest ... ".
171. Subsequently the Office of the Attorney-General instituted the Offices of Ombudsman and Procurator for Human Rights for the Whole Nation, charged with assuming jurisdiction over and investigating complaints of human rights violations, protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of individuals and of the community, as well as ensuring that the State administration performs its duties and that public services are made available to citizens.
172. In order to implement the National Pacification Plan and to provide guidance and support for all the efforts made to bring about peace in Peru and to ensure full respect for human rights, the Peace Council was instituted under Legislative Decree No. 652; the Council is composed of the representatives of different national sectors and sits in the capital and in each of the country's regions.
173. Subsequently, under Decree-Law No. 25993, the Organization Act relating to the Judiciary was approved, stipulating that the National Council for Human Rights shall be the agency responsible for promoting, coordinating and advising on protection for and the observance of fundamental individual rights.
This Council is governed by Supreme Decree No. 038-93-JUS, of 7 October 1993, its main aim being to help develop a sound awareness of the need to respect fundamental individual rights.
The establishment of the Council fulfils some of the principles laid down by the main international human rights instruments, in so far as it allows the formulation of policies, mechanisms and measures for the full protection of human rights, among public and non-governmental human rights bodies.
174. In addition, in its effort to strengthen Peru's system of legal protection for human rights, the Government has adopted further domestic legislation.
The Ministry of the Interior has set up human rights offices as integral parts of the Prefectures, Sub-Prefectures, Governorships and Sub-Governorships.
In addition, it has established the National Human Rights Committee as a coordination and monitoring body within the Ministry of the Interior.
175. This shows that domestic human rights legislation has been strengthening and consolidating the protection of human rights.
Now, bodies that lacked human rights committees organize programmes on human rights defence policies and machinery as a means of improving social harmony.
176. Subsequently, on 26 June 1992, with Decree-Law No. 25992, the Government introduced penalties for officials or civil servants responsible for disappearances together with regulations governing the Register of Complaints relating to Disappeared Persons, as a means of securing the right to personal liberty, a fundamental individual right which every democratic Government should protect.
Within this framework, under decision No. 342-92-MP/FN of the Attorney-General's Office, dated 10 June 1992, the Register of Complaints relating to Disappeared Persons was set up under the responsibility of the Offices of the Special Procurator for Human Rights and the Ombudsman.
177. As a result of the adoption of Peru's 1993 Constitution, responsibility for defending the constitutional and fundamental rights of the individual and of the community, amongst others, was vested in the Office of the Ombudsman under the terms of chapter nine, section four, where it is specified that the Ombudsman is appointed and dismissed by Congress and that he is responsible for defending the constitutional and fundamental rights of the individual and of the community.
178. As a transitional measure, all government procurator's offices have been given responsibility for dealing with complaints relating to human rights violations.
Complaints relating to disappeared persons are dealt with by the Registry of Disappeared Persons.
179. Act No. 26295 established the National Register of Detainees and Persons Sentenced to Custodial Sentences, the purpose of which is to secure the human rights of detainees and of persons sentenced to imprisonment.
180. In 1991 the Technical Commission for Displaced People was set up to deal with families displaced from their places of origin by terrorist violence.
On 9 October 1993, the Programme of Support for the Population (PAR) was established in order to assist the return of displaced people to their places of origin.
On 10 April 1994 the Interministerial PAR Committee was set up, in order to coordinate and implement action by the Ministries of Health, Education, Transport, Agriculture, Defence, Industry and the Office of the President.
181. On 5 February 1993, the internal rules of the Democratic Constituent Congress were adopted, establishing among its commissions the Pacification and Human Rights Commission, whose role is to secure the fundamental and constitutional rights of individuals.
182. Despite all the existing human rights legislation, non-governmental organizations are allowed to operate in this area without any form of restriction.
REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN
ARTICLE 1
Peruvian women today: basic statistics
1. Peru's female population consists of 11,091,981 women, or 50.3 per cent of the total population, which was 22,048,356 according to the 1993 census.
The number of women residing in urban areas is 7,852,110, or 70 per cent of the total.
2. As a result of centralization and patterns of migration and urbanization, 41 per cent of the urban female population (3,243,782), and 29 per cent of the total female population is concentrated in the Lima-Callao metropolitan area.
3. A breakdown by age group reveals that 36 of every 100 women are girls under 15 years of age, 21 are young women aged 15 to 24, 38 are adults and 5 are over 65 years of age, which shows that 57 per cent of the female population consists of very young people.
Implementation of the principle of non-discrimination against women.
4. Discrimination is the relegation of women to set traditional roles predetermined by cultural prejudices which largely prevent them from fully developing their potential and participating actively in society beyond their role of mother and homemaker.
The gap between women's achievements and participation and those of men is the result of functions imposed by society on the two sexes and not of biological differences.
The need for women and men to work together to achieve equality, peace and development has therefore given rise to expectations.
In the 1990s, this attitude has resulted in the gradual incorporation of men in activities for the advancement of women and of groups of women in negotiations and discussions involving both sexes, thus creating broader social bases for women to emerge from their marginalized position.
5. The position of Peruvian women at the start of this decade was an improvement over their past situation, in terms both of their involvement in public affairs and their access to services.
The improved visibility of women in the social, economic and political life of the nation is creating the foundations for a new image for women and recognition of their role in social affairs, including the struggle against poverty and for development and peace.
6. Women as a group are better educated; girls are able to attend school nearly on an equal footing with boys.
Around 50 per cent of primary school students are girls, and young women constitute 40 per cent of students at university.
7. As regards health, women have a better understanding of and involvement in issues relating to their reproductive health.
8. In respect of employment, women have good prospects and improved opportunities for entering the job market, and the right to vote has been given to illiterates.
9. The emergence and consolidation of feminist organizations and women's rights groups has made a significant impact.
10. The administrative and managerial experience and negotiating skills acquired by women in grass-roots organizations has created a new type of leadership.
11. The fact that family violence, which affects primarily girls, boys and women, has been brought into the open, and the promulgation in December 1993 of the Domestic Violence Act, have been positive achievements.
12. The establishment in October 1993 of the Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights filled a three-year gap that began with the dissolution of the Ad Hoc Commission on Women's Rights.
13. Nevertheless, Peru has faced enormous difficulties that have affected women in particular, including chronic poverty and a deterioration in the quality of life.
Adverse social, economic and political phenomena have touched everyone, men and women alike, and the schooling of young girls and boys has been restricted.
Women were forced to cope with domestic tasks under more difficult conditions and took new steps to augment the family income; as they entered the economy during a period of recession and prolonged their working hours, their overall health suffered.
In addition, the influx of adult women into the job market caused responsibilities to be transferred to young girls and adolescents who have become "little mothers", with the absence and/or limited participation of male adults in household tasks and family responsibilities.
14. The terrorist violence that has displaced thousands of women, boys and girls is an extreme manifestation of the events of this period.
It is estimated that at least 120,000 families (approximately 600,000 individuals) have been displaced over the past 12 years.
Thousands of women have become heads of households (78 per cent of heads of displaced families are women) because their spouses have died or abandoned the family.
Women's responsibilities and workloads have magnified; they have been subjected to racism, been brutally uprooted from their homes and have lost their homes and possessions.
Fifty-four per cent of the women was displaced within the departments where they originally resided, while 46 per cent was displaced towards other areas.
15. It is likewise important to consider gaps and inequities in the quality of life of the various population groups on the basis of geographical location or place of residence.
Metropolitan Lima offers advantages over the rest of the country, and urban settlements are preferable to rural ones.
The limited knowledge of the community and women themselves about national and international legislation on women's rights must be taken into account, as must the adverse impact of cultural prejudices which confine women to traditional roles in the private sphere (domestic tasks and care of the family).
Finally, the lack of research on the situation of women in various social and eonomic spheres and the scarcity of gender-disaggregated information are likewise a cause of concern.
16. In terms of legislation, article 2, paragraph 2, of the Peruvian Constitition states that "Every person shall have the right to equality before the law.
No one shall be subjected to discrimination on grounds of origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion or economic status or on any other grounds".
17. In addition, article 4 of the Civil Code provides that "Men and women shall have equal opportunities for the enjoyment and exercise of civil rights".
18. Finally, there are gaps among women themselves linked to their geographical location, socio-economic level and political participation, as well as their cultural and racial origins.
These differences have created groups that are marginalized and disregarded.
ARTICLE 2
LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION
19. The vestiges of discrimination against women in legal matters have for the most part been erased.
Action to improve the suitability, application and dissemination of the legislation has been initiated.
Constitutional legislation
20. The Peruvian Constitution, which entered into force on 31 December 1993, proclaims the right of all persons to equality before the law.
It indicates that no one shall be subjected to discrimination on grounds of origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion or economic status or on any other grounds (article 2, paragraph 2).
21. Article 4 of the Constitution provides that the community and the State shall give special protection to abandoned children, adolescents, mothers and elderly persons.
22. Article 23 states that employment, in all its aspects, shall be given priority attention by the State, which shall provide special protection for working mothers, minors and disabled persons.
23. Among the principles governing labour relations, article 26 mentions equality of opportunity without discrimination.
24. Finally, it should be noted that in 1955, women aged 21 and over and married women above the age of 18 who were able to read and write were given the right to vote.
The 1979 Constitution extended the right to vote to all women over age 18, literate or illiterate, and this rule remains in force in the present Constitution.
Civil legislation
25. One of the first provisions of the current Civil Code states that "Men and women shall have equal opportunities for the enjoyment and exercise of civil rights" (article 4).
26. It is also noteworthy that the Civil Code of 1984 introduced an important change connected with the equality of men and women in arbitral matters.
Article 551, para. 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure stated that only men could be appointed as arbiters.
In conformity with article 2, para. 2, of the 1979 Constitution, article 1916 of the 1984 Civil Code did away with this unjust impediment to the service of women as arbiters; it was itself overriden by the entry into force of Act No. 25935, General Arbitration Act, article 20 of which reaffirms the removal of the above-mentioned restriction.
27. Individual relations among spouses, parental authority and guardianship will be covered in the context of article 16 of the Convention.
Legislation on Civil Procedure
28. The Code of Civil Procedure promulgated on 27 July 1993 abrogated Act No. 1510 of 1911, which had regulated the Code of Civil Proceedings formerly in force.
A number of regulations that discriminated against women's appearance in court proceedings were thereby overturned.
29. The current Code of Civil Procedure provides that when the conjugal union appears as the plaintiff, it shall be represented by either of the spouses.
On the other hand, when the conjugal union is the defendant, representation is incumbent upon both spouses (article 65).
The new Code is a step forward because previously, a women needed the authorization of her husband or, failing that, judicial authorization, to appear in court proceedings.
Commercial Legislation
30. With the entry into force in July 1993 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a series of provisions restricting the commercial activity of married women were annulled.
These discriminatory regulations in a Code of Commerce in force since 1902 indicated that a married women was dependent on her spouse in order to engage in commercial activity.
31. It is important to highlight the fact that the above-mentioned articles were explicitly declared null and void; although they had to be considered tacitly annulled with the entry into force of the 1979 Constitution establishing equality between men and women, the texts of these articles continued to be reproduced as if they were still in force, which was definitely not the case.
32. A clear expression of equality between the sexes was thus reaffirmed in commercial legislation by the explicit statement that the regulations that discriminated on grounds of gender were abolished.
Prison Legislation
33. The Penal Code promulgated in April 1991 repealed the earlier Code in force since 1924.
The new Code had a new approach emphasizing the social reinsertion function of prison and replacing rigourous penalties by community service.
It benefits women serving time in the country's prisons.
34. The provisions of the Penal Code dealing with women include one indicating that anyone who knowingly murders a progenitor or descendent, whether natural or adoptive, or a spouse or companion, is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of 15 years (art. 107 PC).
35. A mother who kills her child during childbirth or in the prepartum period is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of one year and a maximum of four or to community service for a period ranging from 52 to 104 days (art. 110 PC).
36. A woman who aborts a foetus or is aware that another person is doing so is subjected to a custodial sentence of a maximum of two years or to community service for a period ranging from 52 to 104 days.
37. A person who practices an abortion with the consent of a pregant woman is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of one and a maximum of four years.
If the woman dies and the agent of abortion could have prevented her death, the penalty is a minimum of two and a maximum of five years (art. 115 PC).
It is important to note that consent must be given by a woman who is free and in full possession of her capacities, and that such consent does not exonerate the abortioner.
38. A person who forces a woman to abort without her consent is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of three and a maximum of five years.
If the woman dies and the agent of abortion could have prevented her death, the penalty is a minimum of five and a maximum of ten years (art. 116 PC).
39. Abortion performed by a physician with the consent of the pregnant woman or of her legal representative, where applicable, is not punishable when it is the sole method of saving the pregant woman's life or of preventing grave or permanent damage to her health (therapeutic abortion) (art. 119 PC).
40. A woman who feigns pregancy or childbirth in order to confer dubious rights on a fictitious child is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of one year and a maximum of five (art. 144 PC).
41. A person who impregates a pregnant woman and abandons her in a critical situation is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of six months and a maximum of four years, as well as to 60 to 90 fine-days (art. 150 PC).
Assistance must be given to a woman who has been impregnated and abandoned in a critical situation jeopardizing her safety as well as that of the unborn child.
42. Article 208, para. 1, of the Penal Code: "Without prejudice to any civil compensation that may be provided, no penalty shall be imposed for theft, appropriation, fraud or damage committed among themselves by: 1) spouses and companions; and progenitors, descendents and other persons directly related to one another".
43. Prostitution and trafficking in women will be discussed in connection with article 6 of the Convention.
Administrative legislation
44. The Administrative Procedures - General Regulations Act adopted in 1994 replaced an earlier regulation that had been in force since 1967.
Both the present Act and its predecessor make no reference whatsoever to the sex of citizens or individuals involved in administrative proceedings.
There are around 80,000 provisions in all, so it is difficult to carry out an exhaustive analysis of administrative legislation.
45. The existence of Supreme Resolution No. 183-94-PCM, which approved the Budgetary Programme to Direct Basic Social Spending - Organizational Regulation, should be noted.
46. The purpose of this programme is to promote equality of opportunity for all the country's citizens, giving priority to selective action to benefit the needist sectors by improving the quality of coverage and the efficiency of basic social spending.
It envisages basic social spending as expenditure for the provision of basic preventive health services, primary and secondary education and basic and supplementary legal services.
47. The programme's implementation is of special importance in so far as it will improve the status and protection of women by coordinating the treatment currently given to women not only in the legislative and political arenas but also in the implementation and effective development of programmes to benefit women.
Legislation on domestic violence
48. Act No. 26260, adopted in December 1993, approved the State and national policy regulations on domestic violence.
This is arguably one of the most important provisions ever adopted to deal directly with the situation of women and their treatment under the law.
49. With a view to eradicating domestic violence, it mentions the possibility of carrying out a variety of activities, including the following: strengthening ethical values and respect for the dignity of the person and for the rights of women in schools and extracurricular education; implementing campaigns to disseminate information about women's rights; creating effective legal mechanisms for victims of domestic violence; establishing so-called "Police Commissioner's Offices for Women", likewise known as women's police offices, in the geographical areas where they are most needed; promoting the creation of shelters for victims of violence, etc.
50. The Act provides that the police, the Public Prosecutor and the judiciary are the bodies with competence to intervene concerning acts of domestic violence.
51. Through the police offices for women and minors, the police receive complaints and carry out preliminary investigations. To facilitate the submission of complaints to the police, forms have been issued enabling victims to make complaints without unnecessary complications or red tape.
52. Through the provincial civil prosecutor, the Public Prosecutor's Department must constantly strive to achieve the reconciliation of the couple and any other family members involved in a conflict.
Representatives of the Public Prosecutor perform a supervisory function by regularly visiting police stations to investigate complaints concerning violence against women.
53. Finally, this Act regulates the processing by the judiciary of civil or criminal court cases to which acts of violence against women have given rise.
The Code of Children and Adolescents
54. This legislation, approved by Decree-Law No. 26102 of 24 December 1992, has been a major step forward in the protection of minors and of women as the mothers of minors and adolescents.
55. Throughout the legislation there are provisions that indicate that the woman is not without legal protection.
56. Among the provisions in the Code of Children and Adolescents that specifically identify women is Title I, article IV: "The present Code shall apply to all children and adolescents residing in the territory of Peru with no distinction whatsoever on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, nationality, social origin, economic status, ethnic group, physical or mental disability or any other condition applying to the child or adolescent or to his or her parents or guardians".
57. Title I, article V. "Under the present Code, the obligation to care for the child or adolescent is deemed to fall upon the mother and family of such child or adolescent".
This provision is the cornerstone of protection of women.
Under it, any assistance provided to a minor extends to the mother and to the minor's family.
58. Article 2. CARE OF THE MOTHER. "The State shall have the responsibility to guarantee, and society, to promote, the creation of appropriate conditions for the care of the mother during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period, giving special attention to adolescent mothers and breastfeeding and the establishment of day care centres".
This article indicates that care shall be provided for the mother before, during and after childbirth.
59. Article 6. ON THE NAME, IDENTITY AND NATIONALITY OF THE CHILD. "A child or adolescent shall have the right to a name, to Peruvian nationality and to know and be cared for by his or her parents.
He or she shall be entered in the appropriate civil register by his or her mother or guardian immediately after birth.
The district municipality responsible for the register shall effect the birth registry free of charge during an initial period of 24 hours.
Should the registry not take place within 30 days, administrative inscription may be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Book Two, Chapter VI, of the present Code.
The State shall guarantee this right through the creation of a single register of personal identities.
In respect of the right to a name, the relevant provisions of the Civil Code shall apply".
60. Article 7. IDENTIFICATION. "The birth certificate shall include the fingerprints of the mother and the footprints of the newborn, as well as other information appropriate to the nature of the document".
This provision establishes the procedure for identification of the newborn.
The birth certificate must include both the fingerprints of the mother and the footprints of the child, as well as other information appropriate to the document.
61. Article 31, para. 3. ON HEALTH. "The State, with the cooperation and assistance of civil society, shall develop the necessary programmes to reduce mortality and prevent illness, educate the family on hygiene and sanitation and combat malnutrition, with priority to be given in these programmes to children and adolescents living in especially difficult circumstances and to pregnant and nursing adolescent mothers".
62. Article 81, para.1. PETITIONARIES. "In the event of the maternal and paternal orphanage of a child, lack of other relatives or abandonment by or ignorance of the child's progenitors, the birth registration may be requested by directors of protection centres, the children's ombudsman, directors of educational centres, the special children's judge or a representative of the Public Prosecuter, in conformity with the requirements set out in the articles above".
"Parental rights shall be suspended in the following circumstances: (...) (c) Absence, established in accordance with the law, of the father or mother". 64. Article 91.
PETITIONING. "A father or mother whose spouse or companion has forcibly removed his or her child or who seeks the recognition of his or her custodial or guardianship rights shall submit a petition to that effect, accompanied by an identification document, the birth certificate and relevant evidence".
Custodianship of children and adolescents may be exercised by any person having a legitimate interest.
65. Article 98. VISITING RIGHTS. "A father or mother whose right to visit his or her child has been restricted or limited shall submit the appropriate petition, accompanied by a birth certificate attesting to his or her direct kinship".
66. It is also important to highlight the topic of violence against women, in all its forms.
67. A new type of violence against women has flared up over the past decade: terrorist violence, manifested in murder, torture, rape and displacement.
The main arena of the violence has been the southern Sierra and central parts of the country; in the jungle, it has been compounded by the impact of drug trafficking and seriously affects not only peasants but also the indigenous population.
68. Domestic and sexual violence are the most serious manifestations of violence against women.
A law was adopted to combat domestic violence in 1993.
The first women's police office was established in 1989 and others have been set up in 7 departments at the initiative of the women's movement.
Nevertheless, threats to and harm suffered by women remain a fact of daily life and call for appropriate application of regulations.
69. The number of women affected by domestic violence is difficult to determine, owing to lack of reporting, under-reporting and inadequacy of official records.
70. In 1993, the women's police office in Lima recorded 4,500 complaints of physical abuse of women by their spouses.
In other cities, there have been half as many complaints or less, a function partly of their smaller populations but also of greater difficulty of access to institutions where complaints may be lodged.
Available statistics reflect only a portion of the cases of domestic violence: as is pointed out in the report of the special Senate Committee on Violence and Peacemaking (1988), only one fifth of the women subjected to violence submit complaints about it.
71. From August 1988, when the Lima women's police office began operating, to 1993, 21,425 complaints of physical abuse were recorded.
An average of four thousand complaints have been received every year since 1989.
72. The majority of the complaints submitted to the police relate to acts of violence committed in the home by spouses or companions, ex-spouses or ex-companions, or individuals who have engendered children but have not lived with the woman.
In 54 per cent of all the complaints submitted from 1991 to 1992, the aggressor was the victim's spouse and in 40 per cent, the companion.
73. Eighty-three per cent of the complainants are aged 20 to 39 and 69 per cent are from lower income groups.
Although violence affects women from all social strata and employment situations, those who have no independent income are at greater risk of mistreatment.
According to statistics on Lima and a major city in the interior of the country (Arequipa), around 60 per cent of complainants are housewives, while 20 or 25 per cent are mid-level officials or professional workers.
74. Concerning the causes of violence, 68 per cent of the complaints recorded by the police commissioner's office for women in Lima gave the cause of the mistreatment as family problems and lack of understanding, followed by 15 per cent, jealously and infidelity, and 13 per cent, economic problems.
75. The majority of the aggressors had not consumed alcohol or drugs at the time of their actions.
Women subjected to violence suffered various forms of psycho-social damage: among young people, it restricts the possibilities for future development, has an impact on creative capacity and reduces opportunities.
76. An important step forward from the legal standpoint is the recent adoption, in 1993, of Domestic Violence Act No. 26260.
This Act has no precedent whatsoever in Peruvian legislation. It was propelled forward and negotiated by women parliamentarians and feminist institutions that worked together from the late 1980s to develop draft legislation against domestic violence.
77. The central objective is the eradication of domestic violence, both physical and psychological, through a number of initiatives: educational and consciousness-raising campaigns; introduction of effective legal mechanisms for victims and treatment for aggressors; establishment and reinforcement of police commissioner's offices for women (Comisar√≠as de Mujeres); institution at municipal level of temporary shelters; training of members of the police force, prosecutors and judges and investigation of the causes of domestic violence.
78. To give effect to this legislation, criteria must be established for evaluation of the psychological damage suffered by victims and allocation of appropriate State and municipal funding.
These issues remain pending.
79. The Government's concern has centred mainly on the establishment of police commissioner's offices for women staffed by women police officers to receive complaints by women of abuse, sexual violence and domestic violence in general.
80. The first women's police office started its activities in August 1988 in Lima.
Subsequently, from 1992 to 1994, similar bodies were established in 11 provinces throughout the country.
Unlike other police departments, the women's police offices are backed up by legal, psychological and social services and strong support is given by feminist non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
81. In June 1994, women accounted for 9.5 per cent of the operational staff of the national police.
Women were first recruited in the late 1970s, with such recruitment increasing after 1978 and the establishment of the school for women police officers within the Civil Guard.
82. The role of women police officers in the women's police offices has been restricted by the small number of members and insufficient assignment of members to the delegations.
The school for women police officers was closed from 1988 to 1992.
In 1992, there were 46 women police officers in the Lima women's police office, but in 1993, their number was reduced to 30.
83. Despite their potential, it is estimated that the women's police offices have been an option in only about 20 per cent of cases of domestic violence.
From 1989 to 1993, the number of women who submitted complaints to the Lima women's police office remained virtually unchanged at around 4 thousand a year.
84. A large number of women do not submit complaints for lack of proximity or because of the cost of the procedures (expenditure for the report of the criminal pathologist).
Others stop the proceedings because they feel the solutions offered by the legislation and the authorities do not meet their needs (refuge, occupation, family responsibility) or their expectations for solutions.
85. The legal relationship with the spouse appears to affect the woman's decision on whether to complain of abuse.
Married women submit complaints more frequently, this being true both in Lima and the provinces.
86. In 1985, with support from the municipality of Lima, a municipal home for women was established for the purpose of assisting women victims of violence.
It is still in operation, though there are major limitations on its infrastructure and resources.
87. Since 1991-1992 offices for counselling and consultation on women's problems have been available in some municipal districts of Lima such as San Borja, Lur√≠n and Vitarte.
88. Three feminist institutions (Manuela Ramos, Flora Trist√°n and DEMUS) have legal services that provide specialized assistance on cases of domestic violence.
Two of these services were established in 1979, and the third, in 1988.
These institutions have offices for legal aid to women on the premises of the Lima women's police office.
There are other NGOs with similar objectives in the provinces (ILDER in Arequipa, Women's Group in Chiclayo, etc.)
89. In addition, two NGOs in Lima have undertaken the training of women in such grass-roots activities as guidance counselling (Manuela Ramos) and legal promotion (Peru-Women Association) in order to meet the requirements for information and direct support outlined by women.
90. There are currently two shelters for women operating in Lima, the "Home for Supporters of the Catholic Church" and the "Woman's Voice" shelter; the second was established in 1984 and has provided refuge to 2,600 women over the past ten years.
Both institutions have a relatively small admittance capacity: they can take in only eight people at a time.
91. Initiatives are under way to set up shelters in four provincial cities (Ica, Arequipa, Tarapoto and Cuzco).
The Catholic Church also provides refuge to young women in Lima and Trujillo.
92. The recent Domestic Violence Act gives municipalities the responsibility for the establishment of temporary shelters for mistreated women.
Sexual Violence
93. From 1981 to 1991, the police recorded 55,600 complaints of sexual violence, meaning rape, seduction and indecent acts (CUANTO, 1992).
These complaints are estimated to represent only 10 to 30 per cent of the sexual violence actually committed.
94. Although sexual violence is committed against both women and men, offical and unofficial reports show a higher incidence of such offences against adult women, boys and girls.
95. The most serious manifestation of sexual violence is rape. It is difficult to determine the number of women affected.
The feminist organization Manuela Ramos, which deals with cases of sexual violence, estimates the number of rapes of women to be close to 25,000 a year.
96. Two groups of women are particularly vulnerable to rape: girls and peasant women in emergency zones.
This remains a major problem, in view of its gravity and despite the steps taken by the State.
Sexual discrimination combined with ethnic discrimination - since the majority of the women raped are from the Sierra region - have meant that silence prevails.
97. Sixty per cent of pregnancies among girls aged 12 to 14 are the result of incestuous relations or sexual violence committed by family members or persons close to the family (V√°squez, 1993).
98. Both the legal system and steps taken by the State and society have not been sufficient to prevent and punish the various forms of sexual aggression against women, boys and girls.
Mechanisms for assistance are centred in the legal and social counselling services of feminist NGOs, which number no more than three in Lima.
99. The responses provided by the Peruvian legal system include expansion or reduction of the penalty based on the victim's age and even allow the aggressor to be exempted from punishment if the victim agrees to marry him.
100. With regard to participation in the judiciary, the presence of women in legal decision-making bodies greatly promotes better understanding of the problem of violence against women.
The Supreme Court, the highest body of the Judicial Branch, counts two women out of a total of 24 members.
In the High Courts women account for 20 per cent and have a greater impact by serving as judges than as presidents or magistrates.
Women's representation in the judicial branch has improved since 1986: the number of women who hold positions has increased throughout the branch, except in the Supreme Court.
CONSEQUENCES OF TERRORIST ACTIONS
The group's implantation in both the countryside and the city grew steadily, until it controlled a number of zones throughout the national territory.
It was reinforced after 1987 with an influx of drug trafficking money, the result of an alliance with cocaine dealers from the Alto Huallaga valley (located in the Peruvian jungle).
Abimael Guzm√°n was captured in September 1992, together with other top leaders of the organization.
As a result of these captures and thanks to the anti-terrorism policy, particularly the Ley de Arrepentimiento (Repentance Act), the terrorist activities of Sendero have receded.
102. The second agent of violence is the Tupac Amar√∫ Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
Less formidable than the first group, it launched its activities in 1984.
It was heavily implanted in the Central Huallaga Valley, where it established an alliance with drug traffickers.
It also carried out raids in the central Sierra region and Lima. It is now in the process of disintegration.
103. About 10 per cent of the members of the armed forces are women, but they are not assigned to armed interventions.
104. The phenomenon of extreme violence has had serious repercussions for the population in general and for women in particular.
105. By staying in communities exposed to violence, peasant women have been subjected to robbery, looting, crime, torture, the burning of crops, sexual abuse, etc.
Women and girls from the native territories of the central jungle region have borne the greatest impact of the violence practiced by terrorist groups (Peru: National Report on Women, Agriculture and Rural Development).
Victims of terrorist violence
106. Of the total number of victims of terrorist violence in the period 1982 to 1993, 6 per cent, or around 1,000, were women. The remaining 94 per cent were men.
108. Women represented 12 per cent of the civilian population that succumbed to violence from 1982 to 1993 and 17.7 per cent in the period 1992 to 1993.
109. When reference is made to civilian deaths, these were primarily peasant men and women who died during the first years of terrorist violence, during which entire villages were massacred.
It must be recalled that in the first five years, terrorist activity was centred almost exclusively in rural areas.
The highest death toll among the civilian population was from 1984 to 1985 (over 2,000); 13 per cent were women.
110. After 1986, while the peasants continued to be the main victims, other sectors of the civilian population (professional workers, politicians and leaders, housewives, shopkeepers and students) were likewise affected.
111. In 1992-1993, when Sendero Luminoso's activities expanded to encompass the city, the number of women victims was greater than in the rest of the decade (18 per cent of the civilian population): it included peasant women (50 per cent), housewives (18 per cent), professional workers (13 per cent), students (6 per cent) and leaders of grass-roots organizations from urban neighbourhoods (6 per cent).
Sendero and women's grass-roots organizations
112. With the installation of Sendero Luminoso in the shanty towns of Lima, women leaders of women's organizations became the targets for terrorist attacks.
From 1990 to 1993, Sendero assassinated 11 women leaders, 16 per cent of all the leaders who were killed in political violence. Among them was Mar√≠a Elena Moyano, leader of the Federaci√≥n Popular de Mujeres in Villa El Salvador and a tenacious opponent of Sendero's violent actions.
Women displaced by terrorist violence
113. From 1983 to 1992, around 600,000 persons, or 120,000 families, were forced to migrate.
Fifty-four per cent moved within their departments, while 46 per cent migrated elsewhere.
The displaced population is currently located mainly in the outskirts of Lima, the cities of Jun√≠n and Ayacucho in the Sierra region, the coastal department of Ica and the central jungle region.
114. The displaced population is marked by having been uprooted and having experienced extreme poverty and racial and cultural marginalization.
These disadvantages, and the reduction in terrorist violence, have meant that repatriation to the place of origin is the preferable solution for just over half of all displaced persons (Coral, 1994).
For displaced persons from the jungle ethnic groups, such as the Ashaninkas, repatriation is essential to material and cultural self-defence.
115. Some groups have already returned to their communities, but the following major problems have emerged:
a) the need to reconstruct ravaged areas (infrastructure, economy, social organization);
b) the limits of security mechanisms, which principally consist of peasant self-defence patrols coordinated with the armed forces;
c) the tension and suspicion generated by past violence.
Displaced women
116. It is women who are most frequently subjected to forced displacement.
Though there are no nationalwide figures, a number of sources (Tamayo, 1992 and CEPRODEP, 1992) point to a majority of women in the displaced population.
117. Seventy-eight per cent of heads of household in displaced families are women. Many of them have taken on this role after the death, disappearance or recruitment of their spouses or, having migrated together with their spouses, after having been left alone by their spouse's subsequent abandonment, separation or death.
The figure is higher among women who migrated within their department of origin than in the case of those who moved from one department to another.
118. Displacement has had grave consequences for the lives of these women:
a) Lack of protection, insufficiency and disappearance of the rights that devolved from the spouse, considered the head of the family;
b) Work overload: they have more tasks and roles to fulfil, compounded by the increased abuse and danger derived from their position as displaced persons;
c) Suspension of health care, despite the physical and psychological toll taken on them;
d) Difficulty in participating in organizations owing to their many tasks, use of native languages and their frequent lack of reading and writing skills;
e) Male guardianship: Documents tend to be provided for men, who usually restrict their spouses' freedom of movement and participation in organizations; these displaced women are accustomed to forming a couple or having sexual relations for protection's sake, and not of their own volition;
f) Hostility and indifference in the new environment, turning women into the subject of jokes and the object of scorn, abuse and aggression (Tamayo, 1992).
119. Nevertheless, in some cases displacement has apparently led to an improvement in the situation of women with their incorporation into the world of work and into women's grass-roots organizations.
This is feasible as a function of internal displacement, where the problems of ethnic and cultural marginalization are relatively minor.
Coral (1994) stresses the greater sense of initiative and legitimacy acquired by displaced women when they transcend their traditional roles and become head of the family and/or interlocutors of State and societal institutions.
This is the case with the women from Ayacucho who make up the Federation of Mother's Clubs, 40 per cent of whom are displaced persons (around 30,000 women).
Disappeared persons
120. In ten years of terrorist violence (1983-1993), there were 3,220 recorded cases of persons allegedly detained or disappeared, and 12 per cent of these were women.
Seventy-one per cent of them have not been found.
121. According to APRODEH, 89 cases of detention or disappearance were reported in 1993, 9 of them involving women; they have not been found.
According to the same source, the number of detained or displaced persons has considerably declined in comparison with the previous year, when 391 cases were reported.
Women in Sendero Luminoso
122. Women are active in Sendero Luminoso principally by fulfilling logistical, political, operational and military functions (Mavila, 1992).
Sendero states that 40 per cent of its members are women (Kirk, 1993).
123. According to statistics from the National Penitentiary Institute, 14.4 per cent of those in prison for the crime of terrorism from 1986 to 1990 were women.
In 1993, when many important captures were made, the proportion reportedly increased to around 33 per cent (Kirk, 1993).
124. In 1990, the crime of terrorism was the second cause of incarceration of women (12 per cent of the female prison population), after illicit drug trafficking (62 per cent).
125. Terrorist women have a higher level of education than their male counterparts.
A study carried out in 1989 showed that 56.7 per cent of the women convicted of terrorism had received some university education, and 10 per cent held a doctoral or postgraduate degree.
Among the men, 31.4 per cent had some university education and 3.9 per cent held a doctoral or postgraduate degree (Ch√°vez de Paz, 1989).
ARTICLE 3
MECHANISMS FOR THE PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN
126. The Committee for the Revaluation of Women was set up within the Ministry of Education in 1972 during the regime of General Velasco Alvarado.
Three other institutions were subsequently established within separate Ministries: in the Ministry of Justice (1983-1986-1994); the Ministry of Foreign Relations (1986); and in the National Planning Institute, where this body had the status of an advisory council (1986).
127. The institutions created within the Ministry of Justice and the National Planning Institute (INP) opened the door to the involvement of civil society, marking a trend towards the formulation of public, not just governmental, policy.
It should be noted that these institutions were not integrated into higher decision-making circles and lacked the staff and financial resources to become a real springboard for the advancement of women, as they were limited in their ability to carry out promotional activities, monitor policies, mobilize resources and connect with grass-roots organizations.
They remained in existence for intermittent, generally short, periods.
128. On the other hand, the Ad Hoc Commission on Women's Rights established in 1986 made two outstanding contributions: first, the creation of the women's police offices, the first mechanism for demanding the implementation of certain rights in Peru; and the second, a new exercise in policy formulation in which women working for the advancement of women were convened to carry out analyses and to discuss specific proposals.
129. The Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights, established within the Ministry of Justice in 1994, has filled the vacuum created by the dissolution in 1990 of the earlier Commission.
130. The institutions of civil society had a major impact in the country's capital.
In the first half of the 1980s, their activities expanded to cover the entire nation. State mechanisms
131. At present, the State institution for policy formulation and monitoring is the Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights within the Ministry of Justice.
The State also has proposals, plans and programmes relating to women, there being a distinction between those that are now operational and those that were in effect for many years.
National institutions that are now operational
Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights
131. This is an institution of the National Council for Human Rights, which answers, administratively and operationally, to the Higher Directorate of the Ministry of Justice (the Minister), and budgetarily, to the National Directorate for Legal Affairs in the above-mentioned sector.
It was established in January 1994 for the purpose of carrying out studies and research on the existence, promotion and full exercise of women's and children's rights and to propose to the National Council for Human Rights legislative and other measures for realizing these objectives.
It also has the functions of developing and proposing mechanisms for coordination with national and international organizations involved in the promotion of the rights of women and children and of disseminating information on this subject.
132. The Commission is currently headed by a Vice-Minister representing the Minister of Justice, who in return represents Peru in the Inter-American Commission of Women.
This Commission brings together representatives of various institutions of State and civil society, including the Catholic Church, private companies, women's NGOs represented by the Women's Consortium and organizations dealing with children's rights.
133. At the national level, the National Population Council has created a number of regional population councils, bringing together representatives of civil society and the State to define population policies, and women are represented in these organs.
PLANS AND PROGRAMMES
National Programme for the Advancement of Women, 1991-1995
134. This is one of the seven subprogrammes making up the National Population Programme of the National Population Council (CONAPO).
Its implementation is the responsibility both of the State and of the institutions of civil society which promote it through the national network for the promotion of women.
135. The programme was elaborated at the end of the previous Government's term (1985-1990) with the assistance of State representatives as well as professional women and women's organizations convened by CONAPO.
The process of formulating the programme was a useful experiment involving nationwide consultation and the participation of women's organizations.
136. Its general objectives are: a) To promote awareness at national level of the current situation of discrimination against and subordination of women; b) To promote the integration of women under conditions of freedom and equality of rights, duties and opportunities and without gender discrimination at all levels and areas through their aware and organized involvement; and c) To create and support an autonomous system to link women's organizations and groups at national level.
137. To achieve these general objectives, specific targets were set in nine crucial areas: family life, productive activity, housing, education and culture, health, violence against women, political participation, the image of women in the mass media and information on women.
Ongoing sectoral programmes
Ministry of Health
138. It has programmes aimed at maternal and child health (perinatal and maternal and child health); family planning programmes; development programmes on women, health and development; and programmes on the health of schoolchildren and adolescents.
Ministry of the Interior

It has been operating since 1994 with the following objectives: a) To care for, entertain and feed children properly while their mothers are working; b) To faciliate the tasks of women who work or would like to work; and c) To give paying jobs to women involved in child care/education and those who help to organize the people's restaurants.
The goal is the establishment of 5,000 Wawahuasis nationwide by the year 1995.
141. The Programme for Life is carried out jointly by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education.
It is a module comprising literacy, health awareness, nutrition and income generation and is aimed at women's organizations in three departments of the Sierra region: Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac and Cusco.
Ministry of Agriculture
142. The Land Titling Programme (PET) grants women the right to hold property when they are directly responsible for its management.

144. Coordination of the technical cooperation network for organizations and institutions for the promotion of rural women, sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and comprising public, private and technical cooperation bodies.
Ministry of Fisheries
145. A project for small-scale fishing that provides women with training and loans.
Ministry of the Presidency
146. The National Programme for Food Aid (PRONAA) was established in 1992 and is active in many areas of the country.
It seeks to improve the nutritional level of the most impoverished groups through the provision of foodstuffs.
It receives funding from the Public Treasury and international cooperation, being the counterpart of food projects sponsored by the latter.
147. Family planning, maternal and child health and prevention programmes are sponsored by the National Compensation and Social Development Fund (FONCODES).
148. During the period 1980 to 1985 intensive activities were carried out by COOPOP to dynamize programmes on child and family care.
Women took part in "family kitchens" as health promoters, providers of basic education and beneficiaries of training activities and some production workshops.
COOPOP is currently operating as part of the State apparatus.
Ministry of the Presidency and municipalities
149. The ""glass of milk"" programme has been in operation since 1984; it is coordinated by the municipalities and the ""glass of milk"" committees and is funded by the above-mentioned ministry.
Established upon the initiative of the municipal governments (1983-1986), it is nationwide in scope.
Its objective is to provide a glass of milk every day to children under six years of age and to pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Since 1986 this programme has been officially incorporated in the national budget.
From January to August 1992, it accounted for 27 per cent of the total budget allocated to poverty alleviation programmes, the equivalent of 35 million soles.
National Institute for Family Wellbeing - INABIF
150. The Institutional Programme for Teenage Mothers provides assistance and protection to abandoned teenage mothers and their children, aiming at the integral development of both mother and child through services specifically geared to this objective.
It assists teenage mothers aged 12 to 17 and their children.
151. The Wawa Wasis programme (Quechua term for children's home) promotes physiological, psychological and social care for children under four years of age through day care centres for children in marginalized urban areas whose mothers work.
Four hundred such centres are administered by INABIF nationwide.
152. The Community Centres for Life and Peace (CC VIPAZ) are located in marginalized urban and rural areas.
There are currently 27 CC VIPAZ nationwide, 14 of them in Lima-Callao and the remainder throughout the country.
These centres carry out integrated community service programmes (nutrition, education, health, sanitation, legal counsel and recreation) and the development of self-management techniques (income generation through training in production and marketing and the creation of microenterprises).
Ministry of Labour
153. A sectoral committee created in 1992 is responsible for reviewing regulations on women's work.
Since 1975 it has been carrying out studies on the female labour force.
Presidency of the Council of Ministers

Peruvian Social Security Institute (IPSS)
155. This independent public entity carries out the family planning programme.
Organizations and programmes in operation during the past decade
156. A number of State institutions and programmes began or ceased operating during the past decade.
Their predecessors were the Committee for the Revaluation of Women (1972), which had the objective of formulating policy for multisectoral efforts to promote the revaluation of women, and the National Commission for Peruvian Women (1974), which united all women's organizations in an office for the conduct of research, the implementation of promotional activities and the handling of legal issues.
Machinery at the national level
Ministry of Justice
157. The Office for Women was established in 1983 for the purpose of coordinating, among the various sectors and with international assistance, governmental efforts to benefit women.
It was also to have been the National Secretariat for Women.
It has since been abolished. 158. The Ad Hoc Commission on Women's Rights, whose objective was to promote mechanisms for guaranteeing the exercise of women's rights in Peru, engaged primarily in the following activities: i) dissemination of materials and information on the rights of women; ii) legal aid and counselling within the women's police offices, police departments staffed exclusively by female police officers established in 1988 to give aid and protection to abused women and abandoned and abused children; and iii) policy formulation.
159. The Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights established in October 1993 under Supreme Decree No. 038-93-JUS is still functioning.
Ministry for Foreign Affairs
160. The Office for Women's Affairs was established in 1988 and subsequently expanded its functions to cover children's issues as well.
For that reason it was renamed the Department of Women's and Children's Affairs.
Following the restructuring of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, this Department became the Office for Women's and Children's Affairs, and it is still functioning in the above-mentioned fields, providing support to the bodies of the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the Chancellery of Inter-American Affairs.
National Planning Institute (independent public institution)
161. This Institute established an advisory council for the promotion of women which was made up of women from various sectors of public administration and from NGOs for the purpose of developing public policy for incorporation in development plans.
Sectoral and multisectoral programmes
162. The programme for demographic education, which was given advisory services by UNESCO, was set up in 1983 with the objective of promulgating in both primary and secondary schools the idea of equality between men and women.
163. In 1987, the Committee on Population, the Family and Women was established as an advisory body to the Ministry of Education.
164. Programmes for food distribution to organized women's groups through the National Office for Food Aid (ONAA), currently part of PRONAA.
165. A number of food aid programmes were carried out through ONAA, many of them with donations from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), European economic cooperation and assistance from other contributors.
Noteworthy among these programmes is the project for integrated nutritional development (PRODIA), using foodstuffs donated by AID through the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE).
166. A pilot project for promotion of women's economic activities in one urban and one rural area.
167. The National Programme for Family Planning and maternal and child health care programmes.
National Population Council
168. During the governmental regime of 1985-1990, the Programme for the Advancement of Women and Strengthening of the Family was established.
It has become the present national network for the advancement of women and is operating independently.
Presidency of the Republic
169. Direct Assistance Programme (PAD).
This was directly administered by the President of the Republic (1985-1990) and carried out three types of activities: people's canteens, production workshops and basic educational centres through the mothers' clubs.
These clubs are presently administered by PRONAA (National Programme for Food Aid).
170. In addition, programmes that were not originally intended for women but ended up involving primarily women were carried out, including the Temporary Income Support Programme (PAIT).
Other multisectoral programmes
171. The Food Aid programme for mothers and children (PAMI) was carried out by agreement with the World Food Programme and the United Nations Development Fund for Women.
This was a comprehensive programme combining a women's literacy campaign, primary health care and a production component as a precondition for receiving food aid.
It is now being carried out under PRONAA. NGOs
172. Non-governmental organizations have been well represented in Peru since the mid-1970s.
They are expanding just as the State's efforts are being restricted and external resources are being received from international cooperation.
173. In 1990, there were 703 NGOs, 57 per cent of them in the department of Lima.
In 1993, 895 NGOs were registered throughout the country, 110 working on projects relating exclusively to women or inclusive of women in their action plans.
174. Of a total of 77 NGOs that work with women, 42 do so on an exclusive basis and 35 incorporate the situation of women into their programmes.
The activities of these NGOs are mainly directed towards the promotion of grass-roots organizations (people's canteens, mothers' clubs, "glass of milk" committees), both in the country and in the city.
175. The principal areas of concentration in the past have been training in health and nutritional matters, management, leadership and handicrafts.
In second place are activities designed to improve the productive capacity of grass-roots organizations (home garden plots, small animal husbandry, food preparation).
Involvement in this type of production or income generation project has been increasing over this decade and has now become an area of priority.
176. A survey carried out among NGOs that make up the Network for Rural Women as well as those NGOs that, without being part of this Network, engage in activities involving rural women, has provided a general picture of the nature of their activities.
177. The principal objectives pursued by rural NGOs include: cultural diversity, income generation, rural development, irrigation and technical irrigation works, decision-making, literacy, organization and management.
Many of these projects are short-term in nature and are carried out in certain departments on the coast and in the Sierra region; few are carried out nationwide.
178. Priority is given first to support for the organizations, then to rural development projects on production, output and income generation and projects devoted specifically to the cultural demands of women's groups.
179. The 1980s brought major changes in the nature of projects: some explicitly acknowledged women as social agent and beneficiary and others involved them without reference to their specific demands.
Networks and coordinating institutions
180. In the late 1980s, networks and coordinating institutions comprising non-governmental organizations, women's organizations and other bodies were created.
181. Eight networks made up of NGOs that work with women in such areas as food provisionment, health, education and the rural sector are currently operating in Lima.
Networks and coordinating institutions for Lima or based in Lima
National Network for the Advancement of Women
182. This is a non-profit-making institution that operates nationwide.
It was set up in March 1990 at a meeting where the National Programme for the Advancement of Women was adopted.
Its goal is to monitor the implementation of the National Programme for the Advancement of Women and to encourage activities for the promotion of women.
183. The following are considered to be the Network's functions: a) to advise central government institutions and those of regional and local governments on policies to overcome women's subordination and marginalization and on the implementation and evaluation of the Programme; b) to coordinate the implementation of the Programme with the responsible institutions of the central government and regional and local governments; c) to provide advice and coordinate with the organizations of civil society involved in the implementation of the Programme; d) to mobilize and support women's organizations with a view to their participation in the National Network and in the implementation and evaluation of the National Programme.
184. It has a National Governing Council and macroregional and departmental coordinating units throughout the country.
National Network for Rural Women
185. Established in 1988, it is organized by the Flora Trist√°n Centre for Peruvian Women and comprises NGOs working in this field.
It also coordinates with women in national peasants' guilds.
Women's Network for Grass-roots Education
186. Consists of five NGOs and is for the purpose of coordinating activities in this area. It is affiliated with the Latin American Council for Adult Education (CEAAL).
Women's Consortium
187. Made up of five NGOs for women or doing work with women (Manuela Ramos, Flora Trist√°n, CENDOC Mujer, Centre for Studies and Publications-CESIP and Peru-Mujer) for the purpose of joint management of large-scale projects.
Radio Coordinating Body
188. Comprises five NGOs (Manuela Ramos, Flora Trist√°n, Calandria, Micaela Bastidas-Trujillo and Amauta-Cusco) that have radio transmission programmes aimed at women.

191. Made up of 19 private associations, many of which work exclusively with women or have programmes of work involving women.
Networks and coordinating bodies in other departments
192. A number of experiments are ongoing in the coordination of the work carried out by NGOs and women's organizations and groups in the departments of Piura, Lambayeque, Ancash, Tacna, San Mart√≠n, Ayacucho, Junin, Cusco and Puno.
193. Some of the initiatives originate in women's institutions and NGOs that have projects involving women and others have grown out of the creation of the National Network for the Advancement of Women (CENTRO, 1993).
Thematic groups 194. These are bodies for coordination on specific topics under the heading of women's issues; they were created for the most part in the late 1980s and comprise individuals from a variety of institutions who share working experiences and an interest in a subject.
Most of them operate solely in Lima. 195. The major thematic groups include the Standing Forum on Women and Politics, which was developed by women's institutions as a forum for communication among women involved in the promotion of women and women holding political positions, especially those in Parliament.
196. There is also the Peruvian section of the Latin American Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM) which deals with the rights of women.
197. The working group on urban services and women in low-income groups (SUMBI) deals with women and social services and policies.
It has been in Lima for nine years and has established similar groups in Cusco and Trujillo.
Family Planning Institutions
198. These provide information, advice, training and services in family planning.
They do not necessarily have a gender perspective.
199. At the national level there are currently more than a dozen NGOs working in the area of family planning.
A distinction may be drawn between those that promote only natural methods and are affiliated with the Catholic Church and those that promote all contraceptive methods.
On the basis of their diversity of services and coverage, the following are noteworthy:
Support for Population Programmes (APROPO)
200. An NGO founded in 1983.
It is currently nationwide in scope and carries out mass communication programmes (radio, television and press), marketing programmes (promotion of brands of contraceptives, chiefly pills) and telephone counselling.

ARTICLE 4
208. Since the promulgation of Act No. 2851, "Employment of girls and women by third parties", legislation has been adopted in favour of women to provide them with certain benefits.
Among the special measures that may be applied in the area of women's rights are those aimed at protecting mothers.
209. With respect to the protection of mothers, article 45 of the 1979 Constitution stated that protection must be provided to working mothers.
The same theme has been incorporated in the 1993 Constitution, which states in article 23 that the State shall provide special protection to mothers.
210. Pregnant women have the right to 90 days of leave, 45 before and 45 after parturition, and these days are, exceptionally, counted as actual working days and thus cannot be deducted from the total length of service.
They are also counted as actual working days for the purpose of calculating vacation time.
Mothers have the right to nurse a child for one hour each day during the infant's first year.
211. An additional benefit for working mothers, perhaps one of the most significant, is the nursery services provided for under articles 20 and 21 of Act No. 2851.
Employers must make available, either on their facilities or in other facilities close to the workplace, a room specially adapted for the care of children by working women during working hours, but only for the child's first year.
213. Employers must provide nursery services whenever they have more than 25 women workers or employees who are over 18 years of age (Article 26 of the Supreme Decree dated 25 June 1921).
Mothers with children in these services can use blocks of time not to exceed a total of one hour a day to nurse them.
214. This time period cannot be discounted from the mother's earnings, irrespective of the form of remuneration given for her work.
It is also provided that if a pregnant women is dismissed by her employer solely on the grounds of her pregnancy, she may make a legal petition for the dismissal to be invalidated, and if the judge decides in her favour, she must be reinstated in her job immediately (articles 65 (e) and 71 of Legislative Decree No. 728).
215. If a women is dismissed in the three months preceding or following parturition, and irrespective of whether the dismissal is justified or not, the employer must pay an indemnity of 90 daily wages, without prejudice to any compensation that might be provided for in the employment contract (article 18 of Act No. 2851).
216. When the mother does piecework and is not paid for the hour to nurse her child provided for by law, the employer must pay her an indemnity and such bonuses or other remunerations as are envisaged for such work (articles 22 and 27 of the Supreme Decree dated 25 June 1921).
217. In respect of social security, an act promulgated on 16 July 1987 includes housewives and mothers in the social security scheme, to which end they must contribute 5 per cent of the minimum wage every month.
218. Under Decree-Law No. 22482, social security coverage has been expanded, and to this end, recipients are divided into two categories: compulsory and voluntary.
The first includes those that have an employer, either in public or private economic activity (article 2 (a)).
A woman worker or employee receives the benefits offered by this legislation on a compulsory basis.
219. These benefits consist of cash allowances for maternity and nursing.
During the 90 days preceding and following parturition, the employer is obliged to pay the above-mentioned maternity allowance, which is due as from 45 days preceding the birth and must continue to be paid for 45 days after the birth, providing that the recipient refrains from all remunerated work (article 28 of Decree-Law No. 22482).
220. This allowance is to be provided whenever the social security recipient has made at least three consecutive monthly contributions or four non-consecutive monthly contributions over the six months preceding the expected date of delivery and was enrolled in the Peruvian Institute for Social Security (IPSS) at least nine months prior to the expected date of delivery, except in substantiated cases of premature birth (article 19 of Decree-Law No. 22482).
221. The amount of the daily maternity allowance is equivalent to the average daily insured remunerations for the final four calendar months preceding the month in which the maternity allowance is first paid.
If the total number of months is less than four, the average is determined on the basis of the total number of months insured (article 29 of Decree-Law No. 22482).
222. The above-mentioned allowance must be paid directly by the employer for subsequent reimbursal by the Peruvian Institute for Social Security (IPSS) (Supreme Decree No. 029-84-PCM and IPSS Directorate Accord No. 2, thirty-fifth regular session, 23 August 1984).
223. The Peruvian Institute for Social Security (IPSS) provides a nursing allowance for each child to an insured mother or anyone taking charge of her child in the event of her death.
The allowance is provided in the form of milk coupons or in cash until the child is eight months old.
The amount of the allowance is 25 per cent of one-thirtieth of the monthly minimum wage for metropolitan Lima.
The allowance is payable even when the mother has engaged in salaried labour (articles 22 and 30 of Decree-Law No. 22482 and Supreme Decree No. 029-84-PCM).
224. The mother's right to request the maternity or nursing allowance in cash payments expires six months after the date of expiry of the period provided for each allowance - 90 days for the maternity allowance and eight months of age of the child for the nursing allowance (article 40 of Decree-Law No. 22482).
225. With regard to retirement, Decree-Law No. 19990, which defines the national pension system in Peru, establishes a woman's right to retirement as from 55 years of age.
The same provision provides this benefit for men after 60 years of age.
226. On the other hand, article 4 of Decree-Law No. 20530 on the pension and compensation system for civil servants who have worked for the State and are not covered under Decree-Law No. 19990 states that a worker acquires pension rights after 15 years of real and remunerated service, in the case of a man, and after 12.5 years in the case of a woman.
Article 5 of this Decree-Law states that severance pay and subsistence allowances shall be established on the basis of a maximum work cycle of 30 years for men and of 25 years for women.
227. In terms of restrictions, article 6 of Act No. 2851 indicates that women who are minors (i.e. aged less than 18) are prohibited from engaging in night work (from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m.).
It must be specified that our legislation generally considers night work to be work done from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.: this is stipulated, inter alia, in article 2, para. 1, of ILO Conventions Nos. 41 and 42, on employment of women during the night, to which Peru is a signatory.
228. Women who are minors are also prohibited from working on Sundays and public holidays [except] if employed in the following occupations:
a. Those run by the family itself with no involvement whatsoever of non-family members, and under the supervision and authority of their parents or guardians.
b. Domestic service.
c. Farming, as long as [no] running motors are used.
229. It is likewise prohibited for women who are minors to work in the following occupations (articles 19 and 20 of the Supreme Decree of 25 June 1921):
a. Sale of newspapers.
b. Sale of magazines and lottery tickets.
c. Shoe shining.
d. Distribution of programmes and pamphlets.
e. Sale of flowers and candies.
f. All other ambulatory occupations carried out in public places, excepting in kiosks and fixed stands.
Articles 12 and 17 of the Supreme Decree of 25 June 1921 also prohibit women from engaging in underground, mining and quarry work.
Additional prohibitions:
a. Cleaning of moving machinery and running motors.
b. Construction, repair, cleaning and painting of buildings if scaffolding is required and the work is done at an altitude exceeding ten metres.
c. Loading and unloading of maritime vessels using cranes and derricks and involving excessive loads.
d. Metal foundry.
e. Use of circular saws.
f. Production, use or transport of flammable, explosive or toxic substances.
g. Any job at a site where explosive, flammable or caustic substances are produced, handled or stored in dangerous quantities or where powders or vapours that are toxic, irritant or hazardous to health are released.
230. Under the above-mentioned article 12 of this Decree, all other occupations which, in the opinion of the Executive, may be hazardous to health or public morals should be added to this list.
231. The regulations prohibiting women from engaging in work underground and in mines must be correlated with ILO Convention No. 45 concerning Employment of Women on Underground Work in Mines of all Kinds, which Peru ratified in Legislative Resolution No. 10195.
232. Other benefits and duties are also covered in Peruvian labour legislation:
1. Employers are obliged to furnish seating so that women may work in a comfortable position, such seating to be different from that reserved for the public (article 19 of Act No. 2851).
2. Women who do sewing work at home must receive a salary at least equivalent to an official daily wage of women employed in workshops.
If the work is remunerated on a piecemeal basis, the official daily wage must be its equivalent (article 28 of Act No. 2851).
3. Public recourse may be taken against violators of Act No. 2851, which regulates employment of women by third parties.
All institutions involved in the protection of mothers have the authority to take such action (article 30 of Act No. 2851).
4. Provincial institutions and provincial authorities are responsible for ensuring strict compliance with the regulations intended to benefit women, failing which, and following a medical examination that shows that the work is damaging to the woman's health, the highest political authority in the province, the judge of the court of first instance or the mayor may order a work cessation (article 31 of Act No. 2851).
5. The designation of any honor, academic grade, professional title, office, public function, job, employment or other vocational or labour activity, whatever its origin or level, shall be expressed, when it relates to women, in the feminine gender if such is grammatically possible (Act No. 24310).
6. The law takes account of the situation of domestic workers, who are protected by Supreme Decree No. 23-DT of 30 April 1957.
Under Supreme Decree No. 002-70-TR, they are accorded the right to vacation time, compensation for length of service and a minimum rest period at night.
7. The Ministry of Labour and Social Advancement is responsible for periodically carrying out special employment programmes in the various employment categories.
Among the potential beneficiaries of such programmes are women with family responsibilities, i.e. all women who, irrespective of their age or civil status, have family responsibilities and are prepared to do part-time or short-term work.
8. In this case, the programmes have to take account of the time available to these workers, their job qualifications, their socio-economic environment and their suitability for the jobs offered by enterprises as a function of fluctuations in market demand (articles 131 (a) and 134 of Legislative Decree No. 728).
9. Women workers and employees subject to the labour regime for private economic activity have the right to a salary increment of 25 per cent after 25 years of service to a single employer.
After 30 years of service, the increment increases to 30 per cent of their salaries (Act No. 24504).
However, the Third and Final Transitional Provision of Legislative Decree No. 688 eliminated the increment for 25 years of service for those workers and employees whose employment contracts began after the legislative decree had entered into force.
10. The law provides that all telephone operators, irrespective of the enterprise, company or office where they work, must be considered commercial employees and cannot, accordingly, be considered wage earners (Supreme Decree of 17 May 1929).
11. An individual who works at home, that is, one who carries out his or her work in his or her domicile, receives both the maternity allowance and the nursing allowance, on account of being covered by the National Pension System under Decree-Law No. 19990, as well as by the health care regime under Act No. 22482 (article 164 of Decree-Law No. 728).
12. Women who are authorized to provide nighttime services as waitresses in hotels, bars and restaurants must have a special permit, provided free of charge by the General Labour Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour (Supreme Decree of 9 December 1930).
13. The State ensures compliance with the regulations concerning women's work by carrying out periodic inspections in workplaces and thereby determining whether the law is being applied faithfully (Supreme Decree of 17 January 1936).
14. Under the law, housewives or homemakers are regarded as independent workers (Act No. 24705).
233. The concept of indemnification covers both indemnification for work accidents and indemnification for unjustified dismissal.
In the first case, if the victim of the accident is a woman, the indemnification is 25 per cent higher (article 9 of Act No. 2851).
234. In the second case, that is, indemnification for unjustified dismissal, a woman receives additional benefits, in that the employer must supplement her total social benefits by the equivalent of two monthly wages.
This is stated in the final portion of the sole article in Act No. 4239 of 26 March 1921.
235. The normal working day consists of eight hours, with 48 hours in a week (article 25 of the 1993 Constitution).
For women, the working day is not to exceed eight hours, 45 hours in a week (Article 5, Act No. 2851).
During the working day, women are to have two consecutive hours free at midday.
When women have to work on a Saturday afternoon, their working hours are not to exceed five, with time off on the Monday if it is not a holiday.
The daily wages must be the same as the usual daily wages (article 11 of Act No. 2851, as amended by the sole article of Act No. 4239; article 8 of Act No. 2851).
POLICY STATEMENTS
EDUCATIONAL POLICY 237. The objective is to eliminate illiteracy and women's disadvantages compared to men in access to education at all levels in order better to integrate women into economic, political and social life, using integrated literacy programmes that have an impact on their job training and prepare them to take on responsibilities in daily life.
In order to achieve this goal, the following are required:
a) To strengthen and expand integrated literacy programmes for illiterate adults.
b) To launch a technical training subsystem to improve the qualifications of the female labour force, promote equality of opportunity and treatment and provide access for young people to non-traditional technical careers.
c) To disseminate awareness of gender perspectives at the university level in order to promote equality of opportunity and treatment and the access of young people to non-traditional scientific careers.
d) To expand coeducational opportunities in all public and private educational institutions as a means of training children and adolescents in a social context of equality, without gender distinctions.
e) To develop new integrated curricula in initial, primary and secondary schools, removing stereotypes of male and female behaviour and promoting cultural reaffirmation in order to eradicate racism; to ensure more equitable sharing of responsibilities within the family, encouraging solidarity, tolerance and communication in family life; to reinforce self-esteem and education for life and peace.
f) To eliminate stereotypes of male and female behaviour and reaffirm national cultural values through new learning methods and pedagogical techniques, as well as through the production of modules for pedagogical materials and methodological guidelines.
g) To incorporate gender awareness in teachers' training programmes in order to eliminate stereotypes of male and female behaviour and to reaffirm national cultural values.
h) To provide mechanisms whereby women teachers may take on administrative positions.
i) To inflict severe punishment for sexual harassment in the school.
j) To evaluate the impact on school performance of early entry by children into the job market and of the work done by girls who take responsibility for domestic tasks.
k) To promote educational programmes aimed at illiterate women in rural areas, offering them technical careers connected with farming activities.
LABOUR POLICY
238. Increased and improved integration of women into the labour market must be pursued by promoting access to essential economic instruments such as loans and technology and the modernization of the legal framework to achieve equality of opportunity and treatment, for which purpose it is necessary:
a) To establish job training policies that expand labour opportunities for mothers, promote their integration into dynamic branches of the economy and improve the training of women who are unemployed or underemployed;
b) To establish a legal framework guaranteeing the integration, stability and job promotion of both sexes under conditions of equality of opportunity.
This might comprise legislation on gender discrimination in employment, the creation of protection and monitoring mechanisms to guarantee equal pay, the development of new job descriptions in line with the principle of "Equal pay for equal work" and the consolidation of protection and monitoring mechanisms so that existing regulations protecting the rights of women are implemented.
c) To set up integrated programmes for the development of female entrepreneurship in urban areas.
POLICY ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY
239. Efforts should be made to promote the involvement of women in local and national decision-making and power structures under equitable circumstances through the effective integration of social agents and through the establishment of mechanisms to promote and facilitate the participation of women at the various levels of State and private economic decision-making and to ensure follow-up and evaluation of policies on women in the bodies that define the country's social policies.
240. For this purpose, it is also necessary to ensure that women are trained to exercise leadership at all levels of social life, with emphasis on a better understanding of women's rights and civic and political instruction for women members of political parties, parliamentarians and generators of public opinion on any given topic.
Support should also be given for the establishment and strengthening of women's organizations and collectives.
241. The above information concerning policy on education, employment and political and economic activity corresponds to the platform of action proposed in the National Report on Women (September 1994) elaborated by the Standing Commission on Women's and Children's Rights and the National Human Rights Council of the Ministry of Justice.
Article 5
MODIFICATION OF SOCIOCULTURAL PATTERNS
242. The mass media have stereotypes concerning the role of women which are manifested primarily in two ways: by assigning to women the role of homekeeper devoted to domestic tasks and the care of her children and spouse; and by depicting women as sex symbols or simply as sexual objects.
These are the primary roles assigned to women in Peru's mass media, but not the only ones.
In recent years there has been an alternative trend towards reinstating all the true dimensions of women. Thus, the professional achievements of Peruvian women are acknowledged (their holding of high-level positions, for example) and women are given a hearing in the discussion of current political and social topics.
243. In respect of the representation and influence of women at the managerial level in enterprises and industry, the mass media and advertising, statistics in the National Report on Women, drafted for the Fourth World Conference on Women, may be cited.
This report gave statistics on women in the EAP (economically active population) who hold managerial and administrative posts in Peruvian enterprises.
In 1981, only 16.2 per cent of such staff was made up of women, whereas the figure had increased to 22 per cent in 1991.
THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE FAMILY
244. Different roles have traditionally been assigned to men and women in the family.
In general terms, these roles are those of father, head of the household and source of the majority of the family's income; and mother, responsible for homemaking and household chores, as well as for carefully overseeing the way the children are raised.
245. This traditional picture has been changing over the years, for various reasons such as the gradual lifting of women's educational levels, and consequently, of their professional expectations.
The trend has been fueled by the country's increasingly tight economy, which makes it virtually imperative for a family to have an income to supplement that of the husband.
In the following table we see that the proportion of women with a secondary school or higher education had climbed to 51 per cent in 1993 from only 36.1 per cent in 1981.

246. But in some cases, women assume the role of head of the household.
This happens more frequently in the most impoverished social strata than in the higher-income groups.
The table below shows that in 1981, 22.1 per cent of heads of household were women, a situation that remained largely unchanged in 1991, when 23.3 per cent were women.
This nationwide average may be broken down to reflect the situation in urban and rural areas: 24.7 per cent in the latter, and 20.1 per cent in the former.

Article 6
STEPS TAKEN BY THE STATE TO ABOLISH PROSTITUTION
247. With respect to trafficking in women and exploitation of their prostitution, the activities punishable by law are what are referred to as pimping, pandering and sex trafficking, as stipulated in articles 179 to 182 of the Penal Code.
These articles refer to the promotion or incitement of sexual exploitation for lucrative purposes; the exploitation of illegal gains obtained by a person through prostitution or by compromising, seducing or soliciting and individual with a view to sexual relations with another person or who promotes or facilitates the travel to or from the country or the movement within the national territory of a person who engages in prostitution.
248. The penalties are magnified depending on the trafficker's relationship with the victim, the victim's age, whether violence was used and whether the trafficker is a habitual offender.
249. The Penal Code outlines the relevant penalties, stipulating that anyone who promotes or incites the prostitution of another is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.
The penalty is a minimum of four and a maximum of 12 years when committed by a relative in the fourth degree of consanguinuity or the second degree of affinity or by the spouse, companion, adoptive parent or guardian or a person in any way responsible for the victim (article 179 PC).
250. Anyone who exploits the illegal gains of a person who engages in prostitution is subjected to a custodial sentence of a minimum of three and a maximum of eight years.
If the victim is under 14 years of age or the spouse, companion, descendent or adopted child of the person or of his or her spouse or companion, or is under his or her care, the penalty is at least 12 years (article 180 PC).
251. Anyone who compromises, seduces or solicits an individual with a view to sexual relations with another person is subjected to a custodial sentence for a minimum of two and a maximum of five years.
The penalty is for a minimum of five and a maximum of 12 years when the victim is the person's spouse, concubine, descendent or adoptive child or that of his or her spouse or companion, or is under his or her care (article 181 PC).
252. Anyone who promotes or facilitates another person's travel to or from the country or movement within the Republic for the purpose of engaging in prostitution is subjected to a custodial sentence for a minimum of five and a maximum of ten years.
The penalty is for a minimum of eight and a maximum of 12 years when any of the aggravating circumstances outlined in the previous article apply (article 182 PC).
253. Supreme Decree No. 09-82-IN, published on 1 April 1982, regulates various aspects of this activity, such as the prohibition of its exercise by women who are minors and efforts to abolish prostitution.
254. This decree also regulates other matters, such as the requirement of special licences for the operation of premises for this activity, their hours and location, the requirements that must be met by prostitutes, the obligations of administrators of brothels, the work regime of their staff, health regulations, prohibition of advertising, etc.
255. Act No. 26102, published on 29 December 1992 and containing the Code of Children and Adolescents, designates the prostitution of children and adolescents as a form of enslavement by which the parents or guardians of the child or adolescent exploited for activities contrary to the law or public morals are deemed to have abandoned them.
256. As we have seen, the decree mentions the health requirements that must be met by individuals involved in this activity, including periodic check-ups for venereal disease and other transmissible diseases like AIDS.
Article 7
POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN
257. The right of women to exercise their political rights and to vote and be elected is protected by Peruvian legislation with, in the first instance, the 1993 Constitution, article 2, paragraph 2 of which enshrines the right to non-discrimination on grounds of sex or on other grounds.
Article 2, paragraph 17 proclaims the right of all persons to participate, individually or collectively, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the nation.
Article 31 sets out the right of all citizens, male and female, to vote and be elected.
258. These rights are exercised by women at all levels.
We find women participating in political affairs within political parties, as members or leaders, and in the highest spheres of government as Ministers of State, members of Congress, etc.
259. The municipality was the first opening for women's organizing skills and political participation; they formed groups to cope with extreme poverty, became the main centres of civil resistance to terrorist violence and defended their organized action, human life and peace.
The exacerbation of the economic situation and of terrorist violence made it necessary to develop communal strategies for self-defence ("glass of milk" committees and people's canteens) and defence, something which enabled women to infiltrate local and regional power circles and to develop the capacity to negotiate their demands with the central government and other authorities.
260. A movement which overturned established patterns in the arts, sex, politics and gender relations subsequently emerged: feminism.
The international community, through such bodies as the United Nations, promoted the adoption of a series of instruments and political commitments as a way of advancing the discussion relating to the protection of women against discrimination, violence and the violation of their rights.
261. The internal crisis within political parties, combined with the efforts of leaders to incorporate women in the higher spheres of adminstration and to encourage their candidacies in general elections, smoothed the path to legitimization of women's participation in politics.
262. The current regime is applying an unusual approach by giving women posts traditionally reserved for men, for example: Customs Superintendant, Attorney-General, Comptroller-General, member of the Supreme Court, Minister for Industry, for Tourism and for Integration and International Trade Negotiations, Minister of the Presidency, Vice-Minister of the Economy, Vice-Minister of Justice.
These positions confer prestige and are at a high level of political power and decision-making.
The criteria for selection relate to professional qualifications, trustworthiness, experience and efficiency in previous positions.
263. Another factor which has had a direct influence is terrorist violence and the aggravation of the economic crisis.
Terrorist violence, with its tragic toll of deaths, disappearances and forced migration, primarily of men in the case of the Andean region, is a conditioning factor for the active participation of women in communal power and decision-making forums.
Women are serving as mayors and heading peasant patrols or self-defence committees, participating actively in bodies for the protection of human rights and defence fronts.
In urban areas, especially in low-income sectors where violence has been centred, women and their organizations have become neighbourhood leaders and been the bulwark of civil resistance to terrorism.
264. Women's political participation has been a two-way street.
On the one side are women of the upper middle classes who, on the basis of their professional capabilities and political experience (political parties, entrepreneurial guilds and trade unions), have managed to penetrate, although still as a minority, governmental and State decision-making circles: Congress, public administration, ministries, the judiciary and local government.
They have also gained entry into organizations of civil society such as entrepreneurial guilds and the mass media.
265. On the other side are women of low and very low income groups in urban areas and rural areas who, by participating in self-defence bodies or other neighbourhood or community organizations, have been gaining a modicum of power within the State apparatus and have earned acceptance at some administrative levels in the organizations of civil society (political parties).
They have also run for office in general elections.
266. Despite these types of apprenticeship and the contributions of women to political life, their participation seems have hit a stalemate, and in absolute terms, it is still minimal.
267. The number of women participating in politics provides no insurance, however, that such representation is linked to their demands and aspirations or the promotion of their rights.
268. The conception of women's roles has evolved over the past decade, in terms both of women's own expectations for themselves and of society's perception of women.
Women are better prepared to compete and, while the identification of women with the domestic (private) sphere has not been supplanted, women have been accepted in public life and their leadership role has been recognized.
But what is proposed in terms of such leadership resembles political identity more than gender identity (Ochoa, Olenka, 1994).
At Government level
The right to vote 269. In the early 1980s, the new Constitution mandated the right to vote for illiterates and legal majority and the right to vote were accorded as from 18 years of age.
As a result, the electoral rolls were supplemented by over half a million illiterates and a similar number of young women.
Participation in parliamentary assemblies
270. In the 1980s, the parliamentary system was bicameral.
The percentage of women candidates and women members of the Chambers of Senators and Deputies was minimal at the start and the end of this period.
271. In 1990, the number of women elected as senators was 6.7 per cent of the total number of elected senators, whereas the number of elected deputies was 5.6 per cent of the total.
Fairly similar figures had emerged from the 1980 elections.

272. The participation of women in Parliament did not, however, translate into any perceptible increase in the leadership posts held in the chambers by the women elected.
Few of the women elected to Parliament became part of the governing bodies of their respective chambers.
Throughout the decade, only three women in the Chamber of Senators formed part of the bodies responsible for setting up the Congress (in 1980, 1985 and 1990): they held minor positions as Deputy Secretary, Second Secretary and Deputy Librarian.
273. In 1992, with the closure of Parliament, the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) was set up, comprising 80 members.
Although the number of women candidates for election did not increase at this time in comparison with previous elections, the number of women members of Congress did rise, to 8.8 per cent.
Participation in Public Administration
274. The number of women in high-level managerial posts in public administration is inferior to that of men, although it did grow steadily in the 1980s and 1990s.
275. In 1987, two women were named Ministers of State - the first such appointments ever - and given the portfolios of Education and Health.
In 1990, the Ministry of Education was again conferred on a woman.
In 1994, the same thing happened with the portfolios of Industry, Tourism, Integration and International Trade Negotiations and the Ministry of the Presidency.
Four women are currently serving as Vice-Ministers in various sectors.
276. The access of women to the posts of Director General and Executive Director increased marginally from 1983 to 1987-1988.

277. In the current restructuring of the State apparatus, it is interesting to note the growing importance of professional qualifications in the ranks of public adminstrators, and the corresponding recruitment of women professionals.
This seems to be exemplified by the significant representation of women in the National Supervisory Body for Tax Administration (SUNAT), an institution that has been modernized in recent years and in which nearly 40 per cent of the executives and 47 per cent of professionals are women.

Participation in local government
278. From 1980 to 1994, five elections were held to elect mayors and councilmen throughout the country.
Local decision-making bodies were frequently the target of terrorist attacks.
During this period, just over 400 local leaders were the victims of the actions of the Sendero Luminoso.
279. At present, only 9 of the 183 mayors of provincial municipalities are women (4.9 per cent); at the district level in the province of Lima, only 5 of 43 mayors are women (11.6 per cent).
The number of women mayors has increased since 1980, but the overall percentage remains very small.

280. In the 1980s, municipal administration became the arema for the participation and organization of women.
This was visible particularly in 1984, when the United Leftist Front (Frente de Izquierdas Unidas) won the Lima Provincial Council and the number of councilwomen increased from 4 to 7.
Municipal programmes for assistance to urban population groups reinforced women's organizations and created a new cadre of women leaders who gained ground in the social and political arena.

Participation in regional government
281. The country's regionalization, mandated by the 1979 Constitution, was an ephemeral process.
Elections were held for the first time in 1989 to form Regional Assemblies, but they have now been disbanded.
282. The representation of women in these forums was extremely limited.
In 1992, 3.9 per cent of all elected regional deputies were women.
This marked a small improvement over 1989, when of the 171 elected representatives of regional governments, only 1.8 per cent were women.
283. This low level of participation was perhaps aggravated by the persistence of gender discrimination and the heavy influence of established local decision-making groups in departments and provinces of the country's interior.

In civil society
284. The formation of an extensive and diversified women's movement is a sign of the times in this decade. In the general context of the crisis, women gained visibility through their professional work and in NGOs: feminist organizations and the new community organizations for food supply.
Yet a ceiling has been created for access to positions of power within traditional institutions: women have remained absent from the leadership of trade unions, political parties and other classical power structures. Trade unions
But its national governing body has undergone "masculinization": while in 1983, nearly half of the members were women, by 1993 their numbers had diminished.
286. The absence of women among leaders of trade unions and trade union organizations seems to be attributable, firstly, to their limited employment in the jobs classically represented by trade unions (there are fewer and fewer women workers, but more and more are entering the informal sector), and second, by the close ties between the leaders of trade unions and of political parties, primarily made up of men.

287. Owing to the violence that has swept over the country, in rural areas, particularly in the emergency zones, women have taken on positions of authority in their communities as a result of the massive migration, disappearances and deaths of their spouses and sons.
In addition, organized into peasant's patrols, they have actively participated in the defence of their communities (Amelia Fort 1993).
288. The representation of rural women in certain rural decision-making or lobbying structures such as the Rural Women's Confederation (CCP), the National Agrarian Confederation (CNA) and the ONA is still weak, being limited to the position of secretary for women's affairs, a body set up in 1988 at the "first rural women's meeting".
Political parties
289. In recent years women have begun to hold leadership positions in political parties.
290. Two women are currently in high-level positions in two major political parties (the Partido Aprista Peruano and the Partido Popular Cristiano), and a woman is the Deputy Director of the Leftist Democratic Movement.
During the decade, women have been involved in this type of organization only on a minority basis.
The relative improvements in women's position occur against the background of renewal, to some extent, of some parties, which have been obliged to reorganize in the face of reversals suffered since the late 1980s.
Professional organizations
291. In the context of the institutional crisis, professional organizations have evolved into significant civic forums.
As a result of improvements in women's professional qualifications, their representation in these organizations has been increasing, resulting in a modification of the gender balance in a large number of associations.
292. With the diversification of the fields of their professional activity, by 1990 women represented 40 per cent of members in the professional organization of accountants, and 20 to 25 per cent of members in professional organizations of physicians, lawyers, odontologists and architects.
Compared with 1983, this is an improvement in women's involvement in these professions, which have traditionally been the province of men.
293. The male contingent in fields traditionally occupied by women, such as nursing and social work, has likewise grown.
In 1994, 30 per cent of all members in such professional organizations were men.

Feminist organizations and the advancement of women
294. Because of the work done by feminist organizations and the success of women in grass-roots organizations, women have gained visibility on the public scene.
295. A number of feminist non-governmental organizations at the local and national level are working for the advancement of women and serving as advisors for feminist grass-roots organizations.
They are also involved in the dissemination of information and coordination with societal and State institutions.
296. Networks and consortia have been formed in the interests of coordination.
The most important of these are the National Network for the Advancement of Women, the National Network for Rural Women, the Women's Network for Grass-roots Education, the Women's Consortium and the Radio Coordinating Body.
Experiments are also being carried out with thematic groups such as the Peruvian section of the Latin American Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM), the Women's Network for Grass-roots Education, the Working Group for Urban Services and Women in Low-Income Groups (SUMBI), the Working Group for Women and Structural Adjustment and the Standing Forum on Women and Politics, a body that brings together feminists and women parliamentarians (Fort, 1993).
There is also a Centre for Documentation on Women.
297. In the 1990s feminists have been seeking to expand their impact to other sectors of society, without losing their ties with grass-roots organizations. Priority has been given to the following: meetings and debates with political leaders and parliamentarians, greater visibility in the mass media and convincing universities and State institutions to incorporate gender perspectives.
They are participating in the discussion of legislation and decrees that affect women and are continuing to promote the women's police offices, to train police officers and to provide legal aid in law enforcement facilities.
Background
298. In 1973, a small group of middle-class women founded ALIMUPER - Action for the Liberation of Peruvian Women.
299. In the late 1970s, the first four feminist organizations were established in Lima: the Flora Trist√°n Centre for Peruvian Women, the Manuela Ramos Movement, Women and Struggle and the Women's Socialist Front.
300. From 1978 to 1983 new feminist groupings were formed and existing ones split to create new organizations: five in Lima and a similar number in provincial cities such as Arequipa, Trujillo, Cajamarca, Chimbote and Cusco.
301. Feminist groups initially concentrated their in the areas of sexuality and feminist self-awareness. They subsequently opened up their activities to address grass-roots organization for women, women's lack of legal recourse against violence, women's health, child care, etc.
302. In 1985, feminists made an incursion into politics with the participation of two women in presidential elections as "independents" with the United Leftist Front (Frente Izquierdas Unidas).
303. In 1990, the National Network for the Advancement of Women emerged, bringing a gender perspective to the formulation of public policy to achieve the advancement of women in nine fields: health, education, culture, housing, violence, the image of women in the mass media, political participation, information on women, family life and productive activity.
In 1990 it also fostered a debate on the situation of women with candidates for parliamentary elections from the major political parties.
It has submitted to Parliament proposals for the revision of the Penal Code, including the Domestic Violence and Constitutional Reform Act.
It has expressed its views on the repression of abortion, a continuing subject of public debate.
Women Members of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
304. Women have a decisive involvement in NGOs, both because of their holding leadership positions (they make up 26 per cent of all the directors of NGOs) and because of their work in research and promotional programmes.
305. According to estimates for 1991, one third of the members in NGOs are women, concentrated more in urban areas than in rural programmes.
306. In the early 1980s, there were far fewer men and women members than in the 1990s.
The number of members increased with the growing number of projects aimed at women and at women's grass-roots organizations.
307. Of the 822 professionals working in NGOs on projects to support rural women, 36.5 per cent are women.
BREAKDOWN OF NGO MEMBERS BY SEX AND BY WORKING AREA (%)
Source: Ruiz Bravo Y Bobadilla, 1993.
* No. of cases = 205
308. In terms both of field of university specialization and of areas in which male and female members of NGOs are working, there is a clear split along gender lines.
The majority of women are educators (20.5 per cent), sociologists (17.6 per cent) and nurses (14.7 per cent), whereas men tend to be engineers (39.4 per cent).
309. There are also divergences in the types of activities undertaken.
While women are involved in programmes on health, nutrition and the training of women, young people and children, men devote their efforts to technical assistance, administration and organization (Ruiz Bravo y Bobadilla, 1993).
310. The profile of women members of NGOs in the 1990s differs from that of the early 1980s.
The first wave of members entered university in the 1970s and was influenced by utopian visions of revolution and social change.
Most were from the urban middle class and they were generally professionals in the fields of social science, letters and the humanities (sociologists and professors).
By contrast, a high proportion of current members of NGOs - around a third - comes from the disadvantaged sectors of the population and is made up of migrants seeking professional advancement.
Women's grass-roots organizations
Scope and features
311. There is currently a variety of women's grass-roots organizations for food aid: the mothers' clubs, the people's canteens and the "glass of milk" committees.
Their common feature is collective action for the purchase, preparation and daily distribution of foodstuffs with a view to reducing the cost of feeding a family.
They likewise make it possible to reduce the time spent by women on domestic tasks and function as centres for socializing, training and in some cases income generation.
312. It is estimated that in 1994, in metropolitan Lima alone there were around 15,000 such organizations, including canteens and "glass of milk" committees as well as the mothers' clubs, which are present nationwide.
The total number of self-defence organizations is calculated to be at least 20,000, and with an average of 20 women members for each, this gives a total of approximately 400,000 women in these organizations.
313. Each type of organization has its own method of centralization and of metropolitan, provincial or departmental representation, but there is no single umbrella body.
314. Women's organizations play a crucial role in the provision of food to the impoverished.
In 1990, the "glass of milk" committees served over a million people in Lima and 2,600,000 people nationwide, in other words, 8 per cent of the country's total population (Garc√≠a Naranjo, 1992).
315. In 1991, the people's canteens in metropolitan Lima prepared and distributed 570 thousand daily rations (CARE, canteen census, 1991) and served 8.5 per cent of all families and 13 per cent of all poor families (Ministry of Labour, Household Survey for Metropolitan Lima, 1992).
Sources: Estimated on the basis of CARE, 1990 and 1992; Garc√≠a Naranjo, 1992.
Recognition and legitimacy of women's grass-roots organizations
316. The substantive role played by women's grass-roots organizations in tackling the problem of food provisionment for large sectors of the population is acknowledged by society and the State.
317. Both the canteens and the "glass of milk" committees have been convened by the two previous Governments (1985-1990 and 1990-1995) to participate in the emergency programmes with a view to helping families most severely affected by the economic crisis and the adjustment policies.
318. With the support of NGOs and women parliamentarians, the central office of the people's canteens put through the adoption, in December 1990, of Act No. 25307 establishing a programme of support for the food provisionment work of grass-roots organizations.
Under this Act, the Government committed itself to funding a minimum of 65 per cent of the cost of the food provided by grass-roots organizations, including the canteens and "glass of milk" committees.
Enabling legislation for this Act is pending.
319. The organizers of the self-managing canteens have recently (June 1994) concluded an agreement with the National Programme for Food Aid (PRONAA) under which all self-managing canteens are to be included in the distribution of foodstuffs.
Ayacucho Mothers' Clubs
320. A case that deserves particular attention is that of the Ayacucho Mothers's Clubs, which were expanded and centralized against a background of armed violence.
Their objectives were to deal with the problems of self-defence, security and protection of human rights.
In 1989, the Federation of Mothers' Clubs of Huamanga (capital of the department of Ayacucho) was created, incorporating 260 mothers' clubs, and in late 1991, the Departmental Federation of Mothers' Clubs of Ayacucho was set up, comprising 1,200 clubs with 60,000 members.
321. Forty per cent of the women who are members have been displaced by terrorist violence and many of them are Quechua speakers (38 per cent) or are illiterate (37 per cent).
Under adverse conditions, with little or no preparation and bearing heavy family responsibilities (56 per cent have four children or more), they have managed to survive largely on account of the self-help mechanisms in their organizations (Survey of women in organizations, CEPRODEP, 1991).
Article 8
322. As stated in connection with the previous article, in our country men and women are equal in respect of the legal right to hold all public positions, including diplomatic posts.
Unfortunately, there are very few women ambassadors: from 1980 to the present, only four women have occupied such posts.
Women in diplomatic posts
323. From 1980 to the present, the four women who occupied such posts did so in the years 1973, 1981, 1988 and 1994.
Although it is true that the percentage of women in diplomatic service is currently higher than it was several years ago, it is not surprising that the number of women who accede to the highest posts within the service should be so small.
The reasons for this vary.
For example, the nature of a diplomatic career, requiring constant travel and changes of residence, is at variance with the mentality and roles traditionally assigned to women in our society.
324. With regard to the participation of women as representatives of the State at international events, although this tends to occur chiefly for missions involving subjects related to women or children, there has been an increase in instances when women represent the State in forums for the discussion of economic or commercial affairs, as exemplified by the work of the Minister for Industry, who by the nature of her functions has to fulfil such roles.
325. The Peruvian delegation to the recent International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo was headed by the Vice-Minister for Justice, a woman, who has recently been elected Vice-Chairman of the Inter-American Commission of Women of the Organization of American States.
Article 9
NATIONALITY
326. The Peruvian State grants men and women equal rights to acquire, change or retain their nationality, even in the event of marriage of the woman to an alien or change of nationality by her spouse.
The same principle of equality applies to the determination of her children's nationality.
327. Article 2 of the 1993 Constitution indicates that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one may be deprived of nationality.
This implies that in the instances outlined in article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the nationality of a woman is not subject to alteration.
328. For the determination of the nationality of children, article 52 of the Constitution grants women equal rights with men, stating that children born outside the territory of the Republic to Peruvian fathers or mothers shall be deemed Peruvian, providing that they are inscribed in the relevant register.
Article 10
SITUATION OF WOMEN WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION
329. Access to education is an aspiration shared by women of all social strata and ethnic and cultural groups.
Education opens the door to self-expression in Spanish, the country's official language, for those whose mother tongue is Quechua, Aymara or one of the indigeneous languages of the Amazonian jungle.
Conditions for integration in urban life and the job market are improved by attendance at primary school, and even more so, by vocational training.
At another level, education is viewed by women as giving them an advantage in terms of security and strength for their personal, family and social relations.
330. The educational profile of women is marked by contrasts, with both university training and illiteracy existing side by side.
Of every 100 women aged 15 or over, 19 have reached higher educational levels, while 18 have never attended school.
The range of differences is relatively great.
Women in the province of Lima, the capital of the Republic, average 9.6 years of education, while rural women in the department of Apur√≠mac average barely 1.9 years of school.
331. During this decade, the educational status of women as a group, and in comparison with men, has continually improved.
For example, the rates of illiteracy have dropped, school attendance rates are very similar to those of young men and women are acceding to higher education.
There are still groups that are being left behind, however, and this decade, in addition to the aggravation of the disparities between urban and rural women, has been characterized by a decline in the quality of education.
Illiteracy
332. There are currently 1,297,168 illiterate women in Peru.
They make up 73 per cent of the total number of illiterates, which shows that illiteracy in Peru is fundamentally a women's problem.
333. The rate of illiteracy applies to 18.3 per cent of all women and a much lower proportion - 7.1 per cent - of men.
There are nevertheless marked differences among women depending on their place of residence: while illiteracy affects 10 of every 100 women in urban areas, it occurs in 43 of every 100 women in rural zones.

334. There is a heavy concentration of illiterate women in the departments of the Sierra region, where the level of development is low.
This is true of Apur√≠mac, where the rate of illiteracy among women is 51.5 per cent; of Huancavelica, 47.4 per cent; of Ayacucho, 45.8 per cent; of Cajamarca, 39 per cent; of Cuzco, 36.4 per cent; of Hu√°nuco, 34.6 per cent; and of Puno, 32.9 per cent.
335. From 1981 to 1993, the illiteracy rate among women dropped by 7.8 per cent.
336. In absolute terms, the number of illiterate women has decreased by 17 thousand in the twelve years between the two censuses, which translates into a drop of 1 per cent.
It is noteworthy that the number of illiterate women in urban areas has increased by 86,000, or about 20 per cent: in 1981, 429,000 illiterate women resided in urban areas, while in 1993 they numbered 515,000.
At the same time, the number of illiterate women in rural areas diminished by 12 per cent, amounting to 103,000 in absolute terms.
On the whole, therefore, the problem of illiteracy appears to have shifted towards cities and the urban population, possibly as a result of migratory movements and the depopulation of rural areas provoked by terrorist violence.

337. Degrees of illiteracy are directly related to age in both men and women: women have always had higher illiteracy rates than men, although as the figures show, the gaps between the two in the lower age groups are shrinking.

340. Ten years later, in 1991, all these figures had gone up, with the national average illiteracy rate for girls aged 15 to 19 having declined to 2.2 per cent, although there was still an illiteracy rate of 10.5 per cent among women in this age group residing in the rural Sierra region.
In the case of young women aged 20 to 29 years, the rate of illiteracy was 7.2 per cent, and there were greater disparities in terms of place of residence: one third of the young women in the rural Sierra region could neither read nor write, while the rate of illiteracy among their contemporaries in Lima was 2.2 per cent.
341. To sum up: the breakdown of illiterates by sex shows that illiteracy remains primarily a problem among women.
If the rates of illiteracy are analysed by sex and place of residence, we see that it is a problem that affects primarily women more than men, and women in rural areas compared with those in urban zones.
Finally, illiteracy has not been completely eradicated among young women in the rural Sierra region. School attendance
342. Among children aged 6 to 11, there is a high rate of school attendance, though not a perfect one: around 87 per cent of girls and boys go to school, but there are distinctions between urban and rural areas and between boys and girls in rural areas.
343. The 1993 census recorded a rate of school attendance of 86.8 per cent for girls aged 6 to 11, in other words, 13 of every 100 girls in this age group did not attend school, with this figure rising to 20 in rural areas.
344. Illiteracy is known to originate in failure to start school at an early age and in the interruption of schooling before gaining a good command of reading and writing skills.
The increase (in 1990 and 1991) in school drop-out rates among girls at the primary school level, frequent repeating of school years during the first two years of primary school and delays in the start of schooling all form a scenario that may have negative consequences in the future.
345. Between the ages of 12 and 17, when the school attendance rate averages 74 per cent for girls and is four per cent higher for boys, the gap in attendance at educational institutions between girls in the city (78.5 per cent) and in the countryside (56.3 per cent) becomes more striking.
These figures may be assumed to reflect such diverse phenomena as the delayed start in primary school of impoverished women who go to adult education centres and the entry of women from other social groups into universities and centres of higher education.
The schooling of nearly half of all females in rural areas comes to an end in this age group.

Educational level
Average number of years of education
346. Women had an average of 6.2 years of education in 1991, but there were differences in educational coverage compared with men, half of whom had at least 7.5 years of schooling.
347. An analysis of the available data by age group and sex shows that the largest gaps in educational levels between the sexes occur among people aged 40 to 44.
This accords with the viewpoint that when the national educational service "got off the ground" in the 1950s, men benefitted first in terms of attendance at educational institutions.
In older generations, the situation had been what might be described as inequitable.
Later, in the generations born after the 1970s, there was greater equality in school attendance.
The average number of years of education for children and young people of both sexes is very similar.
348. Women aged 20 to 34 have achieved the highest levels of education compared with other age groups.
Half of them have had at least 11 years of schooling.
349. It is particularly interesting to observe the differences among women themselves according to place of residence.
The biggest disparity is between the capital city and the countryside.
Whereas half of the women residing in metropolitan Lima have had at least 11 years of study, the educational average for women in rural areas is 3.1 years, which is to say they have not completed primary school.

Breakdown by educational level
350. In the 1980s, the educational profile of women (aged 15 and above) reveals that 23 per cent (between one-fourth and one-fifth) had no schooling, and a noteworthy 40 per cent had some schooling at the primary level.
Only 8 of every 100 women went on to higher education.
In other words, professional training was not yet a widespread phenomenon for younger and older women.
351. During the period under review, women's educational levels improved, the proportion of women aged 15 and over who had no schooling or only attended primary school dropped and the percentage of women with a secondary school or higher level of education increased.
The average number of years of education rose from 5.4 in 1981 to 7.1 in 1993.
352. The most striking change is in the greater number of women in higher education: from 8 per cent in 1981, it increased to 19 per cent in 1993.

Educational level of young people
353. As the coverage of the educational system has improved, educational levels have evolved in inverse proportion to age groups, and indeed, the educational levels of girls today cannot be considered fixed.
Many of them, especially those residing in urban areas, will continue to acquire education.
354. But for the majority of women aged 20 to 24 and an even greater proportion of those aged 25 to 29, the possibilities of improving their educational levels have been virtually closed off.
They are most likely coping with the pressures of family and work rather than seeking to improve their education.
Although the problem of illiteracy has been nearly overcome, the number of women who have not gone beyond primary school remains high.

355. To sum up: In general terms, progress has clearly been made in the levels of education achieved by women in recent years.
Fifty-one per cent of women aged 15 and above have gone to secondary school or higher educational institutions, although there is still a difference between the rates for men and women in the older age groups.
Among young people the situation is different: both sexes have educational averages amounting to 10 or 11 years of study.
Options for training and professional qualification
356. The Peruvian educational system offers various methods of receiving training to enhance job prospects.
A young person may, without having completed secondary school, follow vocational training courses at the so-called Vocational Education Centres (CEO).
These provide a wide range of specialized training and operate on the basis of a fairly flexible course system in terms of duration, scheduling and curricula.
Because of the system of study and the emphasis on dressmaking, handicrafts, secretarial skills, accountancy and nursing, the CEOs have been the option of choice for women.
357. At the higher educational level, where the prerequisite is completion of secondary school, existing alternatives include the technical institutes (IST), the teacher training institutes (ISP) and the universities.
Technical training is generally completed in three years, teacher training in five, and a university education, for which an entry examination is required, lasts at least five years.
358. One characteristic feature in recent years has been the diversification of options offered within the educational system, the rationalization of a complex system that has to cope with the varying demands of different social groups and an increase in enrolment at all levels of vocational and professional training and educational options.
Women at university
359. Forty per cent of candidates for university, 39 per cent of students accepted into universities, 36 per cent of university students and 40 per cent of university graduates are now women.
Of every 10 persons who reach the university level, 6 are men and 4 are women.
Equity remains elusive but is not far off, in comparison with other indicators.
360. The number of women being educated at university has been continually growing.
A disparity in the numbers of men and women attending university education is revealed more clearly if one looks at the specific fields in which they specialize.

361. In 1990, 16 per cent of all graduates in the various specialized fields of engineering were women.
This represents an increase of five per cent compared with 1980.
362. Most women graduates have studied civil engineering or industrial, chemical or manufacturing applications.
Within the engineering branch, the number of women graduates is higher than the average in chemical engineering and manufacturing (28.6 per cent), environmental engineering (21.2 per cent), civil engineering (20.7 per cent), industrial engineering (19.7 per cent), piscicultural (18.8 per cent) and systems engineering (17.6 per cent).
In other relatively less common fields like statistical engineering, the proportion of women is greater.

In the most difficult years of the conflict - from 1982 to 1984 - the number of primary school students diminished in absolute terms in the departments of Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac and Huancavelica.
365. The exacerbation of poverty has had a lasting effect on schools.
It is estimated (on the basis of sources from the Ministry of Education) that drop-out rates at the primary and secondary school levels, which had been decreasing up until 1990 (6.2 and 7.3 per cent, respectively), rose in 1991 (11.5 and 11 per cent), the year following the adjustment (Cu√°nto 1993:143).
According to the most recent figures available from the Ministry of Education, however, the downward trend was reversed in 1993.
Drop-out rates at the primary and secondary school levels were 3.5 and 5 per cent, respectively, in 1993.
There are alarming trends in another aspect of educational quality, repeating of school years: according to the same source, the rate of repeating primary school years was 21.87, and of secondary school years, 15.68, in 1993.
366. What has characterized the evolution of Peruvian education in the past decade has been the impoverishment of public schools, the drop in teachers' salaries, the diminishment of professional qualifications among teaching staff and the resulting deterioration in the quality of education.
The effects are all the more serious in so far as they are combined with the impoverishment of families.

ARTICLE 11
368. Article 22 of the Peruvian Constitution states that employment is a right and a duty.
It is the basis for social well-being and an instrument of personal accomplishment.
Article 23 of the Constitution reads as follows: "Employment, in its various aspects, shall be given priority attention by the State, which shall provide special protection for working mothers, minors and disabled persons.
The State shall promote social and economic progress, in particular through policies to designed to foster productive employment and vocational training.
The exercise of constitutional rights may not be restricted, nor the dignity of the worker disregarded or demeaned, by any employment relationship.
No one shall be obliged to work without remuneration or without free consent."
369. Article 24 of the same instrument states the following about remuneration: "The worker shall have the right to equitable and appropriate remuneration such as to ensure his or her material and spiritual well-being and that of his or her family.
Payment of remuneration and social benefits to the worker shall take priority over all the employer's other obligations.
Minimum wages shall be set by the State with the participation of organizations representing workers and employers".
Article 26 of the Political Charter stipulates that one of the principles to be respected in labour relations is that of equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination.
Article 27 of the Charter provides that the law shall accord the worker adequate protection against arbitrary dismissal.
370. Finally, article 59 of the Charter guarantees freedom of employment, providing it is not damaging to public morals, health or security, and offers ways of overcoming inequity in any sectors experiencing such treatment.
371. It will be clear from the above that no distinction is made between men and women.
As far as legislation is concerned, in addition to the Constitution we may refer to article 4 of the Convention and provide information about legislation on remuneration, social security, maternity and special protection measures.
EMPLOYMENT
372. In an economic context that is highly unfavourable to both men and women, the principal changes in the employment of women in Peru over the past decade have been: a) a higher rate of activity, reflected in a sharp growth in the number of women in the economically active population (EAP); b) a trend towards levelling off of the occupational structure for women compared with men, particularly in some employment sectors; and c) increased inequity in the distribution of income among working women as a function of their different employment sectors.
373. The higher proportion of economically active women seems to be associated with an increase in their educational levels.
Those who have acquired professional qualifications have enhanced their opportunities to leave domestic service behind and enter the job market.
This is visible in the educational profile of women in the EAP, one-third of whom have acceded to higher education.
The disparity between the numbers of women and men in the EAP is noteworthy here.
374. The trend towards a relative improvement in the situation of women with respect to employment in Peru originates in the growing presence of women within the labour force.
Nevertheless, improvements in women's employment have been affected by the Peruvian economy and the crisis that began in the mid-1970s.
Rate of economic activity
375. In 1993, 2,104,775 women were part of the economically active population (EAP), a figure that yields an economic activity rate of 29.7 per cent for women aged 15 and above.
376. The economically active population was predominantly male, men representing 70.4 per cent of the EAP, but women nevertheless accounted for nearly one-third.
In the interim between censuses, 1981-1993, the proportion of women in the EAP rose from 25 per cent to 29.5 per cent.
With the female EAP growing at an average annual rate of 5.4 per cent and the incorporation of 826,000 women in the economy, a feminization of the economically active population took place from 1981 to 1993.
377. The economic activity rates for women vary according to their age, with young women being extensively employed in the economic sector (30 per cent), the highest rate being among women aged 30 to 44 (36.4 per cent) and older women tending to have lower economic activity rates.
378. Observation of the fluctuations in economic activity rates according to age group reveals that women aged 30 to 44, the majority of them married, increased their presence in the EAP by 7.2 per cent from 1981 to 1993, followed by women aged 15 to 29 with an increase of 4.3 per cent.
Among women aged 45 and older, a slight increase is noticeable.
This performance contrasts with that of men, for whom the economic activity rates in all age groups are decreasing, with the largest reduction in those for men aged 45 and older.

Activity branches 379. Working women are primarily employed in the terciary sector: 67 per cent of economically active women are employed in this sector, called commerce and services (see table 57).
380. From 1981 to 1991, the proportion of women in this economic branch grew from 57.1 to 67 per cent, owing to the fact that women have mainly become involved in independent economic activity.

Underemployment
381. In view of the poverty prevailing in Peru, it is more appropriate to measure underemployment by income rather than by time on the job (length of the working day).
382. Nearly the entire labour force can be described as being underpaid.
This is the case, in the EAP of metropolitan Lima, of around 78.2 per cent of women, and 76.7 per cent of men.
383. From 1981 to 1993, the number of people underpaid rose by 48 per cent for women and by 59 per cent for men.
This brings the proportion of men and women underpaid nearly to parity, but the impact of underpayment has been heaviest among women, since 55.2 per cent of the economically active women in metropolitan Lima have been affected.
384. The proportion of women who are severely or moderately underpaid increased by a factor of 10.5 from 1981 to 1993, whereas the proportion of women adequately paid or slightly underpaid rose by a factor of 8.5.
In other words, women tended to be concentrated in the lowest income groups, or to put it another way, the gap in the distribution of income among women expanded.
385. At the other end of the income scale, the number of women who are adequately paid (9.2 per cent in 1993) - that is, whose earnings are above the average - has been sharply reduced: in 1981, half of all women were adequately paid.
386. This proportion is tending to level off in comparison with men.
The gap between men and women in terms of adequate payment declined from -20.8 per cent in 1981 to -5.1 per cent in 1993.
In this sense, the drop in income affects men more than women, in that there is a group of women that has experienced relatively smaller reductions in their remunerations.
URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT
387. In 1993, the unemployment rate for women in urban areas was 8.2 per cent.
When the data are broken down by sex, the unemployment rates for men and women appear to be virtually identical to the national urban average, but in metropolitan Lima, the gap between men and women is greatly to the disadvantage of women.

388. The changes recorded in the intercensal interim indicate that whereas the urban unemployment rate for women declined slightly, from 9.9 per cent in 1981 to 8.2 per cent in 1993, the rate for men rose from 5.3 per cent in 1981 to 8.6 per cent in 1993.
In terms of urban unemployment, the impact of the economic crisis and structural adjustment has apparently been harsher for men than for women.
It should be noted that since women often enter the workforce as independent workers or by doing unpaid family work, rather than by becoming workers or employees, they are not counted as unemployed workers, since they are not seeking a salaried position.
389. Unemployment rates have not levelled off in metropolitan Lima to the same extent as in the country as a whole, the figures for which were 5 and 11 per cent for men and women, respectively, in 1981, and 8.3 and 12.2 per cent, respectively, in 1993.
ARTICLE 12
HEALTH
390. Progress has indisputably been made with respect to the health of women in terms of fertility and awareness and use of contraceptives and in some indicators of maternal and child health.
Nevertheless, significant gaps can be observed among women on the basis of their social status.
It is noteworthy that in their knowledge of means of contraception and in achieving their desired level of fertility, women of all social groups are fairly similar, but that in their ability to realize their aspirations, there are differences.
LIFE EXPECTANCY
391. Life expectancy for Peruvian women was 66.6 years, and for men, 62.7 years, from 1990 to 1995.
There are more striking differences within the female population than between men and women: life expectancy for women in urban areas was 7 years longer than for women in rural areas.
Between 1975-1980 and 1990-1995, life expectancy for women increased by 7.8 years, and the gap between urban and rural areas remained virtually the same.
PERU 1975-1980/1990-1995
LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH, BY SEX
392. This trend towards an increase in life expectancy at birth has consolidated the elderly group among the population, which currently includes 5 per cent of all Peruvian women, who require the creation of specialized policies and services.
MATERNAL MORTALITY
393. Peru is estimated to have had a maternal mortality rate of 261 per 100,000 live births in 1993, representing a drop of 19 per cent compared with 1981, when there were 321 deaths per 100,000 live births.
Women without formal education had the highest rates of maternal mortality: 489 per 100,000 live births, ten times the rate for women with higher education (49) and higher than the national average of ten years ago.
394. The principal causes of maternal mortality are interruption of unwanted pregnancies and childbirth without adequate clinical care (haemorrage, infection and hypertension).
According to certain studies carried out in marginalized areas of Lima, septic abortion was the primary cause of maternal mortality in 1986 and 1988 (Ministry of Health, 1986 and 1988).
According to another nationwide study done in 1985, abortion was the second most frequent cause of maternal mortality (22 per cent).
In 1989, 43 abortions were performed for every 100 live births, or 271,000 abortions in the year.
The abortion rate among Peruvian women aged 15 to 49 was 5.2 per cent (The Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1994). MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES
INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY
395. From 1981 to 1991, the average rate of infant mortality rose to 64 per 1,000 and of child mortality, 92 per 1,000.
Male infant mortality was 15 per cent higher than that of females, while male child mortality was 8 per cent higher.
396. Infant mortality dropped by 14 per cent, and child mortality, by 28 per cent, compared with 1977-1981, this downward trend being chiefly linked to an increase in the educational levels of mothers.
397. From 1981 to 1991, infant and child mortality rates in rural areas, particularly in the departments where poverty is concentrated, remained high.
Infant mortality was 90 per 1,000, and child mortality, 131 per 1,000.

CAUSES OF INFANT AND CHILD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY
398. In 1990 and 1991, the principal causes of infant and child mortality, both male and female, were preventable and treatable.
They included: a) conditions that originated during the perinatal period; b) acute respiratory infections (ARI); c) acute diarrhoeal diseases (ADD); and d) nutritional deficiencies.
Inadequate prevention, lack of basic sanitary facilities and a deterioration in diet caused these factors to have a sharper impact from 1986 to 1991. PERU 1990-1991
FERTILITY
399. In the early 1990s, the total fertility rate nationwide was 3.5 children per woman, a reduction of 34 per cent compared with 1977, when it was 5.3 children per woman.
There are subgroups of the population, however, such as women without formal education and women residing in rural areas, who have significantly higher rates of fertility (7.1 and 6.2 per cent, respectively), which could point to a correlation between high rates of fertility and high levels of poverty.

CONTRACEPTION
400. Most women are aware of the existence of contraceptives.
Among married women, 95 per cent know about or have at least heard of them, and 89 per cent know where to procure them.
401. Fifty-nine per cent of married women of fertile age (15 to 44) use some type of contraceptive.
Most of them (56 per cent) rely on modern methods, while the remainder (44 per cent) choose traditional methods.
402. The level of contraceptive use is directly linked to women's levels of education and urbanization.
The use of contraceptives is most common among women with a higher education or those residing in metropolitan Lima, while it is women without formal education or those in rural areas who are recorded as using contraceptives with the least frequency.
403. Similarly, the use of modern techniques such as the pill, IUD, foam and condoms is most common among women in urban areas and those with higher educational levels.
Sixty per cent of women in urban areas use modern techniques, whereas only 38 per cent of women in rural areas does so.
Sixty-five per cent of women with a higher education uses modern techniques, which are employed by only 32 per cent of women without formal education.
404. Analysis of changes over the past decade shows that, for women from all social strata, knowledge and use of contraceptives has increased.
Even though the number of women from rural areas and of women without formal education who use contraceptives has doubled, the prevalence of contraceptive use within these sectors has remained below the national average, and even where the use of modern methods has increased, over 60 per cent of these women uses traditional methods.
405. In 1991, as in the previous decade, the rhythm method or periodic abstinence (traditional method) was the one used most often by married women (21 per cent).
The IUD was the modern method most frequently used by married women (13 per cent), followed by sterilization (8 per cent), the use of the first method having tripled, and of the second, doubled, in comparison with 1981.
FERTILITY PREFERENCES
406. In 1991, the ideal number of children for all women of fertile age (15 to 49) was an average of 2.5: this figure does not differ greatly from that of 1981, which was 2.9.
The disparity between women living in Lima and those in rural areas is smaller today than it was ten years ago.
Women in rural areas want to have fewer children than in the past, and their preferences are fairly similar to those of women in cities.
This indicates that there is an alarming number of unwanted children, around 56 per cent of births from 1987 to 1991.
This figure is not far off from the 60 per cent recorded in 1982-1986.
408. Despite widespread awareness of contraceptive techniques, an appropriate correlation between the number of children desired and the number of children born to women has not been achieved.
A large number of women have more children than they consider to be ideal: this is the case for 46 per cent of women with four children, 41 per cent of those with five and 29 per cent of those with six.
All of them believe the ideal number to be two.
This phenomenon is influenced by the large number of early marriages, primarily in the jungle regions (Loreto, Ucayali) and in the Sierra (A.A. C√°ceres, J.C. Mari√°tegui, Inca) and in marginal urban areas of the major cities, something which affects the health and personal development of adolescents and young women.
ANAEMIA IN WOMEN AND PREGNANT WOMEN
409. There is no information to enable us to determine the prevalence of anaemia on the basis of haemoglobin levels of pregnant and non-pregnant women.
410. A study carried out in metropolitan Lima in 1991 (IIN, 1992) indicates that 55 per cent of pregnant women were anaemic.
In 1984, a figure of 53 per cent had been recorded, relatively close to the percentage for 1991, in a youth camp of metropolitan Lima and a hospital (Loayza) for patients from low-income groups.
411. Except in the first year of life, avitaminosis is one of the causes of mortality that affects primarily women - 53.1 per cent, compared with 46.9 per cent for men nationwide.
When we break down this figure by region, we see that the situation is worse in the north, where the difference between the sexes is 12.9 per cent greater.
412. To study maternal undernutrition, one must first go back to infancy, when both boys and girls frequently show signs of chronic undernutrition: 36.5 per cent nationwide, 53.7 per cent in the Inca region and 50.6 per cent in the Libertadores Wari region.
413. According to the demographic and family health survey (ENDES) 1991-1992, 17 per cent of pregnant women nationwide are undernourished, this figure increasing to 21.7 in the case of women aged 15 to 19, to 23 per cent for women in rural areas and to 30 per cent among women with no formal education.
INFANT UNDERNUTRITION
414. The results of the survey on size and weight carried out in December 1993 by the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the Ministry of Health on a representative group of schoolchildren aged 6 to 9 show that 48 per cent suffers from chronic undernutrition.
Thirty-eight per cent of the children live in urban areas and 62 per cent in rural regions, 46 per cent are girls, and 64 per cent, boys.
415. In 1991, acute undernutrition resulting from weight loss affected 1.4 per cent of all children aged 5, the incidence being slightly lower among girls than boys. PERU 1984-1991

IMMUNIZATION
416. In 1991, 57.7 per cent of all children aged 12 to 23 months were receiving all the vaccines, namely BCG, three doses of vaccine against poliomyelitis and DPT vaccine.
No form of immunization was given to 4.1 per cent.
Protection of girls was slightly higher than of boys (58.7 per cent compared with 56.8 per cent).
417. Immunization coverage has increased in comparison with previous years, this expansion having been made possible partly by the immunization days held since the mid-1980s.

PROTECTION AGAINST TETANUS TOXOID
418. Of the mothers whose children were born from 1987 to 1991, 20.1 per cent received two or more doses of antitetanus vaccine and are thus completely covered against this disease.
419. Lower figures were recorded for women without formal education (11.5 per cent) and for those living in the Sierra region (12.3 per cent) and in rural areas (14.4 per cent), who are precisely those women with less access to professional care at the time of childbirth.
420. From 1982 to 1986, coverage increased, although the number of women fully immunized cannot be determined, since the number of doses was not recorded in 1986.
CHILDBIRTH ATTENDANTS 421. In Peru, professionals are present for only half of all births (53 per cent) (physicians, obstetricians and nurses), 29 per cent of births being the responsibility of midwives, and the remaining 18 per cent taking place under the care of family members and other non-specialists.
422. Professional aid for childbirth is even less frequent among women without formal education and women in rural areas, where barely 18 per cent of all births occur in the presence of a physician, obstetrician or nurse.
423. There has been a slight increase compared with 1982-1986 in the number of births with professionals in attendance, from 49 per cent to 53 per cent.
The number of births with midwives in attendance also increased slightly during this period in some sectors.

WOMEN AND AIDS
424. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has established itself in Peruvian territory and is undergoing rapid growth and maturation in increasingly broad sectors of the population: the number of HIV-infected persons reported in 1992-1993 is higher than the total number for the previous nine years (1983-1991).
No less than 60 per cent of recent cases of sexual transmission of HIV occurred between people who are exclusively heterosexual.
A growing trend towards infection of women and children has been observed.
HIV infection is occurring at an increasingly early age.
Other sexually transmitted diseases, of which there is a high incidence, remain without adequate treatment.
Active tuberculosis is detected in no less than 25 per cent of AIDS sufferers at the time the disease is diagnosed.
Demand for care for persons affected by HIV/AIDS is growing, and the response is unsatisfactory, as is the relevant legal regime.
At the start of the pandemic, 20 cases of AIDS were recorded in men for each case in women, but today, 4 cases in men are recorded for each case in women.
425. The heterosexualization of HIV/AIDS propagation in Peru is also reflected in a slow but steady trend towards perinatal transmission.
The increase in HIV/AIDS cases among women highlights the special social, biological and epidemiological vulnerability of women: most Peruvian women infected with HIV/AIDS were monogamous.
426. HIV/AIDS occurs in Peru primarily in Lima (31.5 per cent), Arequipa, Inca and La Libertad (9 per cent and 10 per cent) and Grau, Mara√±√≥n and Wari (7 per cent and 8 per cent); other regions have 5 per cent and less of the total number of HIV/AIDS cases.
427. In 1993, 11.4 per cent of the total number of AIDS cases recorded were women.
The number of women infected grew steadily from 1983 to 1993.
The principal means of AIDS transmission to women is sexual (75 per cent of all cases recorded).
AIDS cases occur in girls aged less than five chiefly as a result of perinatal transmission and transmission through the bloodstream.
Women's risk of HIV infection through the parents is three times higher than that of men.

MENTAL HEALTH
428. The parameters for judging mental health are not absence of psychiatric disease alone; they also include self-esteem, capacity to live a productive life in harmony with the social environment, to participate democratically in decision-making, to establish lasting personal relations, to work and compete on equal terms, to retain a sense of humour, to cope with the changes that come with aging and the events of daily life without feeling overwhelmed and to look to the future.
These indicators have not yet been fully developed and are primarily qualitative rather than quantitative (Garc√≠a Trovato 1993).
429. The situation of women in Peru retains certain elements of inequity and discrimination which affect the quality of their lives and which can be transformed into risk factors for their mental health.
430. Most girls in Peru begin to participate very early in life in domestic tasks and are taught from a very young age to serve others.
They do not learn to refuse to do things they do not want to do, and they are even subjected to physical aggression and sexual abuse, generally within their own families, with serious consequences for their self-esteem and the development of their personalities.
431. In adolescence, one of the most weighty problems for girls is disinformation about their physiological development: they lack basic information about the onset of menstruation and the numerous physical and psychological changes they are to undergo.
Anxiety and depression, adaptative difficulties and personality disorders are common.
Adolescents are the most vulnerable group for the consumption of psychotropic substances; women tend to consume legalized drugs such as tobacco and alcohol and their consumption of tranquilizers is higher than that of men.
432. Women carry out numerous tasks both in the domestic arena and in productive sectors.
Some women also work at the grass-roots level in communal efforts.
This overload creates anxiety and psychosomatic disturbances.
433. Features linked to women's physiology such as pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium create a series of risk factors for physical and mental health that are not often taken into account.
434. During menopause, in addition to the symptoms and signals derived from hormonal deprivation, depression, anxiety, irritability and sleep disturbances are also common, as are symptoms of hypochondria.
Family members are given very little preparation for and understanding of this period.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
435. Major studies of occupational health do not generally include women - hence the lack of detailed information on the problems faced by women in the workplace.
436. Poverty, limited access to health services and the long and unpredictable working hours in the informal sector mitigate against preservation of the health of working women.
They are exposed to higher risks owing to the nutritional deficiencies, fatigue and tension resulting from lack of support or of resources and from their vulnerability to various types of harassment or abuse.
In general, health services have been concentrated in the area of maternal and child health.
437. The jobs done by women generally require speed, visual and mental concentration and manual dexterity, and immobility and long working hours are common.
Women who do ambulatory marketing, fish packaging and municipal cleaning spend long days on their feet, in bad weather and in highly polluted areas.
Health risks in jobs predominantly done by women are:
- Independent workers and women who do unpaid family work represent 40.3 per cent and 25.5 per cent, respectively, of the female EAP.
This includes women who engage in informal trade and production.
Risk factors: lack of protection by labour legislation such as regulations on working hours, wages, social security and occupational health standards.
It is becoming necessary in Peru to gain a better understanding of the lives of women engaged in informal trade and production.
With the increasing industrialization of intensive capital as part of development, marginalized or displaced persons are subsisting by doing piece work, working on commission or selling items provided by wholesale dealers.
- Rural workers: women make up 50 per cent of the EAP in rural areas.
Risk factors: long working days, seasonal work, low salaries, inadequate transport, exposure to microorganisms, exposure to insecticides, noise, exposure to variable climatic conditions, non-ionizing radiation and vibrations, transport of heavy burdens, animal bites and insect stings.
These factors tend to result in infertility, spontaneous abortion and bleeding.
The use of insecticides in particular does not take account of effects on women's reproductive health.
- Office staff: such employees represent 13 per cent of the female EAP.
Risk factors: the need for speed, uncomfortable working conditions, weak lighting, climatic problems, toxic substances, electromagnetic radiation, repetitive and boring work and sexual harassment.
- Industrial workers, particularly in the textile industry, represent 7.4 per cent of the female EAP.
Risk factors: noise, vibrations, defective machinery, uncomfortable positions, rapid pace, cotton and synthetic fibre particles and harmful chemical substances.
- Domestic workers represent 11.2 per cent of the female EAP in metropolitan Lima.
Risk factors: low wages, minimal acknowledgement, 15-day vacations, lack of time for personal matters.
438. Women account for more than 50 per cent of staff in the medical field and do their work under precarious conditions and for slim recompense.
The highest risks are associated with the laboratory handling of dangerous organic and chemical substances.
Nurses are exposed to communicable diseases and toxic substances, in addition to the tension created by work overloads and by their responsibilities for the care of their patients.
HEALTH SERVICES AND CONDITIONS
State spending on health
439. In 1991, spending on health represented only 0.31 per cent of the GDP; in 1980, it was 1.12 per cent.
These budgetary restrictions affect the development of various health care programmes and the appropriate equipment of public health facilities.
440. In 1991, the current Government set up the National Fund for Compensation and Social Development (FONCODES) as one of the principal programmes for the alleviation of extreme poverty.
In 1992, this body devoted 7 per cent of its funds (12.2 million new soles) to health care programmes.
Sanitation 441. Although drinking water coverage has expanded, rural areas continue to experience major shortages of water supply and drainage services.
The poor sanitation conditions in Peru have facilitated the propagation of epidemics, such as that of cholera, which had been thought to have been eradicated and which infected 506,000 people from 1991 to mid-1992.

Health care coverage and services
442. In 1990 there were 3,328 health posts, meaning one for every 6,000 inhabitants, and 777 health care centres, or one for every 27,000 inhabitants.
The number of health centres and posts had virtually doubled compared with the early 1980s.
443. In 1993, obstetrical beds numbered 3,677, meaning they were available for 46 per cent of all women in childbirth.
This is an increase of barely 1.4 per cent since 1985.
In the Sierra region and the jungle, the figures are even lower.

National Censuses 1986 & 1993.
444. In 1990, human resources in the health sector (public and private) comprised 23,000 physicians, 18,000 nurses and 4,000 obstetricians.
Seventy-three per cent of all physicians and 55 per cent of nurses were located in metropolitan Lima, where there is one physician for every 440 inhabitants, whereas in the rest of the country, the ratio is one physician for every 2,500 inhabitants (CUANTO and UNICEF, 1992).
Participation of Women in Health Care Management
445. From 1980 to 1990, women participated actively in defending the health of their families through various women's grass-roots organizations: health committees, the "glass of milk" programme and the people's canteens.
They were heavily involved in activities promoted or supported by NGOs, the Ministry of Health, municipalities or their own communities.
The role of women's organizations in the immunization campaigns, the fight against the cholera epidemic and against communicable diseases was considerable.
446. They likewise participated in the management of health projects supported by FONCODES.
447. Women's involvement in health management activities takes place basically on a voluntary basis and generally has an adverse effect on their own health by extending the length of their working days.
Article 13
448. Commercial banking records do not take the gender factor into account.
The State Bank for Development and nearly all the mutual and cooperative savings and loan institutions are currently being liquidated.
Consequently, it has not been possible to obtain gender-disaggregated information on bank loans.
449. This, together with the fact that women are primarily employed in the informal sector of the economy and with the reluctance of banks to grant loans to workers in this sector (both men and women) leads us to consider alternative forms of access to credit for workers in the informal sector.
Women's economic activity and access to credit
450. The entrepreneurial activities carried out by women are basically trade-oriented. Women are much less involved in the production sectors.
451. The branches of industrial production in which women are most frequently employed centre on those in which they have greater competitive advantage than men.
In reality, their work remains linked to their customary occupations and traditional roles, such as dressmaking and knitted goods, whereas their involvement in "men's" activities such as carpentry and footwear remains limited.
452. Microenterprises, which are strongly implicated in the development of the informal sector of the economy, are basically dependent upon informal forms of financing and the credit programmes of a great many NGOs.
Since the late 1980s, these organizations have been the conduit for funds from international technical cooperation and from the State.
They work with financial institutions through revolving funds, guarantee funds or lines of credit provided by the system to NGOs to administer.
The credit programmes being carried out by the NGOs focus on urban and marginalized areas and are directed at the financing of production and trade.
453. The extent of women's participation in credit programmes for people of both sexes basically depends on the type of economic activity and microenterprise for which the credits are intended.
More credits are accorded to women when the overall composition of the portfolio emphasizes the commercial sector and investment is clearly oriented towards income-generating activities or those that are not unduly capital-intensive.
454. Statistics on the activities of small enterprises and microenterprises tend to underestimate the role of women as entrepreneurs, mainly because it tends to be assumed that family businesses are run by the head of the household.
455. The limitations on access to financial credit for women who head microenterprises or small enterprises are the same as those for men.
Discrimination is more likely to occur in respect of the type of economic activity undertaken, the extent to which it is part of the formal economy, the type of financing required and the meeting of requirements for guarantees.
456. Although there is no discrimination against women in respect of credit, no effort is made to establish different objectives geared for potential female recipients.
This can be seen in the activities and standardized training courses on credit authorization carried out by NGOs: they do not take into account such factors as sex, educational level and the effect on availability of schedules and working hours.
Agricultural sector Credits
After this bank was dissolved, two means of acquiring credits were created: the Rural Funds (private enterprise for financial mediation for farmers) and the Agricultural Development Funds (Fondeagros) administered by regional governments.
Land ownership
458. The Special Project for Rural Land Titling and Property Registration (PETT), established under the eighth provision of the Ministry of Agriculture Organization Act, has the purpose of encouraging and supporting rural land owners without discrimination as to sex with a view to the rationalization and regularization of land ownership over a period of four years.
The following trends may be observed on the basis of information on property and holdings in a coastal province:
PROPERTY BY SIZE OF HOLDINGS AND SEX OF OWNER, PROVINCE OF MORROPON IN PIURNAS, 1993
2 to 4.99 ha. 33 16.6 10.3 288 27.1 89.7 321 25.5 100.0
Source: Special Project for Rural Land Titling and Property Registration (PETT), Ministry of Agriculture.
Elaborated by team responsible for National Report on Rural Women.
a. Percentage of land owned by women: 14.1% of the province's farmland.
b. Only 15.8% of all owners are women.
c. Size of holdings: 75.4% of the owners have less than 2 ha., 16.6% have 2 to 4 ha.
459. The amount of land owned by women is small.
The dimensions of the land owned by women are limited, and therefore, even where irrigation exists, the output can hardly generate the income required by a family.
460. Administrative difficulties in the registration of property nationwide and lack of access to the information in existing records make it impossible to assess the access of women to land ownership in rural and urban areas.
Article 14
WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS
461. One third of the total female population resides in rural areas situated primarily in the Sierra region and the jungle.
It is in these regions that the social and economic disadvantages are the greatest, that the chronic problems of cultural, social and political isolation are most powerfully manifested.
In 1993, 20 per cent of the entire female population designated as its mother tongue either Quechua, Aymara or another indigenous language, but in rural areas, the proportion of women whose mother tongue was not Spanish was as high as 41 per cent.
Poverty and ethnic and cultural disparities are not confined to rural areas, however.
Urban centres and even Lima also attest to the breadth and diversity of the cultural universe.
462. The age structure varies according to place of residence, with a greater concentration of infants in rural areas than urban ones.
Whereas infants represent 33 per cent of the population in urban areas, in rural areas 44 per cent of the women are girls.
Young women and adult women have congregated in urban centres, possibly in search of better working and educational opportunities for themselves and their families.
The growth potential inherent in the age structure explains why, despite a reduction in fertility in Peru, 600,000 people are born every year.
This situation will be reversed only after the year 2000, when the majority of the population will be over 15 years of age.
463. Another relevant indicator is that of maternity.
According to the most recent census (1993), 4,835,972 women over 15 years of age were mothers, a figure representing 68.3 per cent of the population.
Sixty-six per cent of women in these age groups in urban areas, and 76 per cent in rural locations, were mothers. RURAL AGRARIAN ORGANIZATIONS
464. Owing to the violence that has swept over the country, in rural areas, particularly in the emergency zones, women have taken on positions of authority in their communities as a result of the massive migration, disappearances and deaths of their spouses and sons.
In addition, organized into peasant's patrols, they have actively participated in the defence of their communities (Amelia Fort 1993).
465. The representation of rural women in certain rural decision-making or lobbying structures such as the Rural Women's Confederation (CCP), the National Agrarian Confederation (CNA) and the ONA is still weak, being limited to the position of secretary for women's affairs, a body set up in 1988 at the "first rural women's meeting".
RURAL WOMEN'S CONFEDERATION (CCP)
466. Only limited and uncorrelated information is available on organizations for rural women.
In 1982, district associations of rural women were set up in both the Quechua- and the Aymara-speaking zones.
Subsequently this form of organization spread to other departments such as Jun√≠n and Piura.
In 1988 the first National Assembly of Rural Women was held and was attended by about 50 women from all over the country.
467. Their demands included better market prices for their products and recognition of their production role.
They also called for access to land and credit and the right to establish and manage their own organizations and to produce radio programmes.
THE NATIONAL AGRARIAN CONFEDERATION (CNA) AND THE ROLE OF RURAL WOMEN
468. Women have succeeded in joining the administrative body of this trade union association.
Various national meetings have gradually improved the situation of women.
Since 1989 and the fifth national congress of the CNA, women have been represented on the governing board.
From 1990 to 1993 they constituted 22.7 per cent of the members of this body.
The concentration of women diminishes in exact correlation with the level of power, however: the lower the level, the higher the concentration.
469. With regard to family planning, we have the following information on:
470. In the early 1990s, the total fertility rate nationwide was 3.5 children per woman, a reduction of 34 per cent compared with 1977, when it was 5.3.
471. In 1991, the ideal number of children for all women of fertile age (15 to 49) was an average of 2.5: this figure does not differ greatly from that of 1981, which was 2.9.
472. The disparity between women living in Lima and those in rural areas is smaller today than it was ten years ago.
Women in rural areas want to have fewer children than in the past, and their preferences are fairly similar to those of women in cities.
The situation of women in the agricultural sector in relation to credit acquisition has been discussed in connection with article 13 of the Convention.
ARTICLE 15
EQUALITY OF WOMEN WITH MEN
473. The equality of women with men before the law has been recognized in Peru.
In Peru's Constitution, article 1, we find that the defence of the individual and respect for human dignity constitute the supreme purpose of society; article 2, paragraph 2 speaks of the right of all persons to equality before the law.
EQUALITY OF CIVIL RIGHTS
474. This principle is set out in article 4 of the Civil Code, which states that men and women have equal capacity to enjoy and to exercise civil rights.
Consequently, any act that tends to discriminate against women solely on the basis of their sex, in any activity they may undertake, is considered null and void.
Freedom of movement and of choice of residence
475. Article 2, paragraph 11 of the Peruvian Constitution stipulates that everyone has the right to choose his or her place of residence, to move through the national territory and to enter and leave it, excepting where limited by reasons of health, judicial mandate or application of legislation on aliens.
476. With regard to relations among spouses, article 290 of the Civil Code states that both spouses have the right and the duty to participate in management of the household and to cooperate to ensure the best possible functioning thereof.
Concerning conjugal domicile, it indicates that both spouses are competent to fix and transfer the conjugal domicile and to decide matters relating to household economy.
ARTICLE 16
WOMEN AS HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD
477. As mentioned earlier, in 1993 just over 1,100,000 households, or 23.3 per cent of all households in Peru, were headed by women who, in that capacity, supported their children and other dependents.
Assuming an average of five persons per household, the number of people in households headed by women would be 5,500,000.
This figure is to some extent underestimated, since the mere presence of a man suffices for researchers carrying out a census and for residents of the household themselves to consider that he is the head of the household.
The pattern is that the greater the poverty level, the greater the likelihood that a household will be headed by a woman.
From 1981 to 1993, a major increase of households headed by women was recorded.
Family legislation
478. The Civil Code regulates personal relations between spouses in terms of the rights and duties deriving from matrimony, the property regime, the relaxation and dissolution of the bond and the parental-filial union.
Personal relations between spouses
479. In this connection, the Civil Code states that in the act of marriage, the spouses jointly assume the responsibility for supporting and educating their children (article 287).
480. It also states that both spouses have the right and the duty to participate in the management of the household and to cooperate in ensuring the best possible functioning thereof.
Both are competent to fix and transfer the conjugal domicile and to decide matters relating to the household economy (article 287).
482. The spouses are jointly responsible for the legal representation of the conjugal union.
Either spouse may authorize the other to assume total or partial responsibility for such representation.
483. The conjugal union may be represented by either of the spouses, interchangeably, in respect of the everyday needs of the household and acts of administration and preservation (Article 292 CC).
484. Each of the spouses may, with the express or tacit consent of the other spouse, exercise any profession and work outside the home (Article 292 CC).
Property regime
485. In respect of property regime, article 300 of the Civil Code provides that irrespective of the regime being used, both spouses are obliged to contribute to the maintenance of the household according to their respective abilities and income.
Where necessary, a judge shall determine the contribution to be made by each.
486. Each spouse retains the right to administer his or her personal property and to dispose of or encumber it (Article 303 CC).
487. If one of the spouses fails to contribute earnings on his or her personal property to the maintenance of the household, the other spouse may request that such earnings, in full or in part, be placed under his or her management (Article 305 CC).
488. Both spouses are responsible for the administration of joint property.
Either of the spouses may authorize the other to assume total or partial responsibility for such administration (Article 313 CC).
489. In order to dispose of or encumber joint property, the involvement of both husband and wife is indispensable, but this is not required for such acquisitions of immovable property as may be carried out by one of the spouses individually (Article 315 CC).
Dissolution of the bond of marriage
490. The Code also regulates divorces, which dissolves the bond of marriage based on a series of procedural grounds outlined in the law (Article 348 CC).
Paternal-filial union (parental authority)
491. Parental authority is exercised jointly by the parents.
Any disageements are to be resolved by the children's and adolescents' judge (Article 419 CC).
Alimentary pensions 492. Alimentary pensions are payable reciprocally:
1. By spouses;
2. By progenitors and descendants;
Adoption 493. In the event of adoption, guardianship or curatorship (covered and regulated by our legislation), men and women have equal rights and responsibilities, with the interests of the children being paramount.
In this connection, article VIII of the Code of Children and Adolescents states: "For any steps relating to children and adolescents taken by the State through the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Branches, the Public Prosecutor, regional governments, local governments and other government institutions, as well as for steps taken by society, the best interests of the child or adolescent and respect for their rights shall be taken into account".
Right to a name
494. The Civil Code regulates matters relating to the right of children of married couples to a name, stipulating that the first surname shall be that of the father and the second, that of the mother.
495. For children born out of wedlock, article 21 states that the surname of the progenitor who has recognized them shall be given.
If a child is recognized by both progenitors, it bears the name of both.
The same regulation applies in the event of filiation by judicial declaration.
496. The Civil Code also regulates matters relating to the right of a woman to append her husband's surname to her own and to continue to use it until she remarries.
It indicates that this right ceases to apply in the event of divorce or nullification of the marriage.
In the event of separation, a woman retains her right to use her husband's surname (article 24).
Rights of women in cohabitation, including their rights upon the death of a companion
497. These are covered by the nation's substantive regulations (Civil Code), article 326 of which provides that "A de facto union voluntarily entered into and maintained between a man and a woman free of matrimonial ties in order to accomplish purposes and fulfil duties similar to those of matrimony shall create a society of property subject to the joint acquisitions regime, where applicable, whenever such union has lasted for at least two successive years".
Should the de facto union be terminated by unilateral decision, a judge may, at the request of the abandoned spouse, establish a sum of money in the form of indemnification or alimentary pension.
Article 826 of the Civil Code further provides that if a person dies within 30 days of the marriage ceremony, there shall be no succession in respect of the widow or widower, unless the ceremony was to regularize a de facto union.
PERPETUATION OF THE PRACTICE OF BETROTHAL
498. Betrothal is the mutual commitment to matrimony of persons of different sexes.
Article 240 of the Civil Code in force indicates that should the commitment be broken through the fault of a betrothed person, thereby causing damage to the other betrothed person or to a third party, the first betrothed person is obliged to pay compensation.
MINIMUM AGE FOR CONTRACTING MARRIAGE
499. In this connection, article 46 of the Civil Code states that the incapacity of a person over 16 years of age ceases upon marriage or the acquisition of an official document authorizing such person to exercise a profession or office.
Incapacity also ceases upon marriage for women over 14 years of age.
The legal capacity acquired through marriage does not end with the dissolution of the marriage.
WOMEN'S RIGHT TO REMARRY
500. In this respect, article 433 of the Civil Code indicates that the father or mother of any person wishing to remarry must, before such marriage occurs, request a judge to convene a family council for the purpose of deciding whether the family should continue to administer the property of children of a previous marriage.
Should the decision be in the affirmative, the new spouses are to be jointly responsible.
Should the decision be in the negative, or should the father or mother decline to administer the children's property, the family council appoints a curator.
Similarly, article 434 of the Civil Code indicates that the parents of children born out of wedlock remain subject to the provisions of article 433.
V.95-60370T CONSIDERATION OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PLANS
National drug control plans: progress and prospects
Report of the Executive Director
In promoting the master-plan concept, UNDCP stresses the national character of such plans and fosters country ownership by encouraging participation of all national entities with a stake in drug control and by strengthening coordination between institutions involved in drug control.
UNDCP cooperation ranges from the provision of specialized advice to full-fledged technical assistance.
The master-plan approach has proven useful in defining common strategies and goals, in promoting a common understanding of the drug issue, and in fostering cooperation at the national and international levels.
During 1995, 23 master-plan exercises were completed by national authorities and 16 more were initiated.
Twelve master plans are being considered for the future.
Of the 39 master plans initiated or completed during 1995, UNDCP assisted 28 countries in the exercise.
As requested by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its thirty-eighth session, the present report sets out options for the Commission to consider in reviewing master plans as part of its efforts to monitor the implementation of the Global Programme of Action.

VI. GUIDANCE REQUESTED FROM THE COMMISSION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS 45 9 INTRODUCTION
The promotion of national drug control plans (also referred to as master plans) has been a long-standing priority of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).
Recognition of the importance of promoting the development of such plans can be traced back to the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control adopted by the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.See Report of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Vienna, 17-26 June 1987 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.87.I.18), chap. I, sect. A.
National drug control plans are also considered of value as an additional means of monitoring implementation of the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session,See resolution S-17/2, annex. on 23 February 1990.
At its thirty-eighth session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs decided to include an item on national drug control plans in the agenda for the thirty-ninth session and requested the Executive Director to "submit a report to that session containing information on the status of such plans, along with specific options as to how the Commission might in future consider the matter in more depth".Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1995, Supplement No. 9 (E/1995/29), chap. IX, para. 180.
The present report has been prepared in response to that request.
I. THE CONCEPT OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PLANS
Faced with the growing threat and multifaceted problem of drug abuse, Governments have come to realize the urgent need to develop and implement a comprehensive set of responses, coordinated to achieve the maximum impact and relying on the active involvement of all government agencies and numerous bodies and institutions, including in the private sector, that play a role in drug control.
For such an undertaking to achieve success, it needs to be embodied in a clearly defined strategy document, referred to as a master plan by UNDCP.
A master plan is the single document adopted by a Government outlining all national concerns in drug control.
It is a tool designed to assess the extent and nature of the drug abuse problem, to set out a coordinated approach to its solution, and to identify consistent and comprehensive national drug control objectives.
In recognition of the national character of master plans, UNDCP has refrained from defining a detailed blueprint. Rather, it issued in 1994 a booklet entitled "Format and guidelines for the preparation of national Drug Control Master Plans", as a practical guide setting out the basic principles to be followed in the formulation of master plans for drug control and underlining some essential parameters that should be in place for the success of the exercise.
A number of Governments also include in the master plan aspects relating to abuse of substances such as alcohol and tobacco.
FORMULATING AND IMPLEMENTING NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PLANS
UNDCP has emphasized that government commitment is an essential prerequisite for a master plan.
In line with the concept of national ownership, Governments are the driving element in the planning exercise, assuming technical and managerial responsibility to the maximum possible extent.
At one end of the spectrum are countries with limited capabilities, where national commitment is not matched by adequate resources. In such cases, wherever the seriousness of the drug abuse problem justifies it, UNDCP has provided assistance in the form of a master-plan project for the delivery of technical advice, training and, in selected cases, limited management support and equipment.
In cases where national capabilities were deemed basically sufficient, UNDCP has provided mainly short-term technical expertise, with national institutions ensuring overall management of the exercise, deployment and coordination of resources and finalization of the proposal for submission to the authorities responsible for approval.
In such cases, it has been sufficient for UNDCP to provide only initial support, often in the form of a workshop to design or enhance awareness of the master plan.
Such a workshop served as a catalyst to draw the attention of the various institutional players to their role and responsibilities.
Finally, in cases where institutional development and overall resources were entirely adequate, UNDCP has provided information and guidelines upon request, or has responded to a request to review and comment on final drafts of master-plan documents.
III. STATUS OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PLANS
A. Overview
The present chapter reviews the progress made during 1995 in the various countries which engaged in master-plan exercises, either on their own initiative or with varying degrees of UNDCP encouragement.
Since master plans are of equal relevance for developed and developing countries alike, the analysis takes into account the situation in both country groupings.
While efforts have been made to ensure that the information presented is comprehensive, it must be recalled that not all countries formulating national drug control plans with their own resources keep UNDCP informed of their action.
Countries with ongoing master plans under implementation have not been separately identified, and attention is drawn to previous reports of the Commission on the subject.
During 1995, 23 master-plan exercises were completed and 16 were initiated.
National authorities in 12 additional countries are considering initiating master plans in the future.
UNDCP has provided assistance in respect of 28 out of the total of 39 master plans initiated or completed during 1995.
Five countries have sought support from UNDCP in the form of full-fledged master-plan projects, while for 23 others the provision of limited UNDCP assistance in the form of technical expertise has proven sufficient.
This underscores the general applicability of the master-plan concept to most situations, as well as the fact that UNDCP support, while essential is some cases, need not be the norm.
B. Africa
Algeria developed a draft outline for a national plan in 1994.
Further progress, including possible UNDCP assistance in the process of elaboration, is awaited.
Egypt has drafted a master-plan document, approval of which is still pending.
Morocco is currently considering elaboration of a programme of action.
In the first half of 1995, Namibia completed the formulation of a programme for the prevention and combating of substance abuse and illicit drug trafficking, to which UNDCP provided limited technical advisory support.
The plan also covers alcohol abuse, which has been identified by the authorities as one of the major types of substance abuse in the country.
Zambia has approved a project for the formulation of a master plan to be supported jointly by UNDCP and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
This is the first instance of a master-plan project with financing from an international agency other than UNDCP, a clear indication of the growing interest of the donor community in comprehensive drug control measures.
C. America and the Caribbean
Canada is currently implementing the second phase of its drug strategy covering the period from 1993 to 1997.
Mexico has completed action on its master plan up to the year 1994, and is currently developing a new one without requesting external inputs.
The United States has a national drug control strategy which underwent revision in 1995.
Costa Rica has developed a draft plan, yet to be finalized, and for which UNDCP support may be requested. Nicaragua developed its plan with assistance from UNDCP, while Panama, which has a yearly drug control plan at the operational level, has yet to decide whether it wishes to undertake a more comprehensive planning exercise.
Out of a total of 29 countries and territories in the Caribbean, 15 already have a master plan in draft or final form, while seven have just started the process of elaboration.
The 15 countries or territories with master plans in place are Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, Suriname, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and Turks and Caicos Islands.
The seven countries or territories where master plans are being implemented are British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Netherlands Antilles and Saint Kitts and Nevis.
For the other countries and territories, the formulation of a master plan is not envisaged at present.
The UNDCP regional office in Barbados has been promoting the master-plan concept and assisting countries in the region in preparing comprehensive drafts by providing an initial outline for discussion with local authorities.
One international staff member in the regional office is responsible for master-plan support and follow-up.
In 1995, Brazil elaborated drug control programmes for regions of the country that faced particularly serious drug problems, as well as a plan for law enforcement at the national level.
Aggregation of regional plans into a comprehensive national drug control plan has not taken place yet.
Paraguay, with assistance from a UNDCP consultant, developed a national drug control plan in the course of 1995, with emphasis on demand reduction and suppression of drug trafficking.
Venezuela relied exclusively on its own capabilities in developing a plan which was approved in August 1995.
D. Asia and the Pacific
In June 1995, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority participated, together with Egypt, in a subregional workshop at which the master-plan concept was presented.
In India and Sri Lanka, plans have been drafted, but are still awaiting official approval.
In both countries, pending approval of the overall strategy, selected priority aspects are taken up for implementation on their individual merit.
Pakistan completed a comprehensive master-plan exercise supported by a UNDCP project.
The draft was reviewed at provincial level before submission to the national Government for approval.
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were introduced to the UNDCP master-plan concept through a workshop, and both countries started, without UNDCP support, to develop three-year plans for implementation beginning in 1996.
Viet Nam completed a master-plan draft to which UNDCP provided project assistance; approval of the document is awaited.
Both Australia and Japan have national drug control master plans which are currently being implemented.
E. Europe
In April 1995, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia participated in a workshop to introduce the master-plan concept, which is now under consideration in those countries.
The Czech Republic already has a drug control strategy, though not a full-fledged master plan.
France, Germany, Malta, Russian Federation, Spain and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are all implementing drug control plans.
The European Union has developed an action plan against drugs covering the period from 1995 to 1999.
REGIONAL DRUG CONTROL PLANS
An increasing number of countries are showing interest in the master-plan concept and seeking assistance or advice to undertake such an exercise. This is particularly the case for countries in transition in central and eastern Europe, which are demonstrating deep concern at the spreading problem of drug abuse. Work on the plans is facilitated by the fact that new legislative frameworks are still being developed, and by the social and economic changes under way in those countries.
UNDCP intends to continue to promote the master-plan concept, and will pursue three specific lines of action.
The first line of action will involve countries in which there is already a significant drug abuse problem, or where signs of an emerging problem have been detected.
In those countries, UNDCP will continue to encourage formulation of a master plan, and will be prepared to consider the provision of assistance.
The second line of action will relate to countries that have already undertaken the formulation of a master plan.
In cases where the plans have been formally approved, implementation would be encouraged, taking into account, if necessary, the possibility of providing assistance in the process.
Such cooperation would essentially take the form of advice and assistance to the country in question to monitor progress and to identify changes that may be required as a result of changing circumstances, rather than in the form of direct technical assistance projects.
In cases where internal lack of resources and capabilities would impair the implementation of the master plan, UNDCP would consider assistance in donor mobilization and, where warranted, provision of selective project support.
UNDCP would also encourage Governments to establish their own monitoring mechanisms to follow implementation of the master plan, to update authorities on progress and to recommend adjustments where required.
Finally, as a third line of action, UNDCP would encourage, wherever appropriate, the extension of the master-plan concept through a subregional approach.
In such cases, subregional master plans would represent the coalescing at the subregional level of shared problems and approaches, due care being taken to recognize national differences and special areas of interest of individual countries.
Follow-up activities of UNDCP for the Africa region in 1996 will emphasize the approval of master-plan proposals finalized during 1995 and their subsequent implementation, together with implementation of those previously adopted.
A master-plan exercise in South Africa may be considered during 1996.
A master-plan component has been included in an institution-building project to assist the United Republic of Tanzania in developing its drug control structures and defining its priorities.
The master plan for Zambia will be implemented during 1996.C. America and the Caribbean
During 1996, activities in Latin America will cover the biennial updating of the drug control plan of Chile for 1997 and 1998, for which no UNDCP assistance is being requested, as well as the implementation of other approved and ongoing plans.
In the Caribbean, efforts will concentrate on finalizing plans in the seven countries and territories where they are currently being prepared.
Activities of UNDCP for 1996 in the Asia and the Pacific region cover implementation of ongoing or recently approved plans and their updating.
This would apply in particular to the plans of Bangladesh, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Nepal and Thailand, all currently being implemented but, almost midway through the process, requiring a comprehensive review of progress and, possibly, realignment to take into account emerging priorities.
Among countries expected to launch a master-plan exercise in 1996 are Indonesia, where limited advisory support is foreseen, and Malaysia, where a plan already exists for the period from 1993 to 1997, although interest in a revision has been expressed, and modalities of execution are still to be defined.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has also expressed interest in knowing more about the master-plan approach, and may decide to undertake such an exercise in the future.
In western Asia, a workshop is foreseen in early 1996 for Jordan and Lebanon, as a result of which a decision may be taken on whether to proceed to formulate national master plans.
E. Europe During 1996, the countries that participated in the master-plan familiarization workshop held in Eastern Europe in 1995, namely Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, may decide to initiate the formulation of master plans.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has requested UNDCP advice in the formulation of a drug control plan designed to complement parallel plans for the suppression of corruption, the control of money-laundering and the prevention of crime, in particular organized crime.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also requested UNDCP to introduce them to the master-plan concept, which they might consider adopting in future.
V. OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE COMMISSION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS FOR A. Proposed options
Many Governments of both developed and developing countries have prepared national drug control plans which represent a valuable source of knowledge and experience for Governments planning to start a similar exercise.
Existing national drug control plans can be used to compare strategies and provide a basis for the coordination of efforts at subregional, regional and global levels.
In that connection, it may be noted that the Commission bears explicit responsibility for monitoring the efforts of Governments to implement the Global Programme of Action, as reflected in Economic and Social Council resolution 1991/38 of 21 June 1991.
As national drug control plans represent a consolidated statement of the actions that individual Governments are taking or envisage taking, they can be used as a means of monitoring what is being done in furtherance of the Global Programme of Action.
Indeed, the ad hoc intergovernmental advisory group created as a result of Commission resolution 3 (XXXVII) of 21 April 1994 to advise on implementation of General Assembly resolution 48/12 of 28 October 1993 took up the question of monitoring the Global Programme of Action, and recommended that States should be encouraged to submit their national drug control plans for consideration either by the Commission itself or by a working group established for that purpose.
The Commission may therefore wish to establish a mechanism for sharing information on national master plans.
The Commission at its thirty-eighth session requested the Executive Director of UNDCP to propose specific options as to how it might do so.
To that end, two options are presented.
The first option would consist in considering master plans during sessions of the Commission, in either the plenary or the Committee of the Whole.
Under that option, the Commission would examine several master plans from different regions submitted by Governments on a voluntary basis.
Each plan would be introduced by a representative of the Government concerned, who should be from the drug control coordinating body or from another such institution bearing responsibility for the implementation of the plan.
A question-and-answer session would follow, allowing members of the Commission to seek further information and make observations on the plan.
Consideration of each plan would conclude with closing remarks by the representative of the Government submitting the plan.
The proceedings would be summarized in the report of the Commission.
A second option could consist in establishing a small expert committee that would be charged specifically with the task involved.
The expert committee would be composed of drug control specialists who would serve in a personal and technical capacity.
Geographical considerations would be taken into account in selecting members.
A total of 10 members would permit the inclusion of two experts from each of the five regional groups.
Each of the regional groups could submit three candidates for each post to be filled.
Appointments would be made by the Chairman of the Commission after consultation with the relevant regional groups.
The members of the committee would be appointed for a specific period of time, following, for example, the four-year cycle of the Commission.
At least one master plan per region should be examined at each session.
Modalities for selection of master plans to be considered by the expert committee would be the same as for review in plenary.
The expert committee would review the plans in the light of the expert knowledge of its members.
Their findings would be summarized in the report of the expert committee to the Commission.
Master plans to be reviewed by the expert committee would be circulated to the experts in advance of their meetings.
A working session of four or five working days would follow, allowing the committee to consider six to eight plans per year.
The expert committee would report to the Commission.
To ensure the timely circulation of its report, the committee would meet about three months prior to the session of the Commission.
The report would contain a summary of the elements of each master plan considered, highlighting those points which have a bearing on other countries.
It would reflect the main observations made by the experts in the course of the deliberations, as well as the answers by the submitting Governments.
Consideration of plans in any appropriate international forum could foster the exchange of experience and up-to-date information.
Governments wishing to do so could also report back to the subsequent sessions of the body concerned on any amendments or additions to the plan made as a consequence of its review.
B. Financial implications The proposal to review master plans in plenary bears no financial implications.
On the other hand, an expert committee would require approximately US$ 200,000 yearly for the annual meeting of 10 experts at Vienna and secretariat support. VI. GUIDANCE REQUESTED FROM THE COMMISSION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS
The Commission is asked to advise on the proposals contained in paragraphs 38 to 43 above, in particular on the option of considering master plans in plenary or through an expert committee.

LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 18 August 1995
Sir, In its report a year ago the Committee observed that "events in Rwanda have also demonstrated that it would be more effective to take preventive action before open hostilities break out.
Procedures for early warning and urgent action desperately need improvement".
During the present year the Committee has taken several initiatives to improve its contribution to the prevention of racial discrimination.
In many conflicts sentiments of ethnic belonging are mixed with sentiments of a religious or political character.
The text of the Convention provides little guidance on the differentiation of ethnic from political motivation, while the position is further complicated by its definition of racial discrimination as covering distinctions which are racial either in their purpose or in their effect.
In several of the situations considered during 1995, Committee members were uncertain whether the ethnic elements in the apparent tensions were sufficient to bring the situation within the scope of the Convention.
They concluded that they should first request further information from the State party and decide later whether the Convention had any bearing upon the situation in question.
This action on the Committee's part is described in chapter II of the present report, dealing with preventive measures.
United Nations policies against racial discrimination have usually concentrated upon extreme forms like apartheid or "ethnic cleansing".
They have neglected the importance of everyday discrimination, whether it be based upon race, ethnic origin, gender, age, social class or disability, and the features which these have in common.
By way of example, we cite the resolutions of the General Assembly on the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination which referred to "all forms of racism and racial discrimination, whether in their institutionalized form or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity" (49/146, para. 1).
The Committee has identified many forms of racial discrimination which are neither institutionalized nor the result of official doctrines.
Racial discrimination occurs, or can occur, in almost any circumstances and has many causes.
Any statement on this subject should take account of the principal lessons that have been learned since the adoption of the Convention in 1965.
Many State officials have only a partial understanding of racial discrimination.
For example, in 1994, 16 States informed the United Nations that racial discrimination and xenophobia did not exist on their territory (A/49/677, para. 45).
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has found, to the contrary, that it is everywhere possible for a person to receive less favourable treatment because of his or her race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
It is sad that, 25 years after the Committee started its work, its contributions have not been better studied and better understood.
The Committee therefore welcomes the studies being conducted as part of the Migration for Employment Programme of the International Labour Office which, by the use of experimental methods, illuminate the nature and
Comparable studies could well be carried out in other fields, such as housing.
If such studies were to be conducted in countries which believe themselves to be free from racial discrimination, the findings might well be salutary.
Chapter III of the present report describes the Committee's consideration of the implementation of the Convention in 22 States.
In 18 instances this consideration has been based upon periodic reports submitted by the State party.
In two cases it has been based upon the Committee's procedure in respect of States whose periodic reports are seriously overdue; one of these have now been reviewed for a second time under this procedure.
The States parties at their sixteenth meeting may like to consider whether any action is needed from them when periodic reports have been overdue for such long periods.
The Committee's activities in respect of the prevention of discrimination have added greatly to its workload and are obliging it to adjust its working methods.
Subsequent chapters of this report describe the Committee's action in respect of individual communications, the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (including its collaboration with the Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities), the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, and meetings with the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the former Yugoslavia and on racism and xenophobia.
The Committee has adopted a general recommendation on article 3 of the Convention and has given consideration to proposed general recommendations on article 5, and on the relevance to the Convention of the right of self-determination.
Mr. T. Mazowiecki advised the Committee against following the reasoning of those who say that they cannot live in a pluralistic society, but the Committee had already gone on record (A/48/18, paras. 468-469) as "concerned that partition along ethnic lines in Bosnia and Herzegovina could encourage groups elsewhere who were unwilling to respect the territorial integrity of States.
The Committee strongly supported the principle of multi-ethnic societies ... ."
Nothing has happened since then to weaken our support for this principle, and much has happened to underline its importance.
Frontiers are to be preserved, and people have to be helped to live peacefully with all others whose homes are within these frontiers.
The prevention of discrimination is crucial to future peace.
(Signed) Ivan Garvalov Chairman

9. In accordance with Committee decision 2 (VI) of 21 August 1972 concerning cooperation with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2/ both organizations were invited to attend the sessions of the Committee.
10. Reports of the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, submitted to the International Labour Conference, were made available to the members of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in accordance with arrangements for cooperation between the two Committees.
The Committee took note with appreciation of the reports of the Committee of Experts, in particular of those sections which dealt with the application of the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111) and the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957 (No. 107), as well as other information in the reports relevant to its activities.
F. Other matters
11. Mr. Ibrahima Fall, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, addressed the Committee at the opening of the forty-sixth session (see CERD/C/SR.1071).
12. At its 1070th meeting (forty-sixth session), held on 27 February 1995, the Committee observed one minute of respectful silence in memory of Mr. Andr√© Braunschweig, former member of the Committee, and Mrs. Kati David, Secretary-General of the Anti-Racism Information Service (ARIS), and paid tribute to Mr. Enayat Houshmand who had recently retired from his service with the United Nations and who had made substantive and dedicated contributions to the Committee since its beginning in 1970.
13. The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Tadeuz Mazowiecki, met with the Committee at its 1071st meeting, held on 27 February 1995.
Mr. Mazowiecki explained his working methods and current concerns, and the members of the Committee held a dialogue with him with regard to his analysis of the nature of the conflicts currently taking place in States on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
14. At its 1070th meeting, held on 27 February 1995, the Committee decided to conduct a general debate on the subject of racial discrimination.
The general debate occurred at the 1073rd and 1074th meetings, held on 28 February and 1 March 1995.
In the course of the discussion, members made reference, inter alia, to the origins of the phenomenon of racial discrimination, the implementation and effectiveness of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the need to improve cooperation between the various international responses to racial discrimination, the working methods of the Committee and the value of drafting new general recommendations.
Concerning the first two points it was noted that there had been a rise in expressions of racial hatred and a recurrence of the propagation of absurd racist theories.
In that regard concern was expressed as to the extent of implementation of article 4 of the Convention.
Members also considered that the Committee should devote closer attention to the implementation of the obligations contained in article 7 of the Convention with regard to the development of programmes of education to combat racist thought and racial discrimination.
15. During the general debate members expressed the view that the Committee's working methods might be improved and there was emphasis on the need for improved flows of relevant information from other international sources, such as on the activities of special rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights and of other treaty bodies.
A number of members drew attention to the importance of close collaboration with the Council of Europe in order to share information and to develop complementary rather than potentially competing work practices.
The important role of non-governmental organizations in informally presenting information to Committee members was stressed.
16. It was agreed during the general debate that the Committee should draft a general recommendation on the issue of self-determination which would indicate the position of the Committee on that very important matter.
A number of members also proposed that the Committee and the other treaty bodies should be represented when the General Assembly discussed their annual reports, in order to present the reports orally and to hold direct discussion with the Member States at the General Assembly.
17. At its 1098th meeting, held on 17 March 1995, the Committee adopted decision 9 (46), entitled "Contribution of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education", indicating the provisions of the Convention which address the issue of education to counter racial discrimination, drawing attention to the continuing work of the Committee in implementing those provisions, and offering comments on elements of the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (A/49/261/Add.1).
The text of the decision is reproduced in annex III.
18. At its 1125th meeting, held on 17 August 1995, the Committee adopted general recommendation XIX (47) on article 3.
The text of the general recommendation is reproduced in annex VII.
G. Adoption of the report
19. At its 1127th meeting, held on 18 August 1995, the Committee adopted its annual report to the General Assembly.
II. PREVENTION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, INCLUDING EARLY WARNING AND URGENT PROCEDURES
20. The Committee decided at its forty-first session to establish as one of its regular and principal agenda items, the item on the prevention of racial discrimination, including early warning and urgent procedures.
21. At its forty-second session (1993), the Committee noted the conclusion adopted by the fourth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies that:
"... the treaty bodies have an important role in seeking to prevent as well as to respond to human rights violations.
It is thus appropriate for each treaty body to undertake an urgent examination of all possible measures that it might take, within its competence, both to prevent human rights violations from occurring and to monitor more closely emergency situations of all kinds arising within the jurisdiction of States parties.
Where procedural innovations are required for this purpose, they should be considered as soon as possible" (A/47/628, para. 44).
In that connection, criteria for early warning could include some of the following concerns: the lack of an adequate legislative basis for defining and criminalizing all forms of racial discrimination, as provided for in the Convention; inadequate implementation of enforcement mechanisms, including the lack of recourse procedures; the presence of a pattern of escalating racial hatred and violence, or racist propaganda or appeals to racial intolerance by persons, groups or organizations, notably by elected or other officials; a significant pattern of racial discrimination evidenced in social and economic indicators; and significant flows of refugees or displaced persons resulting from a pattern of racial discrimination or encroachment on the lands of minority communities;
(b) Urgent procedures: these would aim at responding to problems requiring immediate attention to prevent or limit the scale or number of serious violations of the Convention.
Possible criteria for initiating an urgent procedure could include the presence of a serious, massive or persistent pattern of racial discrimination; or that the situation is serious and there is a risk of further racial discrimination.
23. At its 1028th and 1029th meetings, held on 10 March 1994, the Committee considered possible amendments to its rules of procedure which would take into account the working paper it had adopted in 1993 on the prevention of racial discrimination, including early warning and urgent procedures.
During the discussions which followed, the view was expressed that it was too early to make changes in the rules of procedure in order to take account of procedures adopted only very recently.
There was a risk that the Committee might be locking itself into rules which would soon no longer fit needs.
It would, therefore, be better for the Committee to have more experience with the procedures in question and to amend its rules at a later point on the basis of that experience.
At its 1039th meeting, held on 17 March 1994, the Committee decided to postpone to a later session further consideration of proposals to amend its rules of procedure.
24. The following sections describe decisions adopted and further action taken by the Committee at its forty-sixth and forty-seventh sessions within the framework of its efforts to prevent racial discrimination.
At earlier sessions the Committee had commenced consideration under this agenda item of Israel, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Papua New Guinea, Rwanda and Burundi.
At the forty-sixth session the Committee decided also to consider under this agenda item the Russian Federation, Mexico, Algeria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
At the forty-sixth session decisions were adopted concerning the Russian Federation, Mexico, Algeria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Burundi, Rwanda and Papua New Guinea.
The situation in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Israel was considered at the forty-sixth session under agenda item 3 and is reported accordingly.
At the forty-seventh session decisions were adopted concerning Burundi, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Papua New Guinea.
At the forty-seventh session further consideration of the Russian Federation and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was deferred to the forty-eighth session.
Action at the forty-seventh session concerning Algeria is described below.
The situation in Mexico was considered at the forty-seventh session under agenda item 3 and is reported accordingly.
A. Decisions adopted by the Committee
25. The following decisions were adopted by the Committee under this agenda item at its forty-sixth session.
1 (46). Report requested urgently from the Russian Federation
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination views with concern the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya.
It expresses alarm over the disproportionate use of force by the Russian armed forces and the massive loss of life which has resulted in Chechnya.
The Committee deplores the destruction of civilian property.
It condemns all violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law. It calls for all those who have committed such violations to be brought to justice.
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination calls urgently for an immediate cessation to the fighting and for a dialogue to achieve a peaceful solution while respecting the territorial integrity and the Constitution of the Russian Federation.
The twelfth and thirteenth periodic reports of the Russian Federation were due on 5 March 1992 and 1994 respectively.
Bearing in mind its powers under article 9, paragraph 1 (b), of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Committee requests the Russian Federation to expedite its periodic reports to permit their consideration at the Committee's forty-seventh session.

2 (46). Decision on the situation in Mexico
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expresses its concern about reports of serious conflicts in the State of Chiapas which particularly affect some indigenous populations in Mexico.
The Committee has received the ninth and tenth periodic reports of Mexico and scheduled them for consideration at its forty-seventh session in August 1995.
In accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Committee requests the Government of Mexico to submit further information on the situation in Chiapas in time for consideration together with the ninth and tenth reports.
The Committee decides to bring this text to the attention of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
3 (46). Reports requested urgently from Algeria
Alarmed by the continuing violence in Algeria, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, requests the Government of Algeria to expedite its eleventh and twelfth periodic reports, due on 15 March 1993 and 1995 respectively, with particular reference to article 5 (b) of the Convention.
1089th meeting
10 March 1995
4 (46). Report requested urgently from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Concerned by reports of ethnic tension, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination requests the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to expedite its initial report, due on 18 January 1995, in order to facilitate consideration at the Committee's forty-seventh session of the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
6 (46). Report requested urgently from Burundi
The Committee is alarmed by reports of the atmosphere of impunity prevailing in Burundi and supports the appeal for an increased international presence made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 16 February 1995 to prevent further deterioration of the situation.
1097th meeting
16 March 1995
7 (46). Rwanda
The Committee expresses its dismay at the tragic circumstances prevailing in Rwanda and endorses the conclusions of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Rwanda (E/CN.4/1995/71, paras. 49-51).
It underlines his statement in paragraph 50 that very rapid action is required if the international community is not to be the powerless spectator of a second war and further massacres, and his recommendation 4 (b) about the convening of an international conference.
The Committee also underlines the conclusions of the representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons (see E/CN.4/1995/50/Add.4) concerning the importance of international action to secure the return of displaced persons.
The Committee decides that this text should be transmitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
8 (46). Papua New Guinea
The Committee reiterates its concluding observations, adopted at its 1010th meeting, on 19 August 1993, and at its 1060th meeting, on 12 August 1994, in which it expressed concern at reports of serious human rights violations in Bougainville, including summary executions and population transfers, as well as possible large-scale mining operations in Bougainville without due regard to the rights of the ethnically distinct population or the adverse effects of environmental degradation.
It notes with appreciation that a process to re-establish peace on the Papua New Guinea island of Bougainville has been initiated and that the "Mirigini Charter" was signed on 25 November 1994.
The Committee, however, notes with concern that most leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the organization known as the Bougainville Interim Government did not participate in the Bougainville Peace Conference, held in October 1994, which provided the basis for discussions leading to the signing of the "Mirigini Charter".
The Committee urges that in the future all parties participate in the negotiations towards a total cessation of armed conflict and the restoration of peace, which is crucial to the full implementation of human rights without distinction as to race, colour or national or ethnic origin.
The Committee renews its offer to the Government of Papua New Guinea to provide assistance in efforts to strengthen national mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights and in particular for protection against racial discrimination.
It calls upon the Government of Papua New Guinea to renew its dialogue with the Committee, in accordance with article 9 of the Convention, and to expedite its periodic reports which were due on 26 February 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1995, respectively, and which should contain specific information on the situation prevailing on the island of Bougainville.
Such information should reach the Committee in time to be considered at its forty-seventh session in August 1995.
26. The following decisions were adopted by the Committee under this agenda item at its forty-seventh session.
1 (47). The situation in Burundi
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,
Alarmed by reports of the breakdown of law and order in large parts of the territory of Burundi, a State party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which is leading to a further deterioration in a critical situation that has the potential for genocide,
Recalling its decision 2 (45) on the same subject, and reiterating the concerns and recommendations contained in that decision,
Fearing that the breakdown of law and order may cancel the benefits of the current efforts of the United Nations to support civil institutions in the country,
Endorsing the recommendations of the Representative of the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1995/50/Add.2, chap. III) and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (E/CN.4/1996/4/Add.1, chap. VI),
Decides:
(a) To ask the General Assembly and the Security Council to take decisive steps with a view to stopping all violence and preventing another explosive conflict and to begin, in cooperation with the Government and all political forces in Burundi, to implement the following recommendations, in particular:
(i) A new police force should be created, staffed by persons drawn proportionately from all ethnic groups who have not been implicated in earlier human rights violations and who can act expeditiously when there is any risk of further ethnic violence;
(ii) The army should be reduced in size and organized for the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.
In the prevailing circumstances the army should not be used for the suppression of civil disorders.
A programme should be adopted to ensure that, within the present generation, the army is composed of persons drawn proportionately from all ethnic groups;
(iii) The judiciary and the civil administration should be reorganized and retrained so that they represent the whole society.
The functioning and impartiality of the criminal courts require close attention.
Human rights violations on the part of the military must be treated as criminal offences;
(iv) Measures should be taken as a matter of urgency to halt incitement to or promotion of racial or ethnic hatred disseminated by radio or other mass media and to ensure that those responsible for such incitement or promotion are brought to justice.
A special chamber of the court of Bujumbura should be created to deal with criminal offences committed by those responsible for such violations;
(v) Residential neighbourhoods of Bujumbura which previously were ethnically mixed should be rehabilitated.
New associations should be established to channel the energies of young people into economic rehabilitation and social development;
(vi) A national institution for the promotion and protection of human rights should be established in accordance with recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
The institution should implement programmes and projects to combat ethnic prejudices and promote peaceful relations between the various ethnic groups of the society;
(vii) An international presence should be maintained including, in particular, the maintenance of a team of human rights observers;
(b) Also to ask the General Assembly to appeal to all States and to the Security Council to halt the supply of arms to all parties until law and order in Burundi are secured.
1124th meeting
16 August 1995
Concerned at the massive, gross and systematic human rights violations which continue to occur on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and reiterating its concluding observations adopted at its 1097th meeting, held on 16 March 1995,
Deeply concerned about reports that attacks, particularly on the United Nations Protected Areas of Srebrenica and Zepa, in the Krajina area, as well as in other places, were directed against civilians and civilian installations, and about grave mistreatment of, crimes committed against and killing of innocent civilians, contrary to international humanitarian law and relevant Security Council resolutions,
Alarmed that the hostilities in and around Srebrenica and Zepa, in the Krajina area, as well as in other places, have resulted in a significant flow of refugees and in the eviction and detention of persons, resulting in an "ethnic cleansing" of the areas concerned,
Deeply concerned that according to reports many of the former inhabitants of the United Nations Protected Areas of Srebrenica and Zepa, of the Krajina region and of other places have disappeared and still cannot be accounted for,
(a) Firmly to re-emphasize that any attempt to change or to uphold a changed demographic composition of an area against the will of the original inhabitants, by whatever means, is a violation of international law;
(b) To demand that all parties to the conflicts fully ensure the safety of all detained persons under their control and disclose all information concerning all missing persons;
(c) Also to demand that persons be given the opportunity to return safely to the places they inhabited before the beginning of the conflict and that their safety be guaranteed, as well as their effective participation in the conduct of public life;
(d) Urgently to call upon the international community, in particular all the European States, to render assistance to refugees and detained persons directly and through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross and all other organizations involved in assistance to refugees;
(e) Firmly to re-emphasize that all those who commit violations of international humanitarian law or war crimes shall be held individually responsible for such acts, calls upon all States to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the prosecution of war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, and demands that States implement the necessary legislation to ensure their unimpeded and effective cooperation with the International Tribunal;
(f) Urgently to call for the provision to Bosnia and Herzegovina of all means to protect itself in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and to live within safe and secure borders;
(g) To express its solidarity with the former Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, agreeing with him that the response of the international community has been slow and ineffectual in reacting to the massive human rights violations in Bosnia and Herzegovina;
(h) To transmit the present resolution immediately to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his attention and, through him, to the General Assembly and the Security Council, and recommends that the United Nations take all necessary measures to provide for the strict implementation of resolutions in the areas referred to and in particular to undertake urgent efforts for the assistance to refugees and detained persons.
1126th meeting
17 August 1995
3 (47). The situation in Papua New Guinea
The Committee refers to its concluding observations adopted at its 1010th meeting, on 19 August 1993, and at its 1060th meeting, on 12 August 1994, together with its decision 8 (46), adopted at its 1097th meeting, on 16 March 1995.
In decision 8 (46) the Committee reiterated its concerns regarding ongoing human rights violations in Bougainville, welcomed positive developments such as the signing of the "Mirigini Charter", and urged that all sectors of the population be permitted to play a part in programmes for the restoration of a durable peace.
The Committee also requested the Government to expedite outstanding periodic reports, due for submission under article 9 of the Convention, in time for their consideration by the Committee at the present session.
The Committee regrets the failure of the Government to submit the outstanding reports or to otherwise respond to the request of the Committee to renew a dialogue.
The Committee again calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to halt and redress human rights abuses in Bougainville based on ethnic grounds.
In particular, it should undertake confidence-building measures enabling all the people of Bougainville to participate directly in decisions and processes directed towards a peace settlement and the re-establishment of civil society.
The Committee reiterates its request to the Government that it submit without further delay outstanding reports under article 9 of the Convention, preferably in time for their consideration at the forty-eighth session of the Committee in March 1996.
The Committee notes that the information on the human rights situation received by the Secretariat is not sufficient to assess the situation in Bougainville.
The Committee brings the present decision to the attention of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and requests him to take any possible action under his mandate towards its implementation.
B. Further action taken by the Committee
27. The Committee, in its decision 3(46), entitled "Reports requested urgently from Algeria", adopted at its 1089th meeting, on 10 March 1995, expressed its alarm at the continuing violence in Algeria and requested the Government of that country to expedite its eleventh and twelfth periodic reports, due on 15 March 1993 and 1995 respectively, with particular reference to article 5 (b) of the Convention.
28. The Committee welcomed the attendance at its 1119th meeting, held on 14 August 1995, of the representative of the Government of Algeria, as well as the indication that a full written report would soon be submitted.
The representative presented information on the current situation in the country, particularly with regard to the treatment of foreigners.
The representative emphasized that his Government abhorred attacks on foreigners, vigorously pursued perpetrators, and in all respects ensured that foreign victims of crime were treated equally to citizen victims.
He noted, for instance, that citizens and non-citizens alike could benefit from programmes of compensation for personal injuries and damage to property.
29. Members of the Committee expressed appreciation for the information provided by the representative.
They noted the commitment of his Government to submit a written report and requested that it be submitted in time for consideration at a session of the Committee in 1996.
Members indicated that, prior to submission of that report, there was continued uncertainty as to the extent to which the ongoing violence was a subject of specific concern to the Committee within the provisions of the Convention, although they noted their competence with regard to attacks directed against foreigners.
In that regard, members welcomed the initiatives taken by the Government to protect foreigners.
III. CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS, COMMENTS AND INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 9 OF THE CONVENTION
A. Reports considered
30. At its forty-sixth and forty-seventh sessions, the Committee considered reports, comments and information from 22 States parties under article 9 of the Convention.
Country rapporteurs are listed in annex VI.
Trinidad and Tobago
32. The reports were introduced by the representative of the State party who indicated that since the submission of the last report, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago had enacted a series of laws intended to promote the interests of various sectoral interest groups.
The representative then emphasized that the information on the ethnic and religious composition of the population provided by the most recent census was merely one of record-keeping for statistical purposes.
The Government continued to maintain that the categorization of the population along those lines might lead to racial division and disharmony, and that the country should not pursue strategies for development which divided the nation along racial or ethnic lines.
The Government had worked to integrate all the people of Trinidad and Tobago, on a non-discriminatory basis, into one society.
33. Members of the Committee welcomed the fact that Trinidad and Tobago had decided to resume submitting periodic reports after a hiatus of eight years and urged the Government to continue its renewed dialogue with the Committee.
34. Members of the Committee asked why the Caribs had all but disappeared, exactly how many were left, why they were not treated as a separate racial group and whether measures were being taken to help them, particularly in the economic and educational fields, so as to compensate them for the injustices they had suffered.
35. Members of the Committee also asked why there were no political refugees in Trinidad and Tobago, although in some neighbouring countries political persecution was resulting in flows of refugees, or whether the refugees in Trinidad and Tobago enjoyed some other status.
36. With regard to article 4, members of the Committee noted, as during the consideration of the sixth report, that the Sedition Act posed a problem in that a seditious intention, as defined by the Act, was extremely difficult to prove in practice and that the Act, while it admittedly conformed to the provisions of article 4 (a), in no way conformed to those of subparagraph (b).
It did not seem enough to condemn organizations or organized groups preaching discrimination in any form.
Members therefore wondered whether specific legislative measures had been taken since 1987 to supplement existing measures concerning the implementation of article 4.
37. Regarding the implementation of the provisions of article 5 of the Convention, some members of the Committee noted that it would be helpful to have the results of the survey of recruitment practices in the public and private sectors which was scheduled to be carried out in 1994, and to know whether the survey had revealed cases of racial discrimination in hiring.
Some members of the Committee asked why the numbers of Trinidad nationals of African origin employed in the public and private sectors differed from the numbers of those of Indian origin employed, although the size of the two communities was about the same.
They asked whether measures had been taken by the Government to redress that ethnic imbalance with regard to employment.
On the question of education, members of the Committee asked why there was such an overwhelming predominance of Catholic schools, while Hindu schools seemed few in number.
Members also asked whether all social groups enjoyed equal access to higher education.
38. With regard to article 6, members noted that victims of acts of discrimination could apply to the High Court and asked whether Trinidad law provided for remedy procedures which were less protracted and less costly and whether the fact that no cases of alleged State violations of human rights on grounds of race, origin, colour, religion or sex had been brought before the High Court might not be due to unfamiliarity with the provisions of the Convention.
39. On article 7, members asked about the existence of information programmes designed to familiarize police officers with the provisions of the Convention.
40. Finally, members asked whether the Trinidad authorities intended to make the declaration referred to in article 14 of the Convention and, in accordance with the Committee's general recommendation XVII (42) and with various recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations General Assembly, establish a national institution to facilitate the implementation of the Convention.
41. In reply to the Committee's questions and observations, the representative of the State party explained that Trinidad had no refugee problem because people wishing to emigrate went to other countries in the region, such as the United States of America.
However, two members of a Haitian junior football team had recently applied for, and been granted, refugee status.
42. There were historical reasons for the differences in the distribution of ethnic groups between the public and private sectors.
Following the abolition of slavery, former slaves, who were of African descent, settled in towns, while people of Indian descent, who had been hired as agricultural workers, remained in the rural areas, mainly where sugar cane was grown.
43. There was no racial obstacle to access to education.
Students wishing to take higher studies were selected on the basis of their examination results at the end of secondary school.
Similarly, students wishing to take secondary studies must sit an entrance examination which was the same throughout the country.
Concluding observations
44. At its 1094th meeting, held on 15 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
(a) Introduction
45. Appreciation is expressed as to the submission of the report and the readiness of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to resume, after a break of eight years, a dialogue with the Committee.
It is noted with regret that the report under consideration did not comply with the Committee's revised general guidelines for the preparation of reports.
However, the oral dialogue allowed the Committee to re-establish cooperation with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago with a view to the effective implementation of the provisions of the Convention.
(b) Positive aspects
46. Appreciation is expressed with regard to the commitment of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to combat racial discrimination and hatred and the efforts made by the State party to comply with the provisions of the Convention.
(c) Principal subjects of concern
47. It is noted that there is a lack of information provided by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago with regard to the legal status of the Convention in the domestic legislation.
Concern is expressed at the failure to adopt legislative, administrative and other measures implementing article 4 of the Convention (especially paragraph (b)).
It is noted that the report did not provide adequate information on access of the various ethnic groups to primary, secondary and tertiary education.
It is also regretted that the report did not give a clear picture of the actual implementation of articles 6 and 7 of the Convention.
(d) Suggestions and recommendations
48. The Committee calls upon the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to report to the Committee on a regular basis, in compliance with its obligations under article 9 of the Convention.
The Committee recommends that appropriate consideration be given by the State party to the effective implementation of article 4 of the Convention, especially paragraph (b), in national legislation.
The Committee recommends that more publicity be given to make the public aware of the right to seek from national tribunals just and adequate reparation for any damage suffered as a result of racial discrimination.
The Committee further recommends that police officials receive intensive training to ensure that in the performance of their duties they uphold the human rights of all persons without distinction as to race, colour, descent or ethnic origin.
The Committee, noting that the eleventh report of Trinidad and Tobago was due on 4 November 1994, invites the Government to submit a brief report on matters outstanding as a result of the Committee's consideration of the tenth report.
It expects the twelfth report to be comprehensive and to be submitted by 4 November 1996.
49. The Committee considered the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth periodic reports of Cyprus (CERD/C/263/Add.1) at its 1077th and 1078th meetings, held on 2 and 3 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1077-1078).
50. In introducing the report, the representative of the State party stated that his country had a system of legal provisions which guaranteed and safeguarded human rights, and that international legal provisions were superior to all non-constitutional law.
He noted that Cyprus had made the declaration under article 14 of the Convention and was considering ratification of the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6.
Attention was also drawn to the new law which, in compliance with article 4 of the Convention, penalized certain behaviour.
51. The representative referred to the occupation of part of his country's territory by Turkish forces and drew attention to the consequent inability of the Government to guarantee human rights in those areas.
Violations of human rights were said to occur in those areas and to affect people of varied ethnic origins.
52. The Committee members expressed satisfaction as to the quality of the report, the presence of a high-level government delegation and the additional information provided orally.
Among the governmental initiatives which were welcomed were the new laws enhancing implementation of article 4, the various educational initiatives which implemented article 7, the making of the declaration under article 14 and the steps taken towards ratification of the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention.
53. The members deplored the continued occupation of part of the territory of the State party.
Among the gravest of the effects of the occupation was a form of "ethnic cleansing" and the resultant changes in demographic composition.
Requests were made for updated demographic information.
It was asked whether the Government could do more to foster reconciliation with the separatists.
54. Concerning article 2 of the Convention members asked for further information on the general legal regime for protection of human rights and expressed surprise that no one should ever have invoked those provisions.
Details were requested concerning the role of the Supreme Court in matters of human rights adjudication.
55. Some members expressed unease concerning the definition of incitement to racial hatred as requiring specific intent.
56. With regard to implementation of article 5 members requested further information on the protection of religious rights, including information on the effects of the apparently hierarchical listing of religions in the Constitution.
Questions were also asked concerning the extent of genuine equality enjoyed by members of minority religions such as the Muslim community (including Muslims of Turkish origin).
57. Concerning articles 6 and 7 of the Convention a number of members asked whether the lack of recourse to legal procedures to protect human rights might be due to a lack of education in those matters.
It was also suggested that the public might lack confidence in the existing procedures.
A member asked specific questions about human rights education at various levels of the school system.
58. In replying to the questions of the members the representative of the State party expressed his gratitude for a useful dialogue with the Committee and gave assurances that matters not dealt with orally would be addressed in the next report of his country.
59. Concerning the various issues arising from the naming of religious groups in the Constitution he expressed regret that the terms of the Constitution were imposed on his country as a condition of its independence and that any amendments would be problematic.
60. Further details were provided on the human rights violations perpetrated in the occupied parts of the territory of the State party including confiscations of the property of non-Muslims and the preferential treatment given to "colonists" from Turkey.
He noted that the Greek Cypriot community, 82 per cent of the entire population, was now restricted to 63 per cent of the territory.
A number of international initiatives emphasizing the territorial integrity of Cyprus were described.
The representative stated that the entire responsibility for the ongoing crisis in Cyprus was attributable to Turkey.
61. Information was provided on the manner in which human rights matters were dealt with by the courts and the role of the Supreme Court.
62. The representative assured the Committee that freedom of religion was constitutionally ensured and strictly respected including in matters of non-discriminatory employment practices.
63. Details were given of the range of educational and publicity initiatives sponsored or supported by the Government concerning awareness of human rights issues.
Thus, for instance, considerable media attention focused on such events as the annual day for the elimination of racial discrimination.
Public officials were trained in human rights matters.
It was also explained that the press enjoyed full freedom from government interference and that education was provided at the university level in both the Greek and Turkish languages.
64. At its 1094th meeting, held on 15 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
65. The opportunity to continue the constructive and frank dialogue with the State party is welcomed.
It is noted with satisfaction that the report was prepared by a committee composed of representatives of governmental ministries directly involved with matters relating to the implementation of the Convention.
Appreciation is expressed at the presence of a high-level delegation, which serves as an indication of the importance the State party attaches to the implementation of the Convention, and for the additional information it presented orally to the Committee.
66. The legislative measures introduced with a view to enhancing the implementation of article 4 of the Convention are welcomed.
67. Satisfaction is expressed as regards the measures taken to promote the objectives of article 7 of the Convention.
In this connection, the initiatives taken within the fields of education and information with a view to combating prejudices which may lead to racial discrimination, as well as to promoting understanding and tolerance among nations and to developing awareness of the human rights provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the present Convention, deserve special mention.
68. It is noted with appreciation that the Government has made the declaration provided for under article 14 of the Convention recognizing the Committee's competence to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the rights set forth in the Convention.
It is also noted with satisfaction that the State party has initiated procedures for its acceptance of the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, which is concerned with budgetary matters relating to the work of the Committee.
69. It is also noted with satisfaction that the State is a party to numerous international and regional human rights instruments under which supervisory mechanisms have been established.
70. It is deplored that since 1974 the State party, due to the lengthy occupation of part of Cyprus by Turkish forces and the continued division of the country, is not in a position to exercise control over the whole of its territory and in consequence cannot ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Convention throughout the country.
According to recent reports received, this reality has led to changes in the demographic composition of the population due to the increasing illegal settlement of persons from Turkey in the occupied area of Cyprus.
The Committee requests the Government of Cyprus to furnish it with information on developments concerning the occupation of parts of Cyprus by Turkish forces as soon as possible.
71. While welcoming the enactment of Law 11 of 1992 which created offences regarding acts amounting to racial discrimination, a question is raised about whether the wording of certain passages in section 2A meet completely the requirements of article 4 (a) of the Convention.
72. The Committee wishes the State party to provide, in its next report, further information on the demographic composition of the population, the trends as regards immigration to and emigration from the country and the breakdown by community and ethnic group as regards their economic and social situation.
73. The Committee would also like to receive information in the State party's next report on the implementation of articles 2 and 6 of the Convention, including as regards any complaints of racial discrimination received, the outcome of the prosecution of any cases of racial discrimination and the redress, if any, provided to persons suffering from such discrimination.
74. The Committee expresses grave concern at the deprivation of the specific rights guaranteed under the Convention of a great number of Cypriots due to the Turkish occupation of part of the territory of Cyprus, and reiterates its call for an end to this totally unacceptable state of affairs.
The Committee also expresses its solidarity with the displaced people of Cyprus, its Vice-Chairman, Michael E. Sherifis, among them, and reiterates the earnest hope that they will be enabled, without further delay, to exercise their freedom of movement and residence and their right to property, as provided in article 5 (d) (i) and (v) of the Convention.
75. The Committee has taken note of the information provided in paragraphs 21 to 24 of the report which make reference to religious groups and the rights accorded to them by the Constitution.
Although the Committee would have preferred to refer to them as ethnic groups, it is fully aware that the respective constitutional provisions of Cyprus are based upon international agreement which are not within the power of the Cyprus Government to amend.
76. The Committee welcomes the State party's willingness to develop public awareness of and information on human rights.
In this regard, the Committee recommends that the Government consider undertaking measures to disseminate to the general public information concerning the Convention and the work of the Committee.
It welcomes the fact that the report to the Committee was publicized and invites the Government of Cyprus to give maximum publicity to the concluding observations of the Committee.
Italy
77. The eighth and ninth periodic reports of Italy (CERD/C/237/Add.1) were considered by the Committee at its 1075th to 1077th meetings, on 1 and 2 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1075-1077).
78. The report was introduced by the representative of the State party who stated that his country attached particular importance to all problems concerning discrimination and intolerance.
However, he noted that events that could amount to intolerance had occurred in areas where there was a particularly high concentration of foreigners from countries outside Europe, mostly from North Africa.
He noted the importance, during recent years, of persons migrating, de facto or de jure, into Italy, especially from North Africa and Eastern European countries.
In the case of displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia, he made reference to a special law which gave them the opportunity to enter Italy, at least temporarily, and to be provided with housing, food, education and so on.
79. The representative also made reference to the monitoring of the problem of nomads, in particular to facilities with regard to the schooling of children and other social action programmes.
He emphasized that Italy had deemed it appropriate to take a step forward in its action to prevent and punish any form of racism, intolerance and xenophobia by adopting Act No. 205, criminalizing the mere act of incitement to discrimination and expanding the content of the term "racial discrimination".
This new legislation had made it possible for the judiciary and the police to take action against neo-Nazi organizations.
The representative indicated that the Ministry of Education recently reminded local authorities of the need to intensify efforts to achieve inter-cultural education in schools at all levels.
80. Members of the Committee welcomed the detailed information given in the report and orally, but they noted that the report concentrated on legal provisions; it failed to provide information on the nature of the problems or to supply practical examples showing the implementation of laws and policies.
They asked the representative whether non-governmental organizations were involved in the preparation of periodic reports and whether the Committee's concluding observations were given any publicity.
81. With reference to article 2 of the Convention, members of the Committee wished to receive information about the effectiveness of the new provisions described in paragraphs 7 to 15 of the report.
They also wished to receive precise information on the extreme right-wing groups and gangs of "skinheads" referred to in the report; whether they had links with political parties; whether they attracted young people; what penalties were imposed on those groups through the new Act No. 205 of 25 June 1993 and what follow-up there had been by the police and the courts to the reported incidents of violence against foreigners.
They expressed satisfaction for the special status given to three regions inhabited by persons speaking minority languages, and asked for information on the status of other linguistic minorities elsewhere in Italy.
They also asked for more information about specific cases of racial violence in the recent past, particularly against Romas, Jews and people from North Africa.
In addition, they asked the representative to provide the Committee with information on the demographic composition of the Italian population, with specific reference to ethnic minorities, including the Roma community; on racist incidents and on social indicators, which included the crime rate and the rates of imprisonment, alcoholism, drug use and trafficking, prostitution, suicide and certain diseases, especially AIDS, for various groups, such as foreign nationals and migrant workers.
82. With regard to article 4 of the Convention, members wanted to know whether the laws referred to in the report, in particular Decree-Law No. 122, had been fully implemented; whether individuals or groups had been prosecuted under those laws; whether the provisions described covered all aspects of racial discrimination referred to in article 4 of the Convention and whether revisionism was a crime in Italy.
They also wanted to know whether consideration was given by his Government to withdrawing the reservation made to article 4 of the Convention.
83. Concerning article 5 of the Convention, members wished to know whether there was any surveillance of police operations; what action was taken in respect of the victims of racial discrimination by the police and whether those responsible for discrimination were retrained or disciplined.
They asked whether the legislation concerning political asylum for non-European Union citizens (Act No. 39 of February 1990) was more restrictive in matters relating to the status and employment of the people concerned than the ordinary Italian legislation in those areas and whether there were plans to amend this Act; they asked about the results of the campaign to get non-European Union citizens to renew their residence permits and whether there was any discrimination against migrant workers in the workplace and in housing.
They would have liked information on the regulations governing the deportation of aliens; on statistics about the number and nationality of aliens deported in recent years, and where they had been sent; on people refused admission to Italy on the grounds of public order; on the number of people granted political asylum in Italy and their countries of origin; on the number of people currently living in centres for immigrants and in "reception facilities", on the conditions in those centres and facilities and on the possibility for courts, foreigners' associations or interested non-governmental organizations to have access to them in order to monitor conditions there, and whether special arrangements were made for Albanians and refugees from the former Yugoslavia.
They also asked for information on the council for the problems of non-European Union workers and their families, on the way immigrants' representatives were chosen, and on the existence of any special agreement between the State and the Muslim community comparable to that between the State and the Jewish community.
84. With regard to article 6 of the Convention, members of the Committee regretted that there seemed to have been no developments in the individual's right to seek redress before the courts for acts of racial discrimination; in that connection, they asked for details and statistics on complaints, prosecutions and convictions in cases of acts of racism of all kinds.
With regard to the reservation made by Italy to article 6 of the Convention, members asked whether consideration was given to its withdrawal.
85. Concerning article 7 of the Convention, members asked for more information about measures taken to promote inter-cultural and multiracial education; on the integration of foreign pupils into Italian schools in practice and on the number of pupils, including those from non-European Union countries, receiving education on an individual or small-group basis.
86. In their reply, the representatives of Italy said that a procedure for the withdrawal of Italy's reservations to the Convention had been set in motion.
All the statistical information which members had requested would be provided later in writing.
However, they were able to state that, according to the local authorities and some non-governmental organizations, there had been about 300,000 illegal residents in Italy at the end of 1994.
The 1990 Martelli Act had changed the regulations governing immigrants by enabling the authorities to set a yearly limit on the number of aliens who would be allowed to immigrate into Italy, with the figure being published each year in a decree.
That Act had also provided for a national council and regional councils of representatives of workers from non-European Union countries appointed directly by non-Union workers' associations.
The membership of those councils reflected the size of the various communities in each area.
Some regions had laws encouraging the formation of non-Union workers' associations by granting subsidies.
Illegal immigration continued to be a major social problem in Italy, but was difficult to monitor or eradicate.
87. On the question of reception centres, a distinction should be drawn between foreign nationals applying for refugee status and non-European Union workers.
The former were permitted to stay for 45 days, pending the authorities' decision regarding their admission, and the latter were accommodated in primary reception centres set up in each region and subsidized by the State.
They therefore had housing and health care and enjoyed freedom of movement. It was difficult to determine their exact number, as the centres were merely transit facilities.
With regard to housing, a number of voluntary organizations acted as intermediaries between owners and foreign workers by acting as guarantors for the latter.
Some local authorities reserved a portion of their public housing for foreign workers and their families and, in some cases, the State and local authorities made abandoned buildings available to immigrant communities, with the sole proviso that they renovate them.
88. Between 1991 and 1993, some 100 court actions had been instituted against persons responsible for acts of racial discrimination.
In 20 cases, proceedings had been discontinued and in 20 others, sentences had been handed down.
It should be noted, however, that those figures were incomplete as, in cases where an act of discrimination was associated with another crime or offence, it was often the latter which was the basis for the court's decision.
Moreover, the measures associated with the new Act No. 205 of 25 June 1993 empowered the courts to impose penalties including the performance of community service.
With regard to the number of racially motivated incidents, three or four serious incidents involving criminal acts directed against the Roma community had taken place near Rome and two others near Bologna in which two members of the Roma community had died; a Roma encampment near Caseta had also been destroyed in a fire which had been deliberately set, resulting in charges being brought against 29 persons.
Anti-semitic acts included three or four cases of desecration of Jewish cemeteries, for which a number of individuals had been prosecuted.
89. The representative of Italy said that, concerning the ban on organizations linked with Fascist ideology, a number of those organizations had been banned under a 1952 law, including the Ordine Nuovo and Fronte Celtico, and that some extreme right-wing or "skinhead" groups had been banned under Decree-Law No. 122 of 1993, including the Movimento Politico Occidentale in Rome and the Front Nazionale in Verona.
Two groups of judges in Rome were concentrating on incidents of racial discrimination: one dealt with minority issues and the other with violent and politically linked incidents of xenophobia, racism and intolerance.
90. On the question of detention, there was no discrimination in law regarding the application of prison regulations; the prison authorities had attempted to remedy the language problem by providing excerpts from the regulations in foreign languages and offering Italian language courses.
Measures had been taken to remove obstacles to the exercise of religious freedom in prisons.
The prison authorities had facilitated the formation of a national organization to look into the question of foreign prisoners.
91. With regard to expulsions, under the Act of 12 August 1993, foreign nationals in pre-trial detention for offences not considered serious, or persons sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years were expelled immediately at their request or the request of their attorneys and were sent back to their country of origin or departure, provided they had no serious health problems or were not in danger for reasons related to war or an epidemic.
Generally speaking, there were two expulsion procedures: expulsion orders, whereby the authorities gave notice to leave the country within 15 days and the person concerned could appeal to the local administrative tribunal (in 1994, only 6,000 of 56,000 expulsion orders issued had actually been carried out), and escort to the frontier in the case of persons guilty of very serious crimes or whose situation was highly irregular.
92. In connection with questions related to special agreements with the Muslim community in Italy, the representatives said that the Muslims had no supreme national authority, like that of Jews or Seventh Day Adventists, with which such an agreement could be concluded; however, there had been agreements between Italian authorities and Muslim communities at the local level.
93. At its 1096th meeting, held on 16 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
94. The Committee welcomes the opportunity to continue its regular dialogue with the Italian Government.
It expresses its satisfaction at the presence of a large delegation, consisting mainly of officials of the various ministries concerned with the protection of human rights.
Nevertheless, some questions remained unanswered.
95. It is noted with satisfaction that Italy is one of the States parties which has made the declaration under article 14 of the Convention and that it has in practice abandoned its reservations to the Convention and instituted a procedure for their formal withdrawal.
96. It is also noted that Italy grants special status, guaranteed under the Constitution, to some linguistic or ethnic minorities in the Trento-Alto Adige, Friuli-Veneto Giulia and Valle d'Aosta regions.
97. The establishment of national and regional councils for the problems of non-Community workers and their families is noted with interest.
Positive measures have also been taken for the regularization, vocational training and health care of non-Community foreigners, as well as for the prevention of illegal employment.
98. The introduction of some new measures to combat the resurgence of racial violence is noted with satisfaction. These measures included Act No. 2061/C of 1992, instituting urgent measures on racial, ethnic and religious discrimination and, with regard to the right of asylum, the adoption of Act No. 39-90 of 1990, instituting urgent measures on political asylum, entry, residence and regularization of non-Community citizens and stateless persons.
99. New measures concerning inter-cultural education are also noted with satisfaction.
They include additional hours of instruction for pupils experiencing problems, most of whom are pupils of foreign origin confronted with the language barrier, and the ministerial circular on the equal distribution of foreign pupils in classes to promote their social integration.
100. Concerns are expressed about the manifestations of racism and xenophobia which seem to be on the rise in Italy, as in many other countries.
One of the subjects of concern in this regard is the high proportion of young people in extremist groups involved in acts of racial violence and the support they are apparently able to secure from some political circles.
101. Concerns are expressed about some cases involving the ill-treatment of foreigners of non-Community origin by police officers and prison staff.
102. Concern is also expressed regarding the social trends towards segregation in housing and work.
103. Regret is also expressed regarding the limited amount of information in the first general part of the report and the absence of details on the practical implementation of articles 2 to 6 of the Convention.
104. The Committee recommends that the Italian authorities urgently make more effective the measures to curb racial violence and xenophobia in all their forms.
105. The Committee expects the Italian Government, in its next periodic report, to provide fuller information on the first general part and on the implementation of the provisions of the Convention, notably articles 2 to 6.
106. Emphasizing the decisive role of the justice system in eliminating racial discrimination, the Committee asks to be provided with information on the effectiveness of remedies in cases of racial discrimination, on the number and content of complaints of racial or racially motivated offences, and on the judicial action taken on those complaints and the redress or compensation awarded to the victims.
107. The Committee requests further information on the actual operation of reception centres for foreigners and refugees at frontiers, on the control exercised over those centres by the judicial authorities and on the extent to which refugee assistance associations and organizations are permitted access to them.
108. The Committee would also like, in future, to be provided with full and up-to-date data on the composition of the population, on the "social indicators" of non-integration of the least favoured social groups of the population, on migratory flows and on the number of foreigners expelled.
109. Finally, the Committee draws the State party's attention to the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, approved at the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties and by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/111 of 16 December 1992, and invites it to consider taking measures necessary for the official acceptance of the amendment.
Sri Lanka
110. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of Sri Lanka, submitted in one document (CERD/C/234/Add.1) were considered by the Committee at its 1079th and 1080th meetings, held on 3 and 6 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1079-1080).
111. The report was introduced by the representative of the State party who expressed confidence in the constructive dialogue between his country, the Committee and other United Nations human rights mechanisms.
He drew particular attention to a recent major constitutional change whereby administrative power had been devolved to provincial councils in response to the demands of minorities, and Tamil had been made an official language.
112. The representative described the work and powers of the Official Languages Commission, established in 1991, which monitored compliance with the constitutional provisions concerning language and recommended policy concerning official languages.
Problems concerning minorities were also being addressed through initiatives in the field of employment.
Further to recommendations of the Youth Commission, there was now a policy of positive discrimination to redress under-representation of minority ethnic groups in the public service, subject to restrictions laid down by the Supreme Court.
Developments in promoting human rights education in schools, universities and professional courses were also described.
113. The representative stated that considerable progress in promoting human rights had occurred following a change of Government in 1994.
A range of measures to promote peace in the northern part of the country were described, including a ceasefire and peace negotiations with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), consideration of devolution options for minority groups in the region and rehabilitation projects.
He also noted that the Government had established a Ministry of Ethnic Affairs and National Integration and would soon put before Parliament a proposal to establish a national Human Rights Commission.
The representative presented to the Committee a document entitled, "Sri Lanka - Human Rights", which outlined his country's action in the field of human rights since the submission of the sixth periodic report.
114. The members of the Committee commended the State party on the quality of its report, prepared in accordance with the Committee's guidelines, and thanked the representative for the information provided orally.
Measures taken by the Government to find a political solution to problems in the northern and eastern provinces were welcomed as were the recent constitutional and legislative changes and the establishment of the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs and National Integration.
Members expressed approval for the increased promotion of human rights education in the country and the expressed willingness of the Government to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms and institutions.
115. Concerning article 2 of the Convention, members put a number of questions about the 1978 Constitution and the extent to which its provisions could be suspended in times of emergency.
Clarifications were also requested as to its compatibility with international law and the status of international human rights law in the national legal system.
Members requested information on the operation of emergency legislation and the proposed national Human Rights Commission.
Information was requested as to whether, in its efforts to combat discrimination within the terms of article 1 of the Convention, the Government was considering ratification of relevant ILO conventions and Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.
116. Concerning article 4, further information was requested regarding the practical application of the criminal law provisions concerning prosecution of manifestations of racial and religious hatred.
Members also expressed unease as to the effectiveness of those provisions and the fact that they did not address acts of hatred other than those which are racial or religious.
117. In discussing implementation of article 5, a number of members drew particular attention to the situation of the Tamil, Sinhalese and other communities.
More information was requested on matters including freedom of movement between the mainland and the Jaffna peninsula and elsewhere, the role of the army and the extent to which it might impede national reconciliation, the reports of the ongoing practice of torture by the security forces and the work of the Presidential Commission investigating abductions and disappearances.
A member asked about the fate of some 4,000 to 5,000 Sinhalese who the Government stated in 1991 were to be detained for life.
Information was requested on the status of some 85,000 stateless Tamils of Indian origin currently in the country.
118. Other matters queried in terms of article 5 were the treatment of workers, notably women in free trade zones, trade union freedoms and equal employment opportunities.
A member queried the extent to which ethnic quotas were or might be employed to select from among candidates for government posts, with reference, inter alia, to the information in the report that Muslims were allotted 8 per cent of such posts.
119. Concerning implementation of article 6 members asked for further information on the work of the commissions set up to examine cases of bribery and corruption, disappearances and political murders as well as on the extent of protection provided to those who had been threatened for taking legal action against the State in matters concerning alleged abuse of human rights.
Further information was also requested on the effectiveness of legal remedies for violations of rights protected by the Convention and on the role and activities of the ombudsman.
Some members expressed concern as to the extent to which the variety of human rights monitoring and redress bodies might overlap or effectively hinder one another in the carrying out of their activities.
120. The representative of the State party in commencing his replies expressed satisfaction with the dialogue with the Committee and gave assurances that matters not dealt with orally would receive consideration in his country's next report.
121. The representative explained the security exigencies which had prevented the holding of a national census and gave details of the new constitutional reforms, including the strengthening of human rights guarantees.
He emphasized that the changes would restrict the possibility of limiting a range of rights other than for purposes of maintaining public order.
The representative clarified that the policy of the State was to ensure compatibility of national laws with international standards prior to adhesion to the international instruments.
122. The state of emergency declared for the entire country on 24 October 1994 was still in effect in certain regions.
123. The representative provided information to the effect that many of the detainees referred to by members had now been released and that there was an ongoing inquiry which made recommendations on release and conditions of detention.
The Government would, he stated, take all necessary action to halt and punish violations of human rights.
124. The representative described in some detail the mandate and composition of the proposed national Human Rights Commission and indicated that its reports would be put regularly before Parliament.
125. In response to the questions of a member the representative explained the reasons for restricted freedom of movement between the mainland and the Jaffna peninsula and expressed his Government's determination to improve the situation.
126. Clarifications were given concerning the nature of the Muslim and Tamil communities and on consultations with Muslim communities in matters concerning their welfare.
127. The representative contended that the number of disappeared persons in the country was considerably less than the number of 60,000 mentioned by a member.
He described government policy concerning the future role of the armed forces and ongoing programmes of human rights education for troops.
Also described were strategies to care for and bring about the return of displaced people.
Other institutional initiatives to redress human rights problems included the human rights task force, the independent commission on corruption, the Centre for the Independence of Magistrates and Advocates, implementation of recommendations of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Involuntary Disappearances, the Ombudsman, etc.
The role of the Supreme Court was described.
128. The representative denied that religious freedom, freedom of expression or trade union and employment rights were limited in a manner inconsistent with the Convention.
129. In conclusion, the representative presented figures on the ethnic composition of the public service and its recruitment policy.
130. At its 1094th meeting, held on 15 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
131. The Committee commends the State party on the quality of its report prepared in accordance with the Committee's guidelines for the preparation of State party reports and expresses its appreciation to the State party's delegation for additional information that it provided to the Committee orally.
It notes with satisfaction the submission by Sri Lanka of the core document (HRI/CORE/1/Add.48) and of the document entitled "Sri Lanka - Human Rights" containing information of a general character.
The Committee regrets, however, that the third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports have not been submitted on time and that the report under consideration combines the third to sixth reports and covers a period of almost 10 years.
132. Measures adopted by the People's Alliance Government of Sri Lanka with a view to finding a political solution to the problems affecting the northern and eastern provinces are welcomed.
Those measures, particularly the commencing of negotiations with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the elaboration of the rehabilitation projects of some US$ 800 million for the northern province, and the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement with LTTE which came into effect on 8 January 1995 pave the way to national integration and to the promotion of national reconciliation between all communities of the Sri Lankan society.
133. Also welcomed are legislative and administrative measures recently adopted by the Government with a view to fostering and consolidating the process of peaceful resolution of the conflict situation prevailing in the country during the period under review.
Among measures noted are the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution providing, inter alia, for the creation of the mechanism of provincial councils to satisfy minority demands and for the introduction of Tamil as an official language in addition to the Sinhalese language, with English as the link language; the amendments to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Act No. 17 of 1981 simplifying the procedure for submission and consideration of complaints; the creation of the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs and National Integration; and the announced establishment of a national Human Rights Commission which would be yet another forum through which the minorities could seek redress of their grievances.
134. Noted with satisfaction are measures taken by the Government to disseminate knowledge of human rights among the various segments of the national community by, inter alia, the incorporation of human rights concepts into school curricula; training in human rights provided for law enforcement officials; and introduction of human rights as a subject in undergraduate and postgraduate university studies.
135. The readiness of the Government of Sri Lanka to cooperate with various United Nations human rights monitoring mechanisms and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and institutions in the domain of human rights protection is appreciated.
(c) Factors and difficulties impeding the application of the Convention
136. It is noted that the situation prevailing in the country during the period under review has not been conducive to the effective implementation of the Convention and has made it difficult for the State party to comply with its reporting obligations, thus preventing the Committee from fulfilling its obligations in accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the Convention.
(d) Principal subjects of concern
137. It is noted with concern that the state of emergency in effect intermittently since 1983 continues in a significant part of the national territory.
The Committee hopes that the situation will improve so that the state of emergency can be lifted.
138. Concern is expressed that the State party has not provided sufficient information on the implementation of the provisions contained in articles 4 and 5 of the Convention.
(e) Suggestions and recommendations
139. The Committee draws the State party's attention to the obligation under article 9 of the Convention to report regularly and that the seventh report, due on 20 March 1995, be submitted without delay.
140. The Committee recommends that the State party pay more attention to sensitizing the members of the law enforcement agencies, security and armed forces about human rights.
141. The Committee also recommends that the State party, in its seventh periodic report, provide more detailed information on the system of human rights organs functioning in the country, and in particular on how their mandates relate to the rights mentioned in the Convention; information on how these organs interact and coordinate their activities is also requested.
142. It is recommended that the Government provide the Committee with the information necessary to assess its implementation of articles 4 (b) and 5 (e) of the Convention.
The Government is reminded that it should adopt specific penal legislation in accordance with General Recommendation 15.
Croatia
143. The Committee, in concluding observations adopted at the forty-third session,5/ requested additional information from Croatia concerning measures taken to give effect to the provisions of the Convention.
The Committee considered the additional information (CERD/C/249/Add.1) at its 1087th and 1088th meetings, held on 9 and 10 March 1995, respectively (see CERD/C/SR.1087-1088).
144. The representative of the State party in presenting the additional information noted that some of the Committee's previous queries had been rendered obsolete by time and others had become more pressing.
As a source of background information he distributed copies of a text entitled "Human rights in Croatia".
He noted the importance of the mission to his country by a member of the Committee and further drew attention to findings of the Council of Europe concerning the human rights situation in Croatia.
145. Attention was drawn to the important human rights safeguards contained in the Constitution and the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities.
The representative explained that a provision queried earlier by the Committee, in which it seemed that the Supreme Court appointed members of the Parliament, was actually a constitutionally valid act of affirmative action to ensure parliamentary representation of Serbs.
146. With regard to implementation of human rights safeguards the representative noted the enormous problems posed by the ongoing war and occupation of parts of the national territory by secessionist forces.
Even in areas away from conflict zones the war caused major economic problems and presented the challenge of caring for enormous numbers of displaced persons (who constitute some 8 per cent of the Croatian population).
147. The representative assured the Committee that following the war there would be no reprisals or discriminatory actions taken against Serbian people and that they would enjoy full respect for their human rights.
He affirmed the commitment of Croatia to support the work of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (the International Tribunal), and in general to bring violators of human rights to justice.
148. The representative acknowledged that there were isolated incidents in Croatia of expressions of racial hatred; however, the Government was reluctant to limit freedom of expression, in reaction not least to the decades of repressive communist rule.
149. With regard to article 2 of the Convention a number of members expressed concern about the Government of Croatia's expressed intention to end the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force and the implications of such action for the security of minorities in various parts of the country.
Questions were asked concerning the extent to which the Government would cooperate with the work of the International Tribunal in bringing war criminals to justice.
Also, members wished to know the extent of prosecutions undertaken in the country for acts of racial discrimination and sought information on the activities of the various State bodies charged with protecting the rights of minority groups.
150. Members wished to know the situation of various minority groups, including Roma gypsies and those of Serb or Italian origin.
151. Members expressed concern that Croatian law and government policy seemed to fail to comply with the terms of article 4 of the Convention and they requested clarifications in this regard.
152. Pursuant to the terms of article 5 of the Convention, members expressed concern about the situation of large numbers of displaced people, mostly of the Muslim religion, who had sought shelter in Croatia consequent upon war conditions in the Bihac area of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The plight of other refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina was also mentioned and reference was made to indications of possibly discriminatory criteria for the granting of refugee status.
With regard to the granting of nationality, Members inquired about possibly discriminatory policies militating against people of the Muslim faith or of Serb origin.
153. Members inquired about the Government's efforts to protect the Serb minority and drew attention, inter alia, to reports of illegal evictions which the State had failed to prevent.
The Government was also asked to comment on allegations of human rights abuses against Roma gypsies.
154. With regard to human rights abuses and violations of the Convention in areas under the de facto control of secessionist forces, members inquired as to what Croatia was doing to bring about a peaceful reintegration of the territories and to assist in the quest for missing persons.
155. Concerning article 6 of the Convention, members asked about allegations that people of Serb origin and Roma gypsies had great difficulty in obtaining justice in the courts.
Enquiries were also made as to the effectiveness of the judicial system in processing complaints of human rights abuses and the extent to which courts have been seized of such matters.
156. Pursuant to article 7 of the Convention, members wished to know what human rights training was provided for members of the security forces.
157. It was asked whether the Government would consider accepting the right of individual petition under article 14 of the Convention.
158. In replying to the members the representative reaffirmed his Government's commitment to human rights but noted the extreme difficulties presented by the war situation and the exigencies of putting in place the apparatus of a modern democracy.
Further details were provided on the various State institutions charged with protection of human rights, and the role played by the Council of Europe.
The status of the Convention in national law was clarified; any failure to cite it in court was probably attributable to a lack of awareness on the part of lawyers.
159. With regard to the International Tribunal and the initiatives of the United Nations to trace missing persons, the complete support of Croatia was reaffirmed and the manner of cooperation was explained.
Also, the representative presented the rationale behind Croatia's policy with regard to the United Nations Protection Force.
160. The representative explained that the Government was endeavouring to fully respect the rights of all minority groups, including Roma gypsies and those of Serb, Italian and Albanian origin, and of displaced people, and was to the extent possible extending to them all the social and educational support of the State.
Furthermore, the wishes of the various groups were fully taken into account in the development of government policy.
Expulsions of displaced people and decisions on citizenship were in full conformity with the law (which is, however, currently being reviewed).
161. A range of the specific points raised by members was addressed by the representative.
Croatian law and policy endeavoured to protect human rights, but in a number of instances, such as the freedom of the media, the Government might modify the current position.
162. The representative stated that the Government was anxious to respect the rights of people resident in areas under the de facto control of secessionist forces and was actively pursuing a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
It was noted that recent agreements with the rebel forces had brought some improvement to the quality of life of residents of the areas.
163. At its 1096th meeting, held on 16 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
164. The opportunity to continue the constructive dialogue with the State party is welcomed and appreciation is expressed concerning the readiness of the State party to provide the additional information which had been requested by the Committee.
The presence of a high-level delegation and the extent to which it presented additional information orally and in written form to the Committee is indicative of the desire of the State party to take seriously its obligations under the Convention.
Also acknowledged with appreciation is the invitation and assistance offered to the Committee's good-offices mission to Croatia which took place in 1994.
165. The stated commitment to normalize inter-ethnic relations is welcomed as are the advances which have been made in democratic institution-building.
The establishment of a Constitutional Court is especially important and ongoing preparations for the activation of bodies such as a provisional court of human rights are noted.
Satisfaction is expressed concerning the adherence of Croatia to the Council of Europe's human rights protection mechanism for non-members.
The State party is to be commended for its willingness to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and with mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights, including the special process for disappeared persons and the Special Rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia.
(c) Factors and difficulties
166. It is deplored that the State party, due to the fact that parts of its territory are controlled by secessionist forces, is not in a position to exercise control over the whole of its territory and in consequence cannot ensure the application of the provisions of the Convention throughout the State.
It is noted that the secessionist forces are responsible for systematic violations of human rights in areas under their de facto control, including rights ensured by the Convention, the principal victims of which are those not belonging to the Serb or Croatian Serb communities.
167. The enormous problems for the State party posed by the effects of the hostilities in the former Yugoslavia are noted. In particular the difficulties in meeting the needs of the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons are acknowledged.
168. Great concern has been expressed about the earlier intention of the State party not to permit the military, civilian and police components of the United Nations Protection Force to remain in the country.
It is considered that withdrawal may have the gravest implications for minority ethnic groups and displaced persons in the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs), the demilitarized zone and elsewhere.
169. While recognizing the considerable problems confronted by the State party in meeting the needs of refugees and displaced persons, unease is expressed as to recent practices which have particularly affected refugees of Bosnian Muslim origin.
Note is taken of reliable reports that many such refugees have failed or had great difficulty and extreme delay in obtaining the necessary documentation to allow them access to essential social and humanitarian services in Croatia, and have thus been obliged to return to sometimes life-threatening situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Concern is also expressed about the incident in late summer of 1994 when the State party refused to allow some 30,000 externally displaced persons, all Bosnian Muslims, from the Velika Kladusa region of Bihac (Bosnia and Herzegovina) to leave appalling camp conditions in UNPA North and the demilitarized zone and enter areas of Croatia under its control.
It is, however, noted that the situation was especially complicated by, inter alia, the influence exerted by leaders of the so-called "Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia", the rapidly changing war situation and the eventual return of most of the displaced people to Velika Kladusa.
170. It is noted that the administration of the criminal justice system fails adequately to address crimes of an ethnic nature.
Thus there has been a failure to prosecute alleged perpetrators of crimes directed at ethnic Serbs and it is reliably reported that a number of Croatian Serbs have been unfairly prosecuted or excessively punished for alleged crimes against non-Serbs.
171. Attention is drawn to the extent of evictions carried out by State authorities against ethnic Serb residents of apartments formerly owned by the Yugoslav National Army. Particular concern is expressed regarding evictions which the Government declared to be legal in apparent defiance of decisions of the Constitutional Court.
Inaction by the government authorities to prevent or reverse evictions of ethnic Serbs which it itself deems to be illegal is also noted.
172. Concern is expressed regarding the influence of the mass media in aggravating ethnic tension and the failure of the State to investigate and prosecute a number of incidents of promotion by elements of the print media of hatred directed against ethnic Serbs.
173. Note is taken of the provisions of the laws concerning naturalization and acquisition of citizenship and concern is expressed as to the great difficulties encountered in the process by many who are not of ethnic Croat origin.
174. Attention is drawn to the situation of the Roma community in Croatia and to a number of reports indicating that they are subject to discrimination and forms of harassment.
175. The Committee recommends that the process of democratic institution-building proceed with great urgency and that the provisional court of human rights speedily commence its activities.
It also recommends that the State party ensure that laws and regulations concerning, inter alia, naturalization, acquisition of citizenship, determination of refugee status and tenure of rented accommodation be implemented in a transparent non-discriminatory manner in full conformity with the provisions of the Convention.
It further recommends that any victims of discriminatory application of such rules and regulations in violation of the terms of the Convention receive redress to the extent that this is possible.
176. The Committee recommends that the State party ensure that it administers justice in a manner consistent with its obligations under the Convention and that it speedily prosecute all alleged offences which appear to be directed against persons because of their racial, ethnic or religious origins.
It recommends to the State party that it identify any miscarriages of justice which may have occurred and been motivated by the ethnic origin of the defendants and that it redress any injustice done.
177. The Committee recommends that the State party consider making the declaration under article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention.*
178. The Committee recommends as a matter of urgency that the State party comply with article 4 of the Convention and prohibit and prosecute all incitement to ethnic hatred in the media and elsewhere.
180. The reports were introduced by the representative of the State party, who indicated that the Government of Peru, democratically elected in 1990, had worked hard to rebuild the economy and combat terrorism and drug-trafficking.
While the process of national peace-building was not yet complete, the Government had succeeded in disbanding many terrorist organizations, thanks to its - necessarily strict - anti-terrorist legislation, which was now being progressively relaxed.
The international bodies concerned with human rights had acknowledged the sharp fall in the number of allegations of violation of human rights in Peru.
The new Constitution had been adopted in 1993 and endorsed by the people in a referendum.
The Constitution stated that all persons were equal before the law and expressly prohibited discrimination on the grounds of origin, race or language.
The Government had drawn up a preliminary draft of a law which would cite acts of racial discrimination as aggravating factors in offences already described in the existing criminal law, thus reflecting the provisions of article 4 of the Convention.
181. The representative said that any discussion of racial problems in Peru must necessarily refer to the situation of the indigenous communities.
Peru was the most ethnically varied country in South America, with no less than 14 different families of languages.
Indigenous communities enjoyed a whole range of rights and prerogatives which protected their existence as legal entities and their autonomy in respect of organization, communal work and the free use of their lands.
The Constitution delegated many legal functions to the traditional indigenous authorities in accordance with customary law, provided that the fundamental rights of the individual were not infringed.
Other legislation and development projects dealing with indigenous communities were mentioned by the representative.
The Government, he said, had also given a high priority to education.
182. Members of the Committee welcomed the resumed dialogue with the reporting State and noted with satisfaction that the Government of Peru had ratified ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.
183. In connection with article 2 of the Convention, members of the Committee noted that the report failed to give a clear account of Peru's "national integration" policy. It made no mention of concrete measures, as required by the Convention, and was confined to general statements.
Statistics showed that public resources were concentrated in Lima, where the white population was mostly located, whereas the regions and departments with the largest indigenous populations were neglected, although the people were the poorest, the least educated and the least developed.
It was felt that, although economic and social policies in general might be successful in some ways, they often marginalized the rural poor, who in many cases were descendants of indigenous peoples, and thus had the effect of failing to guarantee their social and economic rights and increasing inequalities.
Members of the Committee wished to know to what extent there were policy consultations between the Government and non-governmental organizations, and whether there had been responses to their views on the question of national integration.
Regarding the status of the Black minority of Peru, members requested information as to what was done to redress the situation of pervasive discrimination, social prejudice and persistent poverty.
184. Members of the Committee observed that very little information had been provided concerning the implementation of article 4 of the Convention. In particular, it was not clear whether article 371 of the Peruvian Penal Code met the standards of article 4 of the Convention.
185. With regard to the implementation of article 5 of the Convention, more information was needed on the extent to which the measures described in the report were effective.
In particular, regret was expressed at the lack of any information in the report on the protection from racial discrimination of the right to housing, provided for under article 5 (e) (iii) of the Convention.
Referring to the right to equal participation in cultural activities, established in article 5 (e) (vi), and in particular to the mass media, it was asked whether there was any consultation with multiracial, integrationist associations to ascertain their views concerning representation in the media.
Referring to the statement that Quechua, Aymara and the other aboriginal languages had official status under the law, members of the Committee asked whether interpretation was, as required, provided in the courts, how many people spoke those languages and whether translations into those languages had been made of various legislative documents, notably those relating to labour law and the rules governing detention, release from detention and sentencing.
Concerning possible violations of the rights enumerated in article 5 of the Convention and the right of individual recourse, consequent to Peru's declaration under article 14, to the help of international bodies such as the Committee when domestic remedies had been exhausted, members of the Committee asked whether people in general were in fact aware of their rights, of the constitutional guarantees that protected them, and of the remedies available to them if they suffered discrimination.
Concerning the ancestral peasant and indigenous communities' right of ownership to their lands, mentioned in the report, it was asked to what extent those communities were actual participants in or beneficiaries of programmes for the exploitation and development of natural resources in those lands.
Further information was also requested on the customary courts authorized by the Constitution and on the relationship between those special courts and the regular justice system.
Members of the Committee asked how the New Criminal Code was organized, and what arrangements there were for persons who, because of their ethnic background, were unable to understand the regular legal procedures.
186. As to article 6 of the Convention, members of the Committee recognized that many remedies were available, but they wished to know to what extent they were effectively used and how expensive it was for a person who had suffered discrimination to take advantage of those remedies.
Commending Peru's acceptance of the individual complaints procedure under article 14, they asked whether some research could be carried out in order to ascertain the extent to which people were aware of the recourse procedures available to them.
More information was also needed on the working of the court system and its expected restructuring.
Members of the Committee noted that it would have been appreciated if some significant examples of complaints, prosecution and convictions for acts of racial discrimination had been given.
It was emphasized that actual complaints were a measure of public confidence in the legal system and that actual prosecutions and sentences were the yardstick whereby the effective application of the Convention could be gauged.
Where racial discrimination was concerned, evidence of judicial intervention, including repressive measures, had a symbolic and even pedagogic function in society at large.
On the contrary, there was a substantial body of evidence from sources, including the Human Rights Committee, that much violence affecting peasant and indigenous groups was being committed in Peru by the military, the paramilitary, the police and armed Government-controlled groups, in a persistent pattern of impunity.
187. Replying to the questions and comments of the Committee, the representative of the State party said that Peru's policy was one of integration, rather than of assimilation or destruction of values, and aimed to preserve the values and customs of local communities.
That policy took due account of the benefits of modern life, while taking care not to destroy indigenous culture, but to maintain contacts between it and with the rest of the country.
With regard to the ethnic composition of the population, he said that questions concerning ethnic or racial origin had not been included in the questionnaires used in the 1993 national census, since it was national policy not to emphasize racial differences.
He also informed members of the Committee that he would let them have a copy of the official ethno-linguistic map of Peru, which had been drawn up recently by the Instituto Indigenista Peruano, and that the results of the national census would also be communicated to them immediately after the present session.
As for the results of the other two major censuses, which had been respectively concerned with indigenous communities and the rural population, he said that the Government of Peru would transmit them to the Committee as soon as they were published.
188. In the area of education, the Government had launched an intercultural bilingual education programme (1995-2005) directed at indigenous communities throughout the country.
Sixty bilingual teachers were being trained, and they in turn would train 2,400 other teachers.
189. With regard to customary law, there were good reasons for protecting it, since it was made up of usages having force of law which played an effective regulatory role within the various groups in which it had originated.
On the other hand, the Penal Code took account of "errors of fact due to cultural conditioning" to allow judges to pass less severe sentences than would normally be incurred by individuals found guilty of particular offences who had acted in accordance with the principles of their own culture.
190. With regard to the issue of the political representation of indigenous people in the Parliament, he explained that it was neither required nor prohibited under the Constitution. Ethnic representation in the Parliament and in the Executive Branch took the most varied forms, as it did in the media, the press and radio and in all the country's activities.
191. With regard to the apparent conflict between the acknowledged property rights of peasant communities over their own land and the rights of the State, he said that article 69 of the Constitution, which stated that natural resources belonged to the State and was the basis for the national policy of maintaining biological diversity, was of a general nature.
The autonomy of communities in respect of their organization and the use and free disposal of their land was subject to the general principles established by law.
192. Turning to the issue of bilingualism in the courts, he said that under the terms of the new Constitution all accused persons were entitled to the services of an interpreter.
193. With regard to the question of statistics on complaints of discrimination, he noted that such complaints had for the last two years been entered on a national register.
Studies would be made of acts of racial discrimination and the relevant conclusions would be included in the next report.
194. At its 1095th meeting, held on 15 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
195. The Committee welcomes the submission by the State party of a detailed report, prepared in accordance with the Committee's revised guidelines for the preparation of reports, and the resumption of the dialogue with the Government of Peru nine years after the consideration by the Committee of the previous report.
The presence of a high-level delegation which provided additional information on most of the points raised by members of the Committee enables the Committee to obtain a better understanding of the efforts against racial discrimination in Peru, thus providing the basis for a frank and fruitful dialogue between the delegation and the Committee.
196. Measures recently adopted by the Government to improve the human rights situation are welcomed, as is continuing attention to the needs of indigenous communities.
Satisfaction is expressed at the recent ratification by the State party of ILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.
The Committee welcomes the additional information provided in the oral introduction of the report.
The Committee takes note and welcomes the offer made by the Minister of Justice to provide the Committee with additional information as soon as possible.
(c) Factors and difficulties affecting the implementation of the Convention
197. It is noted that, as a consequence of violence linked with terrorist groups' activities and drug-trafficking, the State party has serious difficulties in the implementation of some provisions of the Convention.
Structural problems such as the economic consequences of foreign debt have to be acknowledged.
198. It is regretted that the State party has failed, since the submission of its seventh periodic report, to comply with its reporting obligations, so it has not been possible for the Committee to monitor the effects of Peru's fight against racial discrimination.
It is further regretted that the Government failed to provide the Committee in its written report with accurate demographic data on Peru and that it did not contain sufficient information on the factual situation prevailing in Peru as far as protection against racial discrimination is concerned.
199. Concern is expressed that the socio-economic conditions of certain ethnic groups in Peru, particularly of indigenous communities living in rural areas and of indigenous, as well as Peruvians of non-European origin in urban society, remain disadvantageous compared to those of the white population in the urban areas.
It is further noted with concern that some effects of the economic and social policy of the Government threaten the enjoyment of the social and economic rights of persons belonging to indigenous communities.
Furthermore, the report fails to give a clear picture of the substance and implementation of the "national integration policy" or of the way legal provisions protecting "cultural identity" are implemented.
200. It is noted that articles 129 and 317 of the Criminal Code do not fully meet the requirements of article 4 of the Convention.
Concern is expressed about the lack of information contained in the State party's report on results of measures adopted to give effect to articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Convention.
201. As regards implementation of article 6, concern is expressed at the number of allegations of excessive use of violence committed in the past towards the rural population (most of whom are of indigenous descent) by the army and various armed groups as a reaction to terrorism.
The role of military courts in this respect needs further explanation and assessment.
The Committee is concerned whether impunity is not given too much weight in respect of the prosecution of human rights violations by military and paramilitary groups.
Concern is also expressed regarding the adequacy of publicity given to the right of individuals claiming to be victims of racial discrimination to appeal to the Committee under article 14 of the Convention.
202. The Committee recommends that further efforts be undertaken by the Government to put into practice the provisions of the Convention, as well as the legislative, judicial and administrative measures referred to in the State party's report.
The Committee also recommends that effective monitoring mechanisms be introduced to assess progress achieved in the protection of the rights of indigenous communities.
203. The Committee recommends that special efforts be made within the armed forces to terminate any unlawful violence towards civilians, including persons belonging to indigenous communities, and to secure that perpetrators of human rights violations are brought to justice.
204. The Committee requests the Government of Peru to provide, in its next report due on 30 October 1994, detailed information on the actual implementation of articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Convention.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
205. The Committee considered the report of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CERD/C/247/Add.1) at its 1082nd and 1092nd meetings, held on 7 and 14 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1082 and 1092).
206. At its 1082nd meeting the Committee proceeded in the absence of a representative of the State party.
Members drew attention to aspects of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, emphasizing the effects of the ongoing conflict and the activities of international bodies.
207. Some members called for the lifting of the international arms embargo on the export of arms to the State party, withdrawal of the United Nations Protection Force and more forceful action by the Security Council.
Such suggestions elicited debate.
208. A delegation of the State party attended the 1092nd meeting of the Committee.
The State representative expressed regret for the late submission of the report and the inability, by reason of war conditions, of representatives to attend earlier meetings in which his country was discussed.
209. The representative drew attention to the establishment of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the very strong human rights provisions contained therein in its Constitution, including the provision incorporating the Convention and other international instruments into the law of the Federation.
The representative also explained the envisioned roles for the ombudsmen and the Human Rights Court.
Support was expressed for the rule of law and for international procedures such as the International Tribunal for the prosecution of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
210. The representative described the terrible situation afflicting the country owing to the aggression of secessionist and external forces, whereby the Government was not in control of all its territory and was unable to halt massive violations of human rights in these areas.
211. Members of the Committee expressed appreciation for the presence of a high-level delegation from the State party and for the information provided both orally and in the report.
Understanding was expressed for the great difficulties which the war and Sarajevo siege placed on the State party in meeting its reporting obligations under the Convention.
212. A number of members requested further information on the legal structures in the Constitutions of the Republic and the Federation which serve to protect and vindicate human rights, such as the judicial system, including the proposed Human Rights Court, and procedures for prosecution of crimes against humanity whether domestically or before the International Tribunal.
The representative was also asked to indicate the extent to which ethnically motivated and other such crimes were in the course of being investigated and prosecuted.
213. Concerning the ongoing war, members asked for information as to the Government's understanding of the long-term political ambitions of the separatists and for its view on the effectiveness and utility of the United Nations Protection Force.
A member also asked for the views of the representative as to whether the conflict was essentially ethnically or politically based.
214. Members asked whether Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a pluralist State which rejected ethnic discrimination or preferment.
One member asked whether non-Muslims were treated equally to Muslims.
Further information was requested on the influence of the mass media and whether they had contributed to the promotion of ethnic hatred.
215. In replying to a range of questions posed, the representative of the State party reiterated his country's commitment to the rule of law and to the importance of the principles of human rights.
He stressed the culpability of aggressors who were attempting to dismember his country.
He and other members of the delegation presented their analysis of attempts to create a "Greater Serbia".
216. The important role played by the United Nations Protection Force was acknowledged, though representatives said that it was inadequate to meet the needs which should be addressed.
217. At its 1097th meeting, held on 16 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
218. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination acknowledges the report received from the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is profoundly distressed about the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law reported therein.
The Committee appreciates the presence of the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and takes note with appreciation of the information provided orally.
(b) Principal subjects of concern
219. The Committee expresses its grave concern and condemns the massive, gross and systematic human rights violations occurring in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of which are committed in connection with the systematic policy of "ethnic cleansing" and genocidal acts in the areas under the control of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb authorities.
All these practices, which are still occurring, constitute a grave violation of all the basic principles underlying the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
The Committee urges the immediate reversal of ethnic cleansing which must begin with the voluntary return of displaced people.
220. The Committee deeply regrets that no effective protection was afforded to the population even in the Security Council-declared "safe areas".
221. It is deeply deplored that due to the control of parts of its territory by secessionist forces with support from outside, the State party is not in a position to exercise control over the whole of its territory and consequently cannot ensure the application of the provisions of the Convention throughout the State.
It is noted that the secessionist forces are mainly responsible for systematic violations of human rights in areas under their de facto control, including rights ensured by the Convention, the principal victims of which are those belonging to the Muslim community.
The Committee, being aware of the inherent right to self-defence of all States, as recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, notes that the Government has been prevented from protecting human rights throughout its territory.
222. The Committee is deeply concerned about the threat to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina posed by the design for a "Greater Serbia".
(c) Suggestions and recommendations
223. The Committee reaffirms that persons responsible for massive, gross and systematic human rights violations and also crimes against international humanitarian law should be held responsible and prosecuted on the national or the international level.
224. While mindful of the complexities of the resort to enforcement action, as explained by the Secretary-General in the supplement to an Agenda for Peace (A/50/60-S/1995/1), the Committee expresses the view that the continuing and persistent violations of basic principles of international law and international obligations deriving therefrom, including basic principles underlying the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, calls for the application of enforcement measures by the Security Council in connection with the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
225. The Committee repeats its offer of technical assistance to the State party in the form of a mission of one or more of its members for the purpose of promoting the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
226. The Committee, in concluding observations adopted at the forty-third session, 6/ requested additional information from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) concerning measures taken to give effect to the provisions of the Convention.
The Committee considered the additional information, contained in document CERD/C/248/Add.1, at its 1094th meeting, held on 15 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1094).
227. Consideration of the additional information proceeded in the absence of a representative of the State party.
In that regard, the Committee had before it copies of an exchange of correspondence between the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Chairman of the Committee.
The text of those communications reads as follows:
Letter dated 15 February 1995 from the Charg√© d'affaires
a.i. of the Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the United Nations Office at Geneva to the
Chairman of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
With reference to the United Nations Secretary-General's note No. G/SO 237/2 (2) of 26 October 1994, and the invitation extended to the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 4 November 1994, for sending its representatives to a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, may I transmit herewith the following position of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia pointed out on several occasions its position that, being the continuation of the international, legal and political personality of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it would strictly abide by all the commitments the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had undertaken by acceding to international-legal instruments, which includes the obligations deriving from its membership in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
With regard to the fact that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was unlawfully denied the right to participate in the work of the latest meeting of the States parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, whereby the basic rights of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia deriving from its membership in the Convention have been violated, the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is of the view that the position of inequality, in which it is being placed by this act, makes its normal and usual cooperation with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination impossible.
Taking into account that, regrettably, in the meantime after our latest communication (No. 56/1 of 26 January 1995), nothing has been changed in the position held towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is, it is not yet considered as a full member to the Convention, the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is keeping its position and it will not participate at the above-mentioned Committee meeting.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is expecting that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be allowed to participate on the footing of equality at the next Conference of the States parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and that usual cooperation with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination will be resumed afterwards.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wishes to reiterate once again its sincere interest in the equitable dialogue with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which is of mutual interest.
Ambassador
Letter dated 6 March 1995 from the Chairman of the
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to the Charg√© d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the United Nations Office at Geneva
I refer to your letter of 15 February 1995 which transmits the position of your Government on the invitation extended to it to participate in the consideration by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of the additional information supplied by your Government pursuant to a request of the Committee.
May I convey to you the great regret of the Committee concerning the decision of your Government not to send a delegation to meet with it during its current session.
While the absence of a delegation does not preclude consideration of the information which has been supplied, it does, however, greatly hinder the process of dialogue.
The Committee considers that the continuation of the dialogue with your Government will contribute to the implementation of the Convention.
Note has been taken of the reasons presented by your Government as underlying its position.
In this regard the Committee would like to restate its view that it has always considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is duty-bound as a State party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and that the Committee, in its actions, will continue to proceed on the basis of this understanding.
It is the hope of the Committee that your Government will reconsider its decision in sufficient time to allow for a dialogue to occur during the present session.
228. Members welcomed the submission of the additional information while deploring the unwillingness of the State party to send a representative to participate in the Committee's deliberations.
Members also drew attention to and stressed the importance of the findings of fact contained in the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Mr. T. Mazowiecki.
A number of members condemned the apparent unwillingness of the State party to take seriously its international obligations concerning human rights or to cooperate with various international procedures which are intended to promote respect for the rights of all peoples and especially vulnerable minority groups.
229. With regard to articles 2 and 5 of the Convention attention was drawn to reports of patterns of discrimination perpetrated by the State party against a number of minority groups, including people of Albanian origin in the Kosovo region, people of the Muslim faith in Sandjak and those of Bulgarian origin in certain areas of Serbia.
Among the discriminatory practices cited were police harassment, deprivation of education rights, mass dismissals from employment and restrictions on freedom of expression.
It was also noted that the Government persisted in refusing to assist United Nations initiatives to trace disappeared persons or to cooperate with the International Tribunal since 1991.
230. The role of the communications media in promoting ethnic and religious hatred was stressed by members and attention was drawn in that regard to the findings of the Special Rapporteur, which clearly indicate systematic and grave violations of article 4 of the Convention.
231. Members expressed concern about apparent violations of article 6 arising from reports that members of minority groups were unable to obtain adequate redress for violations of their human rights perpetrated by government authorities or by private citizens in circumstances where the government authorities failed to take preventive action.
232. Members referred to the good offices mission of the Committee which had visited Kosovo in 1993 and some expressed the view that a further mission might serve to promote respect for the Convention in that region.
In general members indicated their wish to give the fullest possible appropriate support to the Albanian minority in that region.
233. At its 1097th meeting, held on 16 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
234. The submission of a detailed document containing the additional information requested from the State party is welcomed.
However, the Committee deplores the unwillingness of the State party to send a representative to participate in the consideration by the Committee of the information before it.
The Committee notes the disparity between the intentions stated by the State party in its additional information concerning cooperation with the Committee and its unwillingness to participate at the meeting.
235. The important role played by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission for Human Rights for the former Yugoslavia is acknowledged and his findings of fact are endorsed.
(b) Factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention
236. It is recognized that the State party is experiencing considerable economic difficulties which have a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights including those protected by the Convention.
It is also acknowledged that the country faces severe challenges in meeting the needs of the large number of refugees within its territory.
237. Great concern is expressed regarding the situation of the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo.
Reports continue to be received of campaigns of discrimination, harassment and, at times, terrorization, directed against them by State authorities.
Dismissals from jobs in the public sector, principally from the police and education services, continue.
Numerous reports have been received of physical attacks and robbery either committed by persons in the service of the State or inadequately investigated by the police.
It can be concluded that the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo continue to be deprived of effective enjoyment of the most basic human rights provided in the Convention.
238. Concern is expressed regarding ethnic discrimination against other groups including the Muslim community of Sandjak and the Bulgarian community in Serbia.
Note is taken of recent acts of discrimination perpetrated against these groups and of the failure of the State party to bring such actions to an end or to have them investigated and prosecuted.
239. Note is taken with profound concern of the large part which the media continue to play in the propagation of racial and ethnic hatred.
Given the very tight State control over the media this propagation of hatred may be attributed to the State.
It is further noted that the State party fails to take adequate action to either prosecute perpetrators of such acts or to attempt to redress injustices.
It also fails to take action to counter the propagation of prejudice against non-Serbians through education of the population in tolerance.
240. The failure of the State party to cooperate with the special process on disappearances of the Commission on Human Rights is deplored.
It is noted that without this cooperation no progress can be made in establishing the fate of large numbers of Croats, Bosnian Muslims and others who have disappeared.
241. The unwillingness of the State party to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is also deplored and extreme concern is expressed with regard to the apparent policy of the Government to purport to bestow impunity on perpetrators of fundamental violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.
242. The Committee draws attention to the letter dated 6 March 1995 from its Chairman to the State party and reiterates its contents.
The Committee will continue to consider the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to be bound by the terms of the Convention and looks forward to an early resumption of contact with the State party including its good-offices mission to Kosovo.
243. The Committee calls on the State party to cease immediately all policies and practices which violate rights under the Convention.
It insists that victims of discrimination, including ethnic Albanians, Muslims and ethnic Bulgarians, receive redress and reparation in accordance with article 6 of the Convention.
244. The Committee recommends the immediate drafting and implementation of legislation with a view towards the outlawing of every manifestation of racial discrimination and the full implementation of the Convention.
Particular attention should be paid to the legal regulation of matters such as the media and freedom of expression, employment and trade unions, the education system, and the health-care system.
The Committee places itself at the disposal of the State party to make available to it any technical assistance it may require to carry out such legislative programmes.
245. The Committee insists that all perpetrators of violations of the Convention be brought to justice.
It further calls on the State party to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
246. The Committee urgently suggests that the State party reconsider its failure to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and the special process on disappearances.
It notes the important role played by both these mechanisms in promoting compliance with the terms of the Convention.
247. The ninth, tenth and eleventh periodic reports of Romania, submitted in one document (CERD/C/210/Add.4), were considered by the Committee at its 1090th and 1091st meetings, held on 13 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1090-1091).
248. The reports were presented by representatives of the State party, who emphasized the importance attached to the Convention by the Government of Romania.
They explained that the Constitution calls for the creation of a people's advocate, who will be responsible also for the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities.
249. Regarding the diffusion of messages promoting discrimination, the representatives explained that Act 41 of 17 June 1994, which governs the Romanian Society for Radiodiffusion and the Romanian Society of Television, prohibits the use of radio and television to, inter alia, defame the nation, incite wars of aggression or promote racial, class-based or religious hatred or discrimination.
They maintained that the conflicts in Romania were inter-community rather than ethnic in character.
250. Members of the Committee expressed appreciation for the high level of representation and for the quality of the report, which adhered to its guidelines.
They underscored the importance of the many changes that had taken place in the State party in recent years, particularly that it had become a democratic nation that guaranteed its minorities the right to conserve, develop and express their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identities.
It was noted that the Government attached primary importance to its obligations under the international human rights treaties to which it was a State party, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
251. Members also noted that the Gypsy and Hungarian minorities were subject to serious de facto discrimination.
They asked what were the results of the inquiries into the events in T√Ærgu-Mures in March 1990 between the Romanians and Hungarians, which had not been completed at the time of the drafting of the report.
They asked whether the persons arrested and prosecuted in connection with the incidents were mostly Gypsy or Hungarian.
252. Members welcomed the participation of minorities in the parliamentary elections of September 1992 and asked what proportion of the Parliament was constituted by the 39 elected deputies from the Hungarian minority organization.
253. Members further took note of the Government's own acknowledgement in the reports that the situation in certain regions was not satisfactory, particularly with respect to small minorities.
A number of members requested clarification as to the difference between "ethnic" and "inter-community" tensions.
Members wished to know what other concrete measures were being taken by the Government to effectively prohibit incitement of racial discrimination and hatred.
They further expressed regret at the lack of information on the complaints registered and prosecutions pursued due to acts of racism and requested detailed information on this matter in the next periodic report.
254. Members asked whether the Government was considering making the declaration under article 14 of the Convention, according to which individuals could present communications regarding human rights violations before the Committee, or withdrawing its reservations to articles 17, 18 and 22.
Members inquired whether the Government was planning to adopt a law on minorities.
255. Members also inquired about a reported agreement between the Governments of Germany and Romania whereby groups of Gypsies would be transferred from the former to the latter nation.
They asked what were the specific provisions of the agreement and whether it was true that Romania was accepting money in return for accepting the Gypsies.
256. The representative of Romania thanked the members of the Committee for their interest and understanding of the situation in Romania and stressed that the views of the Committee were highly valued in Romania for shedding new perspectives on the domestic situation.
He questioned whether the expression "multiracial" was apposite as a description of Romania since over 89 per cent of the population was Romanian; the second largest group, the Hungarians, accounted for a further 7 per cent.
To call the country "multiracial" was to question the concept of Romania as a single, unitary nation.
In response to a question about the positions taken by certain Romanian political parties, it was explained that the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania had opposed the 1991 Constitution because it disputed the declaration contained therein that Romania was a national State which was unitary and indivisible.
In early 1995, the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania called for territorial autonomy on an ethnic basis in certain areas.
There were a number of other parties, however, that did not demand territorial autonomy but rather were devoted to the promotion of economic development and the protection of human rights and opposed racist, anti-Romanian, anti-Semitic, Fascist and neo-Nazi views.
257. The representatives acknowledged that confusion had been created by the preparation of a new Penal Code.
The Penal Code currently in force dated from 1968; its anti-democratic provisions were to be corrected.
The provisions of international treaties were incorporated into Romanian law; they ranked below the Constitution but took precedence over domestic law.
For most purposes, aliens and stateless residents enjoyed the same rights as Romanians, except for certain political and property ownership rights.
258. On the agreement between Romania and Germany, the representatives acknowledged that an agreement had been made between the two countries.
He stated, however, that it involved the repatriation of undocumented persons living in each party and was not specifically targeted at any ethnic group.
The transfer of DM 31 million called for in the agreement was to facilitate the professional and social reintegration of persons repatriated to Romania under the agreement.
259. The representatives also discussed the establishment in April 1993 of the Council for National Minorities, consisting of representatives of all national minorities and representatives of 12 government ministries. Each minority had the right to vote and the right to veto any Council action contrary to its interests, while the representatives of the Government had one vote each and could only veto decisions contrary to the law.
On the possibility of adopting a law on national minorities, the representatives explained that a bill proposed by the Hungarian minority was before the Parliament and that a national minorities bill was under consideration by the Government.
The representatives explained that the Constitution guaranteed the right of national minorities to be represented in Parliament and locally, and mentioned that many actually have been elected at both levels.
Members of national minority groups also served in the government administration.
260. Regarding the possibility of discrimination in employment, the representatives stated that such discrimination was prohibited in the Constitution, in the law on individual labour contracts and in ILO Convention No. 100 (Equal Remuneration Convention), to which Romania was a State party.
While most unemployed persons were Romanian nationals in areas predominantly Romanian, the complete eradication of discriminatory treatment in employment depended on the resolution of social, economic and political problems.
The representatives assured the Committee that the issue of employment would be dealt with more thoroughly in the next report.
261. Members of the Committee, while expressing deep appreciation for the detailed answers provided by the representatives of the Government, also expressed regret that the representatives had not addressed the question posed by several members as to what measures were being taken by the Government to end incitement of racial discrimination and hatred.
It was unclear whether legislation in fulfilment of obligations under article 4 was effectively implemented.
262. At its 1096th meeting, held on 16 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
263. The Committee welcomes the report of the State party, which was drafted in general accordance with the Committee's guidelines for the presentation of State party reports, and the additional material and oral information provided by the delegation.
264. The Committee expresses regret, however, that some additional answers provided did not fully address many of the questions posed by the Committee during the consideration of the report.
In particular, the information given only orally on the agreement between Romania and Germany on the transfer of Sinti and Roma is insufficient.
In this regard, the Committee invites the Government to submit in its next report information on the points raised in the present concluding observations and on any remaining questions posed during the consideration of the present report.
Given the short time remaining until the next report is due in October 1995, the Committee considers that that report should be a brief but complete update of the situation surrounding the rights protected in the Convention and that the following report, to be submitted in October 1997, should comprehensively address the situation regarding all of the articles contained therein.
265. The Committee expresses appreciation for the invitation extended by the delegation to visit Romania and to undertake direct consultations on the human rights situation with the competent authorities.
(b) Factors and difficulties impeding the application of the Convention
266. With Romania's history of authoritarian rule, which has severely impeded the enjoyment of many human rights in the State party, it is understood that the establishment and practical application of a new democratic and non-discriminatory political, economic and social framework is a difficult and time-consuming process.
(c) Positive aspects
267. Romania has also made progress in dismantling or revising the legal framework established during the period of authoritarian rule, particularly the Penal Code; it encourages democracy and openness in Romanian society and brings the legal codes closer in line with international human rights instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
The establishment of national human rights institutions is also noted, including the Council for National Minorities, the Centre for European Studies of Ethnic Problems, the Romanian Human Rights Institute, and the office of an Ombudsman to be exclusively concerned with the defence of human rights and freedoms.
It is noted that these actions conform with General Recommendation XVII on the establishment of national human rights institutions.
268. Regarding the Government's new policy directions regarding minorities, note is taken of the Government's intention to preserve the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of minorities and to protect them against attempts at forced assimilation, exclusion or segregation, as expressed in the Declaration on National Minorities of 20 November 1991.
The increasing political participation of minority groups in Romania, both at the national and local levels, is noted.
269. Satisfaction is expressed with the Government's efforts to raise awareness of international human rights standards through civic instruction in the schools and through human rights training programmes initiated in cooperation with international human rights organizations, including the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.
The legal provisions that prohibit speech which encourages racism or incites violence are also believed to be constructive.
270. Concern is expressed as to the continued prevalence of xenophobic attitudes and traditional prejudices in Romanian society against certain minorities, manifested in the appearance of extremist political parties and increasing acts of violence.
271. Concern is also expressed about the concept of the nation-State since it may result in weakening the policy of protecting minorities and could aggravate the relations between communities.
272. While it is noted that Romania's new legal framework prohibits manifestations of racism, including acts of violence, the propagation of racist speech, and discriminatory employment practices, the extent to which measures are being taken by the Government to translate the legal prohibition of such acts into effective prohibition is unclear.
Once such acts occur, it is not evident what remedies are available to victims and whether and how it is ensured that the guilty parties are prosecuted in an adequate and timely manner.
It is noted in this connection that with regard to the violence on 20 September 1993 which resulted in the death of three members of the Roma and the destruction of the homes of 170 others, victims have yet to receive compensation or have their homes reconstructed.
273. Concern is expressed at the continuing reports of racism among police forces, which have been said to occasionally use excessive force against members of certain groups or, alternatively, are said not to take action when acts of violence against certain groups are committed in their presence.
274. The Committee recommends that the Government include in its next report information regarding the legal force of the Convention in Romania, especially enforcement of article 4, whether it may be directly invoked by victims of racism, and whether any such cases have been tried before the courts (and if so, what was the outcome of those cases).
If codification into Romanian law is required before the Convention may be directly invoked, information is requested regarding the status of codification of the Convention.
Information on the legal force of the Declaration on National Minorities of 20 November 1991 is also requested.
275. The Committee recommends that further information on the Law on Minorities be provided in the next report.
It should contain the legal definition of "minorities", information on each of the ethnic groups listed in the present report (para. 16), and whether any special programmes are being implemented or are envisioned to improve the situation of the minorities identified, particularly the most vulnerable groups.
The Committee further recommends that the Government systematically collect data on foreigners residing in Romania and take steps to ensure that they are not subjected to harassment or other acts of racism and xenophobia.
276. The Committee invites the Government to provide in its next report information regarding the agreement signed with Germany on the repatriation of Sinti and Roma, specifically as to how many persons are affected, which ethnic groups they belong to, and what measures are being taken to facilitate their reintegration into the repatriated country.
277. The Committee recommends that the Government engage in a public campaign, conducted through the media, the schools and other means at the disposal of the Government, to familiarize the public with the Convention, to attempt to change traditional prejudices against minorities, and to convey messages of tolerance.
In this regard, the Government should continue to provide instruction on international human rights standards and norms in the schools and organize periodic training programmes for persons engaged in the administration of justice, including judges, police officers and lawyers.
278. The Committee recommends that the Government review and improve the training of law enforcement officials in the light of the Committee's general recommendation XIII.
Guatemala
279. The second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of Guatemala, combined in a single document (CERD/C/256/Add.1), were considered by the Committee at its 1092nd and 1093rd meetings, on 14 March 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1092-1093).
280. The reports were introduced by the representative of the State party who affirmed the importance accorded to the work of the Committee by his Government and the commitment of Guatemala to respect and promote the human rights of all its people.
Introductory comments were also made emphasizing key moments in the development of the country and noting ongoing concerns with regard to Belize.
281. It was explained that the population of Guatemala is primarily made up of indigenous peoples and that some 23 languages and dialects are spoken.
He emphasized that State policy stresses respect for the racial and cultural diversity of the people and described the functions of the newly established Fondo Nacional Indigena.
Certain structural weaknesses restrict the Government's ability to adequately promote the well-being of its people in areas such as health and education.
Particular problems are imposed by a history of political instability and ongoing armed conflict.
Strenuous efforts are now being made to conclude peace settlements and among the accords which have been agreed are those according a mediation role to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the establishment of the United Nations mission in Guatemala.
282. The representative stated that the Government's attempts to introduce economic reform have been hindered by the strategies of international financial institutions.
283. Members of the Committee welcomed measures taken with the aim of achieving a durable peace and ensuring the democratic process.
They also noted that, in accordance with the Constitution, all human rights instruments ratified or acceded to by Guatemala, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, have been given precedence over national legislation and can be directly invoked before the courts.
284. Concerning article 2 of the Convention members asked a number of questions concerning the extent to which the Government in its laws and policies actively combated racial discrimination, especially as directed against the majority indigenous peoples.
They noted that central to such a policy would be efforts to alleviate the economic disadvantages of those people.
Questions were also asked as to the effect of the armed combat on the struggle against racial discrimination.
Some members of the Committee asked about the generalized use of forcible recruitment of indigenous persons for military service, and about serious violations against the indigenous population by the army, which included summary executions and other cruel and degrading treatment.
In addition, some members asked about the situation of indigenous persons who were refugees who had returned, about communities which resisted and about "lost communities".
Members inquired as to the role of the army in police work and the activities of civilian self-defence patrols (PAC).
Members asked about the status of the new Penal Code and the extent of independence enjoyed by magistrates.
285. Members asked whether the Convention was at present citable in national courts or still awaited appropriate legislation.
They also sought clarification of article 45 of the Constitution concerning criminal liability for human rights violations.
Queries were expressed concerning the effectiveness of criminal legislation in combating racial discrimination.
286. Members indicated that Guatemalan law failed to comply with the terms of article 4 of the Convention through a failure to specifically address issues of racial discrimination.
287. With reference to article 5 members inquired as to the socio-economic status of indigenous peoples vis-√†-vis other members of society.
In the light of reports received by members it was also asked whether the rights of indigenous people to own property were adequately protected.
Concerns were expressed about the difficulties experienced by indigenous peoples in obtaining justice before the courts and in fully participating in the public life of the country.
Further information was requested concerning membership by indigenous peoples in development councils.
Questions were also put concerning the enjoyment by indigenous peoples and certain ethnic groups of freedom of religion, access to education, freedom of expression in the electronic media, and the right to form trade unions.
288. With regard to article 6 of the Convention members asked for confirmation that the army had compensated farmers for damage done to crops during military activity.
Information was also requested as to the number of specific cases of racial discrimination which had been brought before the courts and as to the effectiveness in such cases of remedies such as habeas corpus.
289. Pursuant to the terms of article 7 members inquired about the extent of human rights training provided for police and security officials.
Details were also requested on the efforts made by the Government to promote widespread knowledge of the Convention.
290. Members suggested that Guatemala consider making the declaration under article 14 of the Convention and consider accepting the amendment to article 18, paragraph 6, of the Convention concerning the financing of the expenses of the members of the Committee.
291. In replying to questions of members, the representative of the State party acknowledged the inadequacies of the report and indicated that his Government would submit an extended report in time for consideration at the forty-seventh session of the Committee.
It would also address outstanding matters in its next periodic report due in February 1996.
To facilitate the preparation of these reports the representative extended an invitation on behalf of the Government for the country rapporteur of the Committee to visit Guatemala.
292. The representative clarified a number of ambiguities in the report and stated that information of an ethnic nature might be sought in future national censuses in order to assist the State in complying with its reporting obligations.
293. It was noted that a number of positive developments in the country had not been reflected in the report, such as laws to give effect to article 70 of the Constitution and the establishment of the Guatemalan Indigenous Development Fund.
294. The representative acknowledged that there had been problems with PACs but indicated that great efforts were being made to have them disarmed and transformed into peace and development committees.
Improvements in the police force were noted as were presidential initiatives to turn the army into a volunteer force with adult soldiers only.
295. Governmental policies to facilitate the return of refugees and displaced people were described and the representative undertook to provide further information on such matters as the extent of compensation given to farmers whose crops had been destroyed by the army during military activity.
296. Reforms in the judicial system were noted and the representative indicated the priority given by the Government to ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the personal safety of judges and magistrates.
297. The representative also drew attention to policies for the alleviation of poverty and the provision of essential social services (housing, medical care, education, etc.) and indicated the high priority accorded these issues by the Government.
He noted that the procedure for ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 was under way in the Guatemalan Congress.
298. At its 1098th meeting, held on 17 March 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
299. The Committee welcomes the resumption of the dialogue with the Government of Guatemala and expresses its appreciation to the State party for its detailed report and for having submitted a core document (HRI/CORE/1/Add.47).
It notes with satisfaction that the oral information provided by the delegation in introducing the report and replying to questions raised during the dialogue enabled the Committee to obtain a clearer picture of the situation in the State party.
Nevertheless, the Committee regrets that the report does not provide information on the implementation of the Convention, as requested in article 9, paragraph 1, of the Convention.
In this connection, it takes note of the statement by the delegation indicating a willingness to pursue the dialogue with the Committee in the near future and provide it with further information on measures taken to implement the Convention.
(b) Positive factors
300. Measures taken with the aim of achieving a durable peace and ensuring the democratic process started in 1985 are welcomed.
It is further noted that, in accordance with the Constitution, all human rights instruments ratified or acceded to by Guatemala, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, have been given precedence over national legislation and can be invoked directly before the courts.
301. Steps taken by the military authorities to bring military personnel involved in crimes before the courts, and efforts to reduce the number of and review the need for PACs are acknowledged.
302. The creation of 3,000 teaching posts in 1994, including 800 in bilingual education, is also a welcome development.
303. It is noted with deep concern that because of the armed conflict there still exists in Guatemalan society a significant degree of militarization which contributes consequentially to the phenomenon whereby members of the armed forces have committed excesses against the civilian population in general and members of indigenous communities in particular.
304. The statement in paragraph 87 of the report that no form of racial discrimination is practised against persons, groups of persons or institutions is not accepted.
De facto racial discrimination persists in Guatemala against the indigenous communities representing the majority of the Guatemalan people.
It is noted with concern that no legal protection is offered in practice against such discrimination.
305. Profound concern is expressed regarding widespread discrimination affecting the indigenous communities and excluding them from the enjoyment of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
It is regretted that adequate measures have not been taken to implement the provisions of the Convention.
It is particularly regretted that members of the indigenous communities, contrary to article 5 (c) of the Convention, are not in any position to participate equally in the conduct of public affairs at all levels.
306. It is regretted that national legislation does not meet the requirements of article 4 of the Convention calling for the adoption of specific penal legislation.
307. Concern is expressed at the numerous excesses by elements of the military and the PACs against indigenous peoples, including summary executions and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, threats and forcible recruitment into the armed forces.
308. The failure to investigate these crimes and to prosecute the perpetrators is particularly deplored.
309. The lack of awareness of members of indigenous communities about recourse procedures, the shortage of practical facilities for them to use their own language in court procedures and the weaknesses of the judicial system are also regretted as is the resulting relative impunity for perpetrators of such violations.
310. Concern is also expressed that conditions of extreme poverty and social exclusion are endured, in particular by the indigenous Maya Quiche population.
Such conditions adversely affect the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under article 5 of the Convention such as the right to own property, the right to work, the right to form and join trade unions, and the right to housing, public health and education.
311. Particular concern is expressed that the rate of illiteracy is especially high among indigenous communities.
312. The Committee requests that the next report of the State party contain detailed information on the implementation of the provisions of the Convention.
313. The Committee also recommends that practical measures be taken by the Government to implement the Convention, in particular in respect of the members of indigenous communities.
Every effort should be made to ensure that the members of indigenous communities can effectively enjoy their economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights in accordance with article 5 of the Convention.
314. The Committee emphasizes that the State party must comply with its obligations under article 4 of the Convention and necessary legislative measures should be taken in order to give effect to the provisions of that article.
315. The Committee recommends that more information be provided in the next periodic report on the implementation of the provisions of article 5 of the Convention.
The State party is requested to provide detailed information on measures taken to ensure the political, social and economic integration of the indigenous communities, as well as their physical existence and cultural heritage; efforts to reduce the militarization of the society and the impact of the PACs; cases of complaints of racial discrimination brought before the courts, penalties imposed on perpetrators of such acts of racial discrimination and remedies and reparation made available to victims of racial discrimination.
316. The Committee calls upon the Government to review and improve the training of law enforcement officials in the light of the Committee's General Recommendation XIII.
317. The Committee recommends that the State party consider ratifying ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.
318. The Committee suggests that the State party consider making the declaration under article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention, recognizing the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within its jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the rights set forth in the Convention.
319. The Committee suggests that the State party ensure the dissemination of its periodic report, the summary records of the discussion and the concluding observations adopted thereon.
(f) Other measures
320. The Committee takes note with satisfaction of the proposal of the State party to submit additional information at the forty-seventh session in August 1995, and also of the decision to submit a new periodic report in February 1996, and expects that these proposals will be fulfilled.
The Committee further takes note with appreciation of the official invitation to send one of its members to Guatemala with a view to assisting the State party in its implementation of the Convention.
Belarus
321. The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth periodic reports of Belarus, submitted in one document (CERD/C/263/Add.4), were considered by the Committee at its 1101st and 1102nd meetings, on 1 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1101-1102).
322. The report was introduced by the representative of the State party, who highlighted the principal points of the report, drawing the attention of the Committee to the new legislative acts adopted during the past few years with due regard paid to the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Particular reference was made to the relevant parts of the Constitution, to the Act on National Minorities in the Republic of Belarus, the Bishkek Agreement, article 71 of the Criminal Code, article 6 (1) of the Code of Labour Laws, the Act on Trade Unions, the National Housing Programme and acts relating to the right to education, culture and access to information.
The representative of the State party indicated that during the reporting period - from 1988 to 1 July 1995 - no criminal proceedings had been recorded regarding allegations of racial discrimination.
323. Members of the Committee welcomed the resumption of dialogue with the State party and observed that the country's transition to democracy and a multi-party system was proceeding without serious ethnic tension or strife of the kind that had developed in most other former republics of the Soviet Union, for which the country deserved credit.
Having noted that political and economic transition inevitably entailed a certain incoherence in a country's internal situation and policies, they felt able to commend the report submitted by Belarus even though it was not fully in compliance with the Convention.
324. It was of particular concern to the members of the Committee that the report lacked information on the demographic composition of Belarusian society.
325. In relation to article 2 of the Convention, members indicated that although the report contained many references to various legislative acts, there was little information on the content of those acts and no information on the extent to which they had been implemented, especially as far as the Act on National Minorities in the Republic of Belarus was concerned.
In addition, they noted that the report's coverage of the legal situation was far more detailed than the factual information provided on national or ethnic minorities.
326. The members of the Committee recommended that Belarus consider withdrawing its reservation to the Convention since this reflected the tensions of an earlier age.
327. With respect to article 4 of the Convention, members of the Committee indicated that legislation so far adopted, and in particular article 71 of the Criminal Code, appeared to be consistent with the provisions contained in subparagraph (a) of that article, but not with those contained in subparagraph (b).
The report gave no indication of how or whether steps had been taken to prevent public authorities or institutions from promoting or inciting racial discrimination, or whether public officials received training to ensure that they did not encourage discrimination by word or deed.
328. In connection with article 5 of the Convention, members of the Committee, having noted that the report under consideration provided less information than the tenth periodic reports, wished to know whether national minorities were represented in the Supreme Council and local government and administration; whether it was possible to form political parties or other organizations in Belarus on the basis of ethnicity; and, given the large number of minorities in Belarus, whether any action had been taken to encourage integrationist multiracial organizations and movements to bring the minorities together and make them feel they were all part of one people.
329. In connection with article 6 of the Convention, members of the Committee regretted the lack of sufficient information with respect to its implementation.
They noted that no cases of criminal proceedings for offences under article 71 of the Criminal Code had been recorded so far.
Members recalled in that connection that the Committee on earlier occasions had remarked that the absence of such cases might stem from a lack of information on the part of the population regarding their rights and the remedies open to them, or from insufficient attention by the judicial authorities to that type of offence.
330. In connection with article 7 of the Convention, members of the Committee welcomed the attention being given in schools to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
At the same time, they wished to have more information on measures taken by the Government to provide training for teachers, magistrates and police officers in order to sensitize them to the nature of racial discrimination.
331. With respect to article 8 of the Convention, members asked whether Belarus would consider ratifying the amendments to provisions on the financing of the Committee (art. 8, para. 6).
332. In relation to article 9 of the Convention, members of the Committee emphasized that compliance with its paragraph 1, regarding the regular submission of reports, was of the greatest importance.
333. In connection with article 14 of the Convention, members of the Committee, noting that Belarus was a State party to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, wished to know whether Belarus would consider making the declaration recognizing the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals claiming to be victims of a violation by the State party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention.
334. Replying to questions and comments by members of the Committee, the representative of the State party said that the situation covered by the report was constantly evolving, so that it was more concerned with general trends.
Because of that difficult situation of transition, the requisite statistics were not available.
335. As to the demographic composition of the population, the representative said that according to the 1994 census, there were 10.4 million inhabitants.
The ethnic groups were divided as follows: Belarusians, 78 per cent; Russians, 13 per cent; Poles, 4 per cent; Ukrainians, 3 per cent; Jews, 1 per cent; and other nationalities, 1 per cent.
336. The representative said that there were no political parties in Belarus founded on a purely national or ethnic basis.
337. With regard to the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, the declaration provided for under article 14 of the Convention and the question of the reservation formulated by Belarus at the time of ratification, the representative of the State party assured the Committee that he would transmit its recommendations to his Government.
338. In conclusion, the representative of the State party thanked the members of the Committee for their many observations during the course of the debate, which Belarus would find helpful in drafting its fourteenth periodic report.
He also asked the Committee to send Belarus information on the political representation of national minorities in State decision-making bodies together with concrete recommendations on the matter, which the Government could then follow in revising its national legislation.
The Committee's assistance had been sought for the drafting of the electoral law currently under preparation in Belarus.
339. At its 1122nd meeting, on 15 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
340. Appreciation is expressed to the State party for its readiness to continue the dialogue with the Committee.
It is regretted, however, that the eleventh and twelfth periodic reports were not submitted on time.
341. At the same time it is observed that Belarus has undergone radical political, social and economic changes since the Committee's last consideration of the State party's report in 1989 and that the process of transition towards a multi-party democracy and a market economy is still under way in Belarus with all the difficulties that such a process may generate.
342. It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14, and some members requested that the possibility of such a declaration be considered.
343. The legislative measures adopted by the Government of Belarus with a view to bringing national legislation into conformity with the Convention are welcomed.
In that connection, note is taken of the Act of the Republic of Belarus "On the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus" and the actual establishment of the Court; of the Act of the Republic of Belarus "On national minorities in the Republic of Belarus" designed to prevent and combat discrimination on grounds of nationality and incitement of enmity between different nationalities; of the law on culture of 1991; of the law on languages of Belarus of 1990; of the signature by Belarus of the Bishkek agreement on matters connected with the restoration of the rights of deported persons, national minorities and peoples; and of the forthcoming establishment of the Council on international relations.
344. It is regretted that not enough information has been provided by the State party on legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the Convention.
345. Concern is again expressed that the State party has not implemented the provisions contained in article 4 (b) of the Convention and has not provided information on the practical implementation of provisions of article 4 (c).
346. The Committee recommends that in its next periodic report the State party fully reports on judicial, administrative and other measures adopted to give effect to the Convention.
347. The Committee further strongly recommends that the State party comply fully with the obligations under article 4 of the Convention and that necessary legislative measures be taken in order to give full effect to the relevant provisions of that article.
348. The Committee requests the Government of Belarus to provide it, in its fourteenth report due in 1996, with information on the ethnic composition of Belarussian society and on the situation of different minorities in terms of their participation in public life and their access to education, culture and information in their mother tongue.
349. The Committee draws the State party's attention to the periodicity of reporting as established by the Convention and urges the State party to comply therewith.
350. The Committee recommends that the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, within the framework of its technical cooperation programmes, assist Belarus, as requested by the delegation of the State party, in its efforts to harmonize national legislation with the Convention.
351. The Committee recommends that the State party ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
352. The Committee recommends that the State party's fourteenth periodic report, due on 7 May 1996, be a brief updating report.

353. The Committee considered the ninth and tenth periodic reports of Mexico, consolidated in one document (CERD/C/260/Add.1), at its 1104th and 1105th meetings, held on 2 and 3 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1104-1105).
Together with the ninth and tenth periodic reports, the Committee also examined the report containing additional information (CERD/C/286), requested by the Committee in its decision No. 2 (46) of 9 March 1995, in accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the Convention.
354. The reports were introduced by the representative of the State party, who reaffirmed that the phenomenon of racial discrimination did not exist in Mexico, although the most vulnerable groups in society, such as women, disabled persons, migrant workers and indigenous people, did suffer some forms of discrimination caused by socio-economic factors.
It was difficult to quantify the indigenous population.
Based on estimates made for strictly statistical purposes and the language criterion according to which indigenous persons are those speaking an indigenous language, there were 7 to 10 million indigenous people in Mexico.
He acknowledged that the language criterion alone was inadequate and that the criterion of self-identification, for example, should be considered a fundamental criterion, in conformity with ILO Convention No. 169.
355. He went on to state that it was only since 1991 that Mexico, despite its age-old history as a State, had recognized itself legally as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nation.
Until then, and since its accession to independence nearly two centuries previously, the indigenous populations had been regarded at best as peoples to be civilized and to be assimilated culturally.
The meagre results of that policy of integrating the indigenous people implemented over several decades had brought it home to the Mexicans that it was a mistake to seek at all costs to build a homogeneous country and deny the deep-seated roots of the Mexican nation.
Now that the cultural diversity of the Mexican population was recognized by the Constitution, whose article 4 had been amended to that effect, it was necessary to adjust the whole body of Mexican legislation in order to eradicate all discriminatory practices, particularly in the fields of access to natural resources, the administration of justice, the administrative organization of communities and education.
356. Introducing the additional report requested by the Committee at its forty-sixth session (decision No. 2 (46)) and dealing mainly with the conflict which had broken out in the State of Chiapas in 1994, he explained that the conflict was the painful expression of the despair caused by extreme poverty.
He said that, right from the beginning of the conflict, the Federal Government had acknowledged the legitimacy of some of the reasons that had led members of the indigenous communities to rebel; those reasons stemmed from economic and social marginalization and had nothing to do with racism or racial discrimination.
The Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) itself had not reported any problems of racial discrimination within the meaning of the Convention.
He then described the measures and programmes adopted by the Government for the State of Chiapas, amounting to some $129 million.
357. The members of the Committee thanked the State party for its detailed, frank reports and for submitting additional written information on the situation in the State of Chiapas.
358. Members of the Committee expressed their difference of opinion with the Government on the kind of discrimination suffered by many indigenous people in Mexico, pointing out that it did in fact fall within the scope of articles 2 and 5 of the Convention.
The discriminatory nature of policies or practices that perpetuated the marginalization and impoverishment of certain ethnic groups was indeed a form of racial discrimination within the meaning of the Convention.
359. Committee members acknowledged that, by recognizing the specific rights of the indigenous communities, the amendment to article 4 of the Mexican Constitution marked an important step in the transition from a mestizo society to a multi-cultural nation.
Without statutes and measures to implement that provision, however, the constitutional reform would be of little practical effect.
Members of the Committee also noted that, in many instances, the oppression of the indigenous communities was due less to the absence of legal rules than to the fact that economic interest groups and local politicians pursued their abusive practices to the detriment of indigenous groups with impunity.
360. Members of the Committee noted with interest the steps taken by the Government to improve the economic and social conditions of the indigenous communities, particularly the programmes designed to overcome extreme poverty, such as the National Solidarity Programme and the National Programme for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples.
The innovative character of certain approaches was commended.
A most interesting new feature, for example, was the programme for the reform of the justice system which takes into account Indian customs in court proceedings.
It was felt that this would also improve mutual cultural recognition and consultation among all sectors of society.
That programme was to be classified among the measures of positive discrimination provided for in article 1 of the Convention.
361. Committee members drew attention, however, to the lack of information in the report by the State party on the real impact of those programmes.
They expressed their concern about allegations from reliable sources about their ineffectiveness and the corrupt practices of certain local officials or powerful landowners.
In that connection, members of the Committee stressed the importance of selecting social indicators that would make it possible to decide which sectors merited a priority input of resources and to determine whether the programmes had the expected impact.
362. Referring to the various bodies set up at the federal level to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples, members of the Committee acknowledged that the measures taken by them were undeniably important, but wondered whether the fact that there were so many of them did not entail a risk of bureaucratization and duplication.
It was essential to ensure smooth coordination between the various bodies.
Committee members also wished to know whether members of the indigenous communities took part in the management of those institutions in positions of responsibility.
363. Members of the Committee raised a question that was of fundamental importance for the indigenous populations, that of land, which was crucial to their subsistence, but also to their identity.
There was evidence that the administrative measures taken by the Mexican Government were insufficient to guarantee fair and equitable treatment of members of indigenous communities in the process of land distribution.
For decades, landowners had been illegally dispossessing the indigenous peoples of their lands.
The Indians had been gradually driven from the fertile lands along the Pacific coast towards the central highlands and finally to the rainforest in the east, which was ill-suited to agriculture.
Members of the Committee noted that the Mexican Government had long been accused by human rights organizations of doing nothing to put an end to the land-related violence in rural areas, regarding it as inevitable.
Committee members also observed that the indigenous communities in Mexico viewed the recent amendment to article 27 of the Constitution and the promulgation of the new agrarian law in 1992 as a further threat to their already fragile economic activities and to their identity.
Moreover, the economic situation of the indigenous communities seemed to have deteriorated since Mexico's signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Members of the Committee requested more information on the practical effects of the 1992 constitutional reform and on the Government's response to EZLN demands with regard to land.
364. Turning to the question of the conflict in the State of Chiapas, members of the Committee, welcoming the Government's efforts to find a political rather than a military solution to the conflict, wished to know what measures had been taken to put an end to the activities of the paramilitary groups still present there, whether the detainees who had not yet been released had benefited from fair and equitable legal procedures and whether the civilians and the military personnel responsible for the disappearances, arbitrary executions and torture had been arrested and brought to justice.
365. On the subject of article 4 of the Convention, members of the Committee noted that there was a continuing misunderstanding between the Committee and the Mexican Government, which maintained that no specific legislation was needed to implement that article because the question of the indigenous people was never seen in terms of racial discrimination.
That position did not meet the requirements of the Committee, which considered that specific measures must be adopted, even when there was no evidence of racist phenomena in a country, if only to prevent racial or ethnic discrimination and for educational purposes.
366. With regard to article 5 of the Convention, members of the Committee noted that, as the Mexican Government itself acknowledged with great candour, the indigenous populations were still in fact subject to discrimination in many areas, such as education and training in general, the right to their own language and culture, health, access to a nutritious and balanced diet, access to land ownership, access to infrastructure like the road network and other means of communication and access to justice.
Committee members again pointed to the inadequacy of the steps taken and the lack of clear information on their impact. They requested the State party to provide more details on the implementation of article 5 of the Convention in the next periodic report.
367. On the subject of article 6 of the Convention, it was noted that, although it appeared that the Convention could be invoked directly before the courts in a case of racial discrimination, nothing had been said about the kind of sentences that might be handed down by the judge in such a case.
368. The information provided on article 7 of the Convention was noted with great interest by the Committee, which considered that the prospects afforded by the steps already taken were most promising.
It was felt that since Mexico's cultural heritage was unique it should be cultivated, developed and made widely known.
Encouraging the Government to continue with the dissemination of the ancestral culture of the indigenous population, the Committee recommended that the State party should associate the indigenous communities of other countries with such events, as had already been done with Bolivia, in order to foster a sense of cultural solidarity.
369. Replying to Committee members' questions and comments, the representative of the State party explained that the amendment to article 27 of the Constitution had been justified by the fact that there was no longer enough land available for distribution and that the amendment had not affected the existing social guarantees in agrarian matters, including the ban on large estates.
370. The representative affirmed the Government's will to leave no violation committed during the events in the State of Chiapas unpunished and offered to inform the United Nations Centre for Human Rights of the proceedings of inquiries conducted and sentences handed down in that connection.
He also specified that all the rebels detained had been released as of July 1994 and invited the members of the Committee to read the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had been present in Chiapas during the 18 months following the outbreak of the conflict.
371. The representative also informed the Committee that one of the points on which agreement had been reached with the EZLN, the revision of the Penal Code, was in the process of being implemented.
372. Lastly, the representative assured the members of the Committee that the next periodic report of Mexico would contain more information on the implementation of article 5 of the Convention.
373. At its 1124th meeting, held on 16 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
374. The submission by the State party of a detailed and frank periodic report, prepared in accordance with the Committee's revised guidelines for the preparation of reports, and of additional written information on the situation prevailing in the State of Chiapas, requested by the Committee in its decision 2 (46) of 29 March 1995, is welcomed.
Appreciation is also expressed for the supplementary information provided orally by the delegation of the State party.
375. It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention, and some members requested that the possibility of such a declaration be considered.
376. The legislative and other measures adopted by the Government in favour of the indigenous population, in accordance with article 2 of the Convention, are welcomed.
It is noted with satisfaction in particular that the amendment to article 4 of the Constitution in January 1992 represents a fundamental shift in the State party's policy towards indigenous peoples, since it states that the Mexican nation has a multicultural composition originally based on its indigenous peoples and recognizes, for the first time since Mexico's independence, special constitutional rights for the indigenous people living on its territory.
377. As regards the Chiapas conflict, it is noted with satisfaction that in January 1994, the Government decided to take steps to seek a political rather than a military solution, unilaterally declared a ceasefire, decreed a general amnesty and established the National Commission for Comprehensive Development and Social Justice for Indigenous Peoples.
378. The efforts made by the State party to set up a bilingual-bicultural education system in favour of the indigenous groups are welcomed.
379. The amendment of articles 18 to 22 of the Constitution intended to expand the constitutional rights of accused persons in criminal proceedings of indigenous origin, as well as the ongoing revision of the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes, are also noted with satisfaction.
380. The situation of extreme poverty and marginalization of the majority of the indigenous population in Mexico is a matter of concern.
Such a situation has complex causes, some of them stemming from the impact of the encounter of civilizations, as well as the consequences of the recent internationalization of the economy for social policies in Mexico.
It has been and still is the responsibility of the Government to improve the economic and social situation of the indigenous population of Mexico.
381. Concern is expressed at the lack of information in the State party's reports on the actual implementation of constitutional and legal measures, and on the impact of the various policies and programmes adopted by Mexico in applying the provisions of the Convention.
382. Particular concern is expressed that the State party does not seem to perceive that pervasive discrimination being suffered by the 56 indigenous groups living in Mexico falls under the definition given to racial discrimination in article 1 of the Convention.
The description of their plight merely as an unequal participation in social and economic development is inadequate.
383. Concern is also expressed that too little attention is given by the State party to the effects on the economic situation of the indigenous communities, of adherence to the North American Free Trade Agreement and of the related 1992 constitutional and legislative reform of the land ownership system.
384. While the achievements of the National Indigenous Institute are commended, note is taken of the insufficient coordination between the various institutes and commissions which are charged with protecting the rights of the indigenous communities in Mexico, as well as their bureaucratic functioning.
385. Concern is expressed that the State party still has not implemented the provisions in article 4 of the Convention.
386. Concern continues regarding the serious discrimination indigenous peoples have to face in respect of the enjoyment of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
Particular concern is expressed at the inequitable treatment of indigenous people in the process of land distribution, including restitution, and at the violent and illegal resolution of many land disputes, at the amendment to article 27 of the Constitution, and at the lack of support given to the bilingual-bicultural education system.
387. It is not clear how the Convention is incorporated into the Federal and State legal systems nor whether the provisions of the Convention can be directly invoked before the courts.
388. The Committee recommends that the State party pursue its efforts to analyse the root causes of the socio-economic marginalization faced by the indigenous population of Mexico and continue its attempts to harmonize indigenous customs with the positive legal order.
389. The Committee draws the attention of the State party to the necessity of adopting indicators to evaluate the policies and programmes aimed at the protection and promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples.
390. The Committee recommends that the State party review the functioning of and the coordination between the various institutions in charge of the protection of indigenous people's rights.
391. The Committee reaffirms that the provisions of article 4, paragraphs (a) and (b), of the Convention are of a mandatory character as stated in general recommendation XV (32) of the Committee and recommends that the State party implement each of the obligations.
392. The Committee wishes the Government of Mexico to provide, in its next report, detailed information on the implementation of article 5 of the Convention.
393. The Committee strongly recommends that the State party find a fair and equitable solution for the distribution, including restitution, of lands.
As far as land disputes are concerned, all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the rule of law is applied without improper interference, in particular by powerful landowners.
394. The Committee strongly recommends that the State party make an increased effort in promoting affirmative measures in the field of education and training.
395. The Committee recommends that the Mexican Government ensure that violations of indigenous people's human rights be investigated, and that the victims receive compensation.
396. Welcome is expressed for the proposal, made orally by the delegation, of providing the United Nations Centre for Human Rights with regular and detailed information in that respect.
397. The Committee recommends that the State party ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
398. The Committee recommends that the State party's eleventh periodic report, due on 22 March 1996, be an updating report.
New Zealand
399. The Committee considered the tenth and eleventh periodic reports of New Zealand, submitted in a single document (CERD/C/239/Add.3 and HRI/CORE/1/Add.33) at its 1106th and 1107th meetings, held on 3 and 4 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1106-1107).
400. The representative of the State party made an introductory statement highlighting the main points contained in the reports.
Major legislative changes mentioned included the adoption of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992, the Te Ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act 1993, the Human Rights Act 1993 and the Electoral Act 1993.
Other developments included the restructuring of Maori affairs administration, through the establishment of the Ministry of Maori Development, Te Puni Kokiri, in 1991.
The representative explained that the focus of that Ministry was to develop an environment of opportunity and choice for the Maori by improving Maori performance in areas of education, employment, business development and health.
The initiatives taken to strengthen the Ministry of Pacific and Island Affairs and to establish the Ethnic Affairs Service within the Ministry of Internal Affairs were also mentioned.
In addition, the representative informed the Committee of the revision of New Zealand's immigration and refugee policy which allowed entry to New Zealand of migrants from non-traditional sources.
401. As regards the developments which had taken place since the preparation of the reports, the representative stated that a key area of government attention continued to be the promotion of the settlement of historical Maori grievances and claims under the Treaty of Waitangi.
This had led to the appointment of a Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations and the setting up of an Office of Treaty Settlements.
The main responsibilities of that Office were outlined.
Basically, they were concerned with the development of policies for the Crown with regard to the settlement of Treaty claims and assisting the Minister in negotiating and implementing the settlement of those claims.
Additionally, the representative informed the Committee about the Government's proposed policies to settle Treaty of Waitangi-based land claims through the allocation of $NZ 1 billion which has become known as the "Settlement Envelope" or "Fiscal Envelope".
It was explained that while claimants do not have to agree to the specific amount contained in that "Envelope", as a precondition for negotiation, the setting of an amount would be beneficial for the assessment of the fairness of claimants' settlements.
The representative stated that the process of consultation with Maori had revealed widespread concern about the proposals in their current form.
402. Further information on the settlement of claims either through direct negotiation with the Crown or through the Waitangi Tribunal process was provided by the representative of the State party.
In this connection, mention was made of the settlement of a historic grievance with the Waikato-Tainui tribe and that 460 claims were registered with the Waitangi Tribunal of which 10 were under active consideration.
Moreover, it was indicated that solutions for resolving land grievances were also available through the Maori reserved land lease reform and by Order in Council.
403. Additionally, the representative of the State party provided details of several administrative and policy measures taken to address Maori concerns, including in the areas of education, employment, health and social welfare.
In this regard, it was indicated, inter alia, that since 1993 there had been an expansion of Maori education initiatives particularly with respect to early childhood and bilingual education.
Despite the successes evidenced in the last 10 years because of the increase in Maori enrolment in childhood education and tertiary education and the advances made in school retention rates, it was explained that improvements had also been witnessed for non-Maori students and so a sizeable gap between the two groups remained.
404. Information was also provided on the changes occurring in the immigration population in view of the growing number of recently accepted immigrants coming from countries in the Asian region.
Details were also given of the quota permitting the entry of refugees under New Zealand's immigration policy.
Additionally, a brief description of recent events in Tokelau was provided with respect to Tokelau's consideration of constitutional changes and of an act of self-determination.
405. By way of conclusion, the representative stated that the period under review had been characterized by significant developments particularly with respect to the development of a dialogue and of consultation with the Maori and to promote the economic and social advancement of all groups within the society.
406. The members of the Committee expressed their appreciation to the State party for its comprehensive, detailed and honest report as well as for its informative and frank introductory statement.
They noted with satisfaction the seriousness with which New Zealand fulfilled its reporting obligations, particularly as the State party had made considerable efforts in responding to requests for information made during the previous dialogue with the Committee.
It was also noted that the Government had undertaken various measures with respect to the implementation of the provisions under the Convention, particularly in the light of its recognition of the need to address the disparities existing between different ethnic groups in the country with respect to educational, health and other matters.
Moreover, the members of the Committee noted New Zealand's efforts in the past to prepare Niue and the Cook Islands for self-government and its efforts to assist in introducing constitutional change in Tokelau as well as its commitment to continuing to provide assistance to those countries in the future which had chosen free association with New Zealand.
407. With reference to article 2 of the Convention, members of the Committee noted that a plethora of human rights mechanisms existed in New Zealand and in this connection they wished to know how the State party ensured that the problems of duplication of work and overlapping of mandates did not arise.
They also wished to receive further details of the provisions of the new Human Rights Act 1993 with respect to the implementation of the rights provided for in the Convention.
408. Clarification was requested as regards the status of the Treaty of Waitangi and whether it had validity under international law.
Further information was also requested with respect to the activities of the Waitangi Tribunal, its composition and whether its recommendations were implemented.
In addition, information was requested as regards the concerns raised by Maori with respect to the settlement of claims, the basis of arriving at the amount of money contained in the "Fiscal Envelope" and whether that figure was negotiable.
Clarification was also requested as regards the effect of the "Fiscal Envelope" on the economic situation of Maori.
409. Questions were raised by members of the Committee about the nature of the concerns expressed by Maori over the adoption of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992 and with regard to the results of the court proceedings instituted against the Crown over the settlement as well as the means employed for the identification of those claiming settlement under the Treaty.
In addition, members of the Committee expressed interest in receiving further information about the communication before the Human Rights Committee in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992.
410. Members of the Committee requested clarification as to the effect of the Waitangi Tribunal Amendment Act 1993 with respect to the Crown's return to Maori of private land for the settlement of claims.
In this regard, the Committee noted that from information contained in the State party report it appeared that the Maori's share of the land was not commensurate with the size of its population and that much of the land was owned by the Crown or in private, non-Maori hands.
The Committee observed that the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act was an area of concern insofar as it appeared to discount claims to land that had been confiscated by private parties, possibly by unlawful seizure in a previous period.
411. Members of the Committee wished to know more about the provisions and implementation of the Te Ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act 1993, especially with respect to those provisions of the Act requiring the strict application of rules for the transfer of ownership of Maori land.
412. With respect to article 4 of the Convention, members of the Committee emphasized the importance of the provisions of part (b) of that article, particularly as a means to prevent racial discrimination.
413. In connection with article 5 of the Convention, members requested further information on the impact of economic restructuring on the situation of different population groups, particularly with respect to housing and employment conditions and the development of Maori education.
Members of the Committee also wished to know more about the electoral reform and its effect on Maori representation in Parliament as well as about the new immigration policy instituted in New Zealand and its possible impact on racial harmony.
414. Concerning article 6 of the Convention, members wished to know more about the number of complaints and whether there had been a noticeable improvement in the protection of the rights provided for in the Convention since the adoption of the new Human Rights Act.
Further information was requested on the racial discrimination complaints procedures and the personal grievance procedures under the Employment Contracts Act.
415. In relation to article 7 of the Convention, members of the Committee requested information concerning the investigation of reported cases of ill-treatment in prisons and of the measures taken to address such situations, including the setting up of an independent prison complaints authority and the introduction of human rights education for prison staff.
They also asked for more information about the proportion of offences committed by Maori and whether appropriate psychological counselling was available to Maori in prison.
416. With respect to article 14 of the Convention, members of the Committee expressed the hope that New Zealand would consider making the declaration under this article so that grievances relating to racial discrimination could be brought to the Committee.
417. In reply to the questions raised in relation to article 2 of the Convention, the representative agreed that there were a variety of organizations responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights, including the Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Race Relations Conciliator, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Children's Commissioner, the Ombudsman and the Retirement Commissioner.
There was not considered to be any overlapping or competition between the different areas of responsibility of these mechanisms.
However, he noted that there could be initial confusion about the responsibilities of the Race Relations Conciliator, the Waitangi Tribunal, Te Puri Kokiri and the Human Rights Commission.
418. The representative of the State party also stated that section 5 of the Human Rights Act had enhanced the functions and powers of the Human Rights Commission and the Race Relations Conciliator.
In this case, the Race Relations Conciliator had been given a wider jurisdiction to inquire into or make statements about race matters that did not fall within the Conciliator's unlawful discrimination jurisdiction.
Section 73 of the 1993 Human Rights Act provided for affirmative action policies consistent with article 2 of the Convention.
Indirect discrimination was covered by section 65 of the Human Rights Act, while sections 61 and 131 of the Act provided for penalties for racially offensive expressions.
In this regard, he explained that while section 61.2 of the Human Rights Act provided a defence for a publisher or broadcaster if the report accurately conveyed the intention of the publisher or broadcaster, there was no similar defence under section 131 of the Act which carried a criminal penalty with respect to the intent to excite hostility or ill-will or to bring into contempt or ridicule.
419. Concerning the status of the Treaty of Waitangi, the representative explained that it had been recognized as a founding domestic constitutional document which had been concluded between the British Sovereign and the Maori Chiefs of New Zealand in 1840.
There had never been a need for a judicial ruling on the question of whether the Treaty of Waitangi had any validity under international law.
With respect to the Waitangi Tribunal it was indicated that it was a quasi-judicial body which had statutory authority.
The Tribunal was composed of 16 members, 6 of whom were Maori.
The Government maintained the ability to accept or reject the Tribunal's recommendations.
Those recommendations may be made in general terms or may indicate in specific terms the action which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the Crown should take.
It was further explained that while not all recommendations made by the Tribunal were implemented, the Government was committed to maintaining the reputation of the Tribunal as an effective mechanism for solving Treaty grievances.
420. The Committee was informed that the "Fiscal Envelope" was based on the notion that redress might consist of assets, money and rights.
The Government recognized that monetary settlements were preferable since they enabled claimants to repurchase lands or assets themselves.
In that connection, the Government had set up two different mechanisms.
The first was the Crown protection mechanism, under which surplus land belonging to the Crown was held pending the settlement of claims and surplus land could be used in partial settlement and second priority was given to claims submitted by persons residing in "confiscated lands".
It was further explained that the amount of money offered in the "Fiscal Envelope" was arrived at following a political decision and was not open to discussion.
In arriving at that sum the Government had carefully balanced the objective of providing durable settlements and removing the claimants' sense of grievance concerning the affordability of the sum and its acceptability to the wider community.
The representative also informed the Committee that while there was considerable support among Maori for the settlement of Treaty claims, there was general dissatisfaction within the Maori community over the progress of individual Treaty claim settlement and that this had been exacerbated by Maori concern about the sale of Crown-owned assets.
In view of that concern, the Government had recently decided to put a hold on sales of all surplus Crown land located within the major areas in which land confiscation had occurred in the last century.
That decision had met with strong support by claimants who viewed the Crown's action as a demonstration of its good faith and commitment to settling land confiscation claims.
As an example of the achievements possible in the settlement of claims through the ongoing goodwill of both the Crown and Maori, mention was made of the recent settlement of the Waikato-Tainui land confiscation claim.
Moreover, the representative informed the Committee that the settlement of historical grievances would not abrogate government policies to improve the social and economic position of the Maori.
He clarified the Government's position with respect to the fact that nothing in the settlements would remove, restrict or replace Maori rights under article III of the Treaty of Waitangi, including Maori access to mainstream government policies.
421. Replying to the questions raised concerning the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992, the representative explained that the reservations expressed by Maori members of Parliament during the passage of the Act included concern about the provisions of the Act that declared the Settlement to finally settle all claims, both current and future, by Maori in respect of commercial fishing.
He further indicated that court proceedings were instituted by representatives of ewi opposed to the settlement and its recognition in legislation.
Those proceedings were dismissed by the Court of Appeal in Te Runanga o Wharekauri v. Attorney-General (1993) on the basis of the established principle of non-interference by the courts in parliamentary proceedings.
It was further stated that many of the issues raised in opposition to the settlement were incorporated into the communication lodged with the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
422. In reply to a question on the role of the Waitangi Fisheries Commission in identifying fisheries settlement beneficiaries, the representative pointed out that settlements under the Waitangi Treaty were not negotiated directly with the Maori population.
The Crown needed assurance that the settlement was being made with the right tribe or sub-tribe grouping so as to ensure a final settlement and avoid further grievances.
It was also important to note that all persons entitled to benefits by virtue of their tribal membership were identified and had the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting the distribution of benefits.
423. Concerning the Waitangi Tribunal Amendment Act 1993, the representative explained that the amendment to section 6 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 arose following the Te Rora report of April 1992 when a division of the Tribunal recommended that the Crown purchase certain private lands involved in that claim.
Thus, the amendment was necessary to protect the status of the Tribunal and its acceptance by the people of New Zealand as a whole.
424. The representative explained that under the provisions of the Te Ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act all land in New Zealand had been classified into a number of different categories.
In particular, the Act made an important distinction with regard to the requirements for the alienation of Maori freehold land.
He explained that the rules regarding alienation of Maori land applied to the transfer of land between Maori as well as to non-Maori and that the Act was designed to promote the retention of Maori land in the hands of whanau and hapu descendants of the person transferring the land.
The general theme of the Act was the retention of Maori land within the traditional descent group associated with the relevant land.
Thus, the Act was designed to address the concern of Maori at the gradual loss of Maori freehold land and also to establish structures for the more effective use, management and development of multiple-owned Maori land.
425. With regard to the concerns expressed that New Zealand's legislative provisions did not fulfil the requirements of article 4 (b) of the Convention, the representative explained that although the Human Rights Act did not prohibit the establishment of racist organizations per se, its sections 61 and 63 made it unlawful for any organization to publish or distribute racist material and to engage in racial discrimination, while its section 131 covered the offence of inciting racial disharmony.
Therefore, the extent to which organizations with racist aims could promote them was clearly restricted.
426. With reference to article 5 of the Convention, and in connection with the subject of economic restructuring and its impact on employment and welfare, the representative explained that the New Zealand Employment Service did not use ethnicity as a criterion of eligibility for its services which were targeted at the most disadvantaged groups, including the long-term unemployed.
However, as Maori and Pacific Islanders were substantially over-represented among the latter group, they were in effect receiving targeted assistance.
In addition, there were two specific employment programmes for Maori and the Government had allocated $NZ 2.4 million to the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs to deliver employment services.
Moreover, in the context of the Government's reconsideration of policies to counter the effects of restructuring on vulnerable groups, changes had been introduced in December 1994 to increase the level of payments to purchase food in cases of emergency and hardship, to increase the level of grants for school uniforms and to provide grants to meet costs associated with the transition from receipt of benefit to resumption of employment.
Further adjustments and supplementary benefits which had been incorporated in the most recent budget were also outlined.
427. In reply to questions raised in relation to education, the representative stated that significant advances in the educational attainments of Maoris had been observed in the last five years which provided grounds for optimism about the future position of Maori in education.
In addition, the positive outcomes expected from Maori-medium education initiatives should in turn lead to more favourable opportunities for Maori in the labour market.
Moreover, the active promotion of the Maori language as a national language of New Zealand had inspired many New Zealanders to study it.
A small number of non-Maori adults were studying the language at tertiary institutions or in community education or work-based programmes.
Two Maori tertiary institutions already existed and a third was expected to be functioning by the end of 1995.
428. As regards the housing situation of Maori, the Committee was informed that 49 per cent of Maori were accommodated in rental housing as compared with 24 per cent of the New Zealand population as a whole.
The 1992 census had shown that renters tended to have lower incomes and to be young.
There was also a strong link to unemployment and a higher proportion of Maori were unemployed.
429. With regard to the recently introduced electoral reform and its impact on Maori representation, the representative explained that the number of guaranteed Maori seats in Parliament under the new system had been increased from four to five and that the number of Maori seats would rise or fall depending on the number of Maori opting for enrolment in the Maori roll at the end of the Maori option period.
He indicated that the new mixed-member proportional system also provided additional opportunities for Maori representation, where parties felt compelled to select Maori candidates for both "list" and "constituency" seats.
Equally, the new system would provide an opportunity for a party representing Maori interests to become established and win list seats in its own right.
Such opportunities, including for increased representation, also applied to other ethnic groups.
430. With respect to matters relating to immigration, the representative indicated that the Government was aware that there were some Maori concerns about immigration policies.
Improvements were being made to the collection of data to ensure the availability of more comprehensive information regarding the impact of immigration and to facilitate an informed public dialogue.
The Government was confident that its immigration policy was consistent with its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi and that Maori opinion had been fully taken into account when the new immigration policy had been developed.
The criteria for accepting immigrants were transparent and applied to all immigrants; the points system had been designed to establish an objective measure of the merits of all applicants.
431. In connection with article 6 of the Convention, the representative informed the Committee that anyone could lodge a complaint about alleged racial discrimination against himself or herself.
A complaint might also be made by one person on behalf of another as long as he was a relative or associate of the complainant.
There was no specific provision in the Human Rights Act for complainants representing group interests.
Moreover, by amendment to section 39 of the Employment Contracts Act, a complainant could choose the Act under which he wished to pursue a complaint.
However, a complaint could not be pursued under both the Employment Contracts Act and the Human Rights Act.
The personal grievance procedure provided for under the Employment Contracts Act was designed to encourage parties to resolve the complaint among themselves and the burden of proof in such cases depended on the nature of the claim.
For example, in cases of discrimination, where there could be no justification for an employer's conduct, it was the employee who must satisfy the Employment Tribunal or Employment Court that discrimination had occurred.
432. Additionally, the representative indicated that progress was also being made in the protection and promotion of the rights of ethnic minorities, particularly those of Maori and Pacific Island peoples, as well as in the recognition and prevention of harassment, especially of a racial nature.
Between 1 July 1994 and 30 June 1995 a total of 587 complaints had been received by the Race Relations Office. Of those, 40 per cent related to section 61 of the Human Rights Act.
In 1994/95 there had been 94 mediated settlements.
There had been one prosecution by the police under section 25 of the Race Relations Act 1971 in December 1993.
The police had decided in that case to prosecute under the Race Relations Act in order to demonstrate that they were prepared to take action on incitement to racial disharmony.
The Department of Justice took the view that the small number of prosecutions under what had become section 131 of the Human Rights Act was partly due to the fact that the police had other legislation under which they could deal with the relevant criminal activities, for example criminal damage or offensive behaviour.
433. Concerning article 7 of the Convention and matters raised with respect to the cases of ill-treatment in prisons, the representative indicated that he would provide information on the incidents at the Mount Crawford prison in the future.
However, with regard to the situation at the Mongora prison, he reported that the Ministry of Justice had held an independent inquiry into the management of the prison.
A report had been published, containing 60 recommendations for action, some applying specifically to Mongora while others were of relevance to the prison system as a whole.
All the recommendations contained in the report would be implemented by the end of 1995.
In addition, disciplinary procedures had been instituted against some prison officers and 17 had been suspended.
Inquiries into this incident continued to be pursued by the New Zealand police.
434. Moreover, the representative informed the Committee that while Maori constitute 10.6 per cent of the population aged 15 and over, Maori offenders accounted for just under half (49 per cent) of the cases which resulted in imprisonment in 1994.
Thus, there had been little change in recent years with regard to the proportion of offences committed by Maori.
He also indicated that although there was no specific focus in the provision of psychological services in prison for the adjustment of Maori as compared to other inmates, the Corrections Psychological Services Division was committed to enhancing its services to Maori generally and had undertaken a number of initiatives to that end.
A brief description of those initiatives was provided.
435. Concerning article 14 of the Convention, the Committee was informed that the Government of New Zealand was not considering making a declaration under this article, especially as it had accepted a broadly based complaints procedure under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Nor was it the intention of New Zealand to adhere to ILO Convention No. 169.
Consultations held in 1990 had revealed serious reservations about its provisions and resistance to its ratification.
436. Furthermore, the representative informed the Committee that he would submit written replies to the questions on the Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act and the question relating to the determination of ethnic identity.
In addition, he stated that the Committee's comments with respect to articles 4 (b) and 14 had been duly noted.
437. At its 1123rd meeting, held on 16 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
438. The comprehensive and detailed report prepared by the State party, especially in responding to requests for information raised during the Committee's previous dialogue with New Zealand, is noted with appreciation.
The highly informative introductory statement, made by the State party representative, providing detailed coverage of recent developments with regard to the implementation of the Convention is welcomed.
The open, constructive and detailed responses of the delegation to the questions raised by the members of the Committee are also commended.
The opportunity to continue a constructive and fruitful dialogue with the State party is particularly welcomed.
439. It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention, and some members requested that the possibility of such a declaration be considered.
440. It is noted that a number of legislative changes had been undertaken during the period under review.
Attention is drawn in particular to the adoption of the Human Rights Act 1993 which amalgamated the Race Relations Act and the Human Rights Commission Act.
441. During the reporting period, it is observed that other developments which have taken place include the establishment in 1991 of Te Puni Kokiri (the Ministry of Maori Development) which replaced the IMI Transition Agency and the Ministry of Maori Affairs; the strengthening of the Ministry of Pacific and Island Affairs; the establishment of the Ethnic Affairs Service within the Ministry of Internal Affairs; and the establishment of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs.
442. It is noted with satisfaction that New Zealand has decided to mark the first year of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People by designating 1995 as the Year of the Maori language.
The aim of the year being to encourage Maori and other groups and individuals to make an active commitment to learning and promoting the Maori language.
443. The introduction of new targeted policies and programmes in the fields of education, health, employment and social welfare to address the specific needs of Maori and ethnic minorities is welcomed.
444. In this regard, the Government's stated commitment to continue providing support for the improvement of education results for Maori is acknowledged.
The intention of the Government to develop policy to address disparities in the areas of secondary school retention, school truancy, achievement and attainment, participation in core subject areas and progression to further education and training is welcomed.
445. The efforts undertaken by the State party to address the high infant mortality rate in the Maori population are also welcomed.
Equally, the adoption of strategies by the Government to enable Maori and Pacific Island people to develop and deliver appropriate social services using traditional cultural approaches is appreciated.
446. It is noted with satisfaction that a Prime Ministerial Task Force on Employment was established in 1994 and that a multiparty memorandum of understanding was issued in June 1995 in response to the findings of the Task Force's report.
In this connection, it is noted that a number of programmes have recently been initiated to address the needs of unemployed Maori and a number of recommendations have been made regarding the employment issues affecting Pacific Island people.
447. Note is also taken of the Race Relations Office's recently completed research project undertaken on the subject of positive race relations in the country and the survey conducted to help identify the victims of racially motivated crime.
448. Tokelau's pursuance of the path towards self-government, with the possibility of adopting the status of free association with New Zealand, is noted.
449. Satisfaction is expressed at the practice instituted in the State party of publicizing the presentation of human rights reports.
It was further noted that the publications produced contain the report, opening statement, the questions raised and answers provided as well as the concluding observations of the Committee and are widely distributed throughout the country.
450. The Government acknowledges that there remains widespread concern among the Maori about the present proposals, especially the so-called "fiscal envelope" designed to settle Maori grievances and claims under the Treaty of Waitangi.
The Maori concern also extends to the issue of the compatibility of these proposals with the terms of the Treaty.
Concern is expressed that this problem remains unsettled.
451. Similar concerns are raised regarding the probable effects of the new immigration policy on racial harmony and the implementation of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement Act) 1992.
452. While the policy and special programmes to improve the situation of the Maori, Pacific Island and other ethnic minorities are commended, the existing social and economic disparities between the Maori and Pacific Islanders on the one hand and the Pakeha in New Zealand continue to be a matter of concern.
453. Concern is also expressed about the adequacy of the measures to implement article 4 (b) of the Convention.
454. The Committee wishes to receive further information on the proposal of the Government to implement changes to the Immigration Service's data collection and evaluation systems, and to make available more comprehensive information on the impacts of immigration and the situation of immigrants so as to further facilitate informed public dialogue with respect to New Zealand's immigration policies.
455. In view of the Government's declared commitment to address what are openly acknowledged to be difficult and challenging historic and contemporary issues, the Committee recommends that the State party continue to accord careful consideration to the concerns expressed about proposals to settle Maori grievances and land claims, including their compatibility with respect to the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi.
456. The Committee wishes to receive further information in the next report of the State party on the implementation of the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Settlement) Act 1992, the Te Ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act 1993 and the Electoral Act 1993.
457. It is suggested that the Government consider undertaking further measures with respect to the implementation of article 4 (b) of the Convention which requires States parties to declare illegal and prohibit organizations which promote and incite racial discrimination.
458. In line with the usual practice of the State party, the Committee recommends that the report, the discussion with, and the concluding observations adopted by, the Committee be widely publicized in New Zealand.
459. The Committee recommends that the State party's twelfth periodic report, due on 22 December 1995, be a brief updating report.
El Salvador
The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth periodic reports of El Salvador, submitted in one document (CERD/C/258/Add.1), were considered by the Committee at its 1108th and 1109th meetings, held on 4 and 7 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1108-1109).
The reports were introduced by a delegation from the State party, which stated that El Salvador was committed to the preservation of indigenous culture.
The State representative further explained that 12 years of civil war had impeded his country's submission of reports to the Committee during that time.
He assured the Committee that his country was eager to renew a constructive dialogue with the Committee and would henceforth submit reports in a timely manner.
The representative declared that the country had changed in only a few years.
The peace process that had begun with the signing of the Peace Accord of 1992 was irreversible. It was reinforced by the change from a military to a civilian police force and the establishment of the Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights.
The State had also benefited from the presence of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and the technical cooperation programmes of the Centre for Human Rights.
In the latter connection, El Salvador had received a human rights needs assessment mission from the Centre as part of its technical cooperation programmes in which a member of the Committee had participated.
With respect to human rights treaties, the representative explained that El Salvador had ratified the ILO Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111), the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957 (No. 107) and other regional and international human rights treaties.
With respect to the Convention, however, the representative stated that in El Salvador the phenomenon of racial discrimination did not exist.
All persons in El Salvador enjoyed equal rights, including indigenous people.
At the same time, he acknowledged that there was no precise demographic data on indigenous persons, but such persons were few and lived in small groups in dispersed settlements.
The Government had programmes that aimed to preserve and diffuse the indigenous languages.
Members of the Committee expressed appreciation for the resumption of the dialogue between the Committee and El Salvador.
Mention was made of the need to evaluate the report in the context of the civil war from which the State party was emerging and expressed appreciation for its efforts reflected in both the report and the core document.
Members agreed that the El Salvador of today was different from the El Salvador of only four years before and took note of the fact that, as part of the dialogue between the Government and the Frente Farabundo Mart√≠ para la Liberaci√≥n Nacional, an agreement on human rights was signed in 1990 at San Jos√©, containing the rights recognized by El Salvador in its Constitution and within the framework of the human rights instruments of the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
The agreement would be monitored by a human rights verification mission.
Members expressed concern that the report was incomplete and not in compliance with the Committee's guidelines for the preparation of State reports.
A member noted that paragraphs 6 to 49 of the report repeated the same information contained in the core document, which meant that the report itself consisted only of paragraphs 1 to 5 and 50 to 60.
Although many of their descendants had been assimilated into the mainstream society, there continued to exist small indigenous populations that maintained their traditional lifestyles.
These communities had limited access to employment and educational opportunities, limited possession of land titles and bank credit and other forms of economic opportunities.
The fact that the report failed to recognize the existence of these indigenous communities, and that these communities had been extremely marginalized, constituted a violation of the Convention and were matters of concern.
Consequently, the Committee member could not accept the assumption underlying the statement in the report that "in view of the fact that Salvadoran society does not have any problem of ethnic populations, the Government of El Salvador considers it irrelevant and unnecessary to refer to the operative part of the Convention ...".
A member referred to article 201 of the Constitution, which provided that "no educational establishment may refuse or admit students on the grounds of the nature of the union of their parents or guardians or of social, racial, or political difference".
He asked whether such a provision still existed, why there was no report thereon, what it meant in practice, whether it could be invoked in court and whether there were any court rulings in that respect.
With respect to article 1, paragraph 4, of the Convention, a member drew attention to the fact that there was no indication in the Constitution concerning the implementation of the provision.
With regard to article 4 of the Convention, it was further indicated that the core document referred to several institutions that were established for the protection of human rights, including the Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights.
A detailed explanation was requested of their functions, mandates, activities and relationships with the judiciary and Parliament.
A question was posed whether there had been any improvement in the situation of communities of former refugees repatriated from neighbouring countries, which apparently faced obstacles posed by the military with regard to supplies and freedom of movement.
A member drew attention to the fact that there was also no indication in the Constitution concerning the implementation of the guarantees contained in article 2 of the Convention, including whether the rights to life, personal security and ownership of property were enjoyed in practical terms.
It was also noted that no information was provided with respect to the implementation of article 5 of the Convention.
With respect to article 6, concern was expressed that politically motivated acts of violence continued to take place with impunity, since they were rarely followed by an official investigation.
In view of that situation, members expressed grave concern over the adoption of the Amnesty Law and the failure to exclude those who had violated human rights from serving in the military, the national police, the judiciary or other branches of Government.
It was asked whether any specific plans were in place for reparations, compensation and other action to guarantee that human rights violations would not be repeated.
Specific information was requested regarding the implementation of the right to effective remedy, as provided for in article 6 of the Convention.
In connection with article 7, it was also pointed out that while the report asserted that under the 1983 Constitution international treaties had force of law and could be invoked in court, it was not in the juridical culture of El Salvador to invoke international treaties.
It was asked whether this was not an indication of poor dissemination of information.
One member emphasized the importance of training law enforcement officials, on which the views of the Committee were elaborated in its General Recommendation 13.
The question was asked what actions had been taken towards such training and what influence such training had on the protection of human rights in the State party.
Information was requested concerning migratory movements, particularly of refugees, both from the State party in other countries and those seeking refuge in the State party from other countries.
It was suggested that the State party undertake a study of its obligations under articles 2 to 7 of the Convention.
Other members expressed the view that the civil war was all the more reason for stronger international supervision of the situation in the State party.
One member requested further explanation of article 406 of the Penal Code and requested information on what would happen in October when ONUSAL was to withdraw from the territory of the State party.
Members of the Committee also requested that the State party accept the amendment to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention regarding financing of the Committee and to submit its instrument of acceptance to the Secretary-General at an early date.
Some members recommended that the State party consider making a declaration of acceptance of article 14 to recognize the competence of the Committee to receive individual communications.
One member described his participation in a needs assessment mission to the State party at the end of May and early June.
The mission was organized by the Centre for Human Rights and took place within the framework of its technical cooperation programmes.
He explained that the independent expert on the human rights situation in El Salvador had recommended that the Commission end the process of monitoring and embark on the provision of advisory services. Advisory services were recommended with respect to the consolidation of the parliamentary process, reform of the organs of control over society, including the security forces and civil police, development of new laws and definition of the future role of the Procurator for Human Rights with regard to minorities.
The member explained that the mission was in response to the State's request for technical assistance, that the information obtained during the mission was currently being analysed by the Centre and that a report would be available when that analysis was concluded.
In response to the questions and comments of the members of the Committee, the representative of the State party stated that the civil war had impeded the fulfilment of its obligations under the Convention.
He confirmed that the article prohibiting racial discrimination had been maintained in the 1983 Constitution.
The representative explained that the statement in the report that El Salvador had no significant indigenous populations was due to methodological difficulties in identifying and assessing the situation of indigenous persons.
He stated that the characteristics used elsewhere to identify ethnic groups, such as special clothing, religious traditions or the use of native languages, were not evident in El Salvador.
He further explained that an intensive process of assimilation had been taking place since the Spanish conquest.
The representative stated that the Government was aware that indigenous populations existed and was making a concerted effort to preserve indigenous cultures and languages.
More attention would be paid to the process called transculturation as well as to appropriate methods of identifying indigenous persons, perhaps with the assistance of the Centre for Human Rights.
He pledged that a report would be submitted to the Committee in 1996 describing developments in those efforts.
With respect to article 4, the representative further stated that the provision in the Criminal Code which defined as an offence the incitement to hatred against specific groups had not been altered.
He agreed to provide information on the number of cases involving that provision after consulting the authorities.
There were no court cases invoking the Convention to date, but training for judges and lawyers on the use of international law was being provided by the Supreme Court.
In response to questions regarding the role of the public security forces in relation to articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, the representatives explained that a new Ministry of Public Security had been established in June 1995 and that the training of police was undertaken by the new Public Security Academy.
It was hoped that new disciplinary regulations for the National Civil Police would be approved within the month.
Further, action had been taken to accelerate the investigation of 117 cases of serious offences.
Regarding migratory movements, the representatives informed the Committee that approximately 200,000 persons had left the country to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
All had returned under a voluntary repatriation plan, which was recognized as successful by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
With respect to the withdrawal of ONUSAL, the representative responded that the withdrawal was a decision of the Security Council reflecting the belief that the peace process had become irreversible and now rested with the people and Government of El Salvador to continue.
A respected expert in human rights had been appointed as Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights; her office functioned with full powers to promote and protect human rights as provided for in article 194 of the Constitution and its implementing legislation.
It had already begun to receive complaints of human rights violations, a function previously performed by ONUSAL.
The Committee's observations had been noted and efforts would be made to include all the information requested by the Committee in the next periodic report.
At its 1124th meeting, held on 16 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
The submission of the third to eighth periodic reports of El Salvador, which were combined in a single document, is welcomed. Appreciation is expressed for the opportunity to re-establish the dialogue between the Committee and the State party since the consideration of the combined initial and second periodic report in 1984, as well as for the constructive nature of the discussion. Appreciation is also expressed for the oral answers which the delegation provided to questions raised by members of the Committee.
The Agreement establishes a basis for certain rights and freedoms being overseen by a human rights verification mission.
This development will reinforce action against racial discrimination.
It is noted with satisfaction that several institutions have been established with constitutional and legal authority to defend human rights, specifically the Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights, the Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights, the Department of Human Rights within the Supreme Court of Justice and the Commission on Justice and Human Rights under the Legislative Assembly.
Note is taken of the fact that, under the Constitution of 1983, international treaties, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, are granted a higher status than domestic law and may be invoked in the courts.
The State party's request for advisory services and technical cooperation from the Centre for Human Rights is noted with appreciation.
In this connection, it is also noted that the programme which has been organized for El Salvador contains important elements, including the strengthening of human rights institutions and education and training for officials involved in the protection of human rights.
These problems continue to impede its ability to monitor the fulfilment of the State party's responsibilities under the Convention.
The assertion of the State party that, because there are no physical distinctions between the indigenous population and the population as a whole, and because the number of indigenous persons is insignificant, no racial discrimination exists in the State, is not acceptable.
The Government's failure to acknowledge the existence of persons of indigenous ethnic origin makes it difficult for the Committee to evaluate the implementation of the Convention.
It is regretted that no references to the rights of indigenous persons are made in the Constitution, including their right to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions and the allocation of natural resources.
Deep concern is expressed at the lack of effort by the authorities to collect information regarding the situation of indigenous ethnic and other minorities which could serve as an indication of the practical implementation of the Convention, particularly when there appears to be clear evidence that the indigenous minorities live in conditions of extreme economic marginalization.
The Committee recommends that the State party actively foster a legal culture that effectively protects human rights by disseminating as widely as possible information on the international human rights treaties to which it is party, among the authorities responsible for the protection of human rights as well as among the general public.
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure effective coordination between the institutions established in the areas of human rights and requests detailed information in the next periodic report on the legal functions of these institutions, in particular the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights, their activities undertaken so far and the relationships with each other and with the judiciary and Parliament.
It specifically requests information in the ninth periodic report of the State party on the actual and envisaged roles of these institutions in the protection of the rights of indigenous and other minorities.
The Committee recommends that reliable quantitative and qualitative information be systematically collected and analysed to evaluate progress in the elimination of racial discrimination and to monitor closely the situation of marginalized persons and groups.
It recommends that detailed demographic information be submitted in the next periodic report on the categories of persons enumerated in article 1 of the Convention and in conformity with paragraph 8 of the Reporting Guidelines.
The Committee recommends that the State party request, as part of the technical cooperation programme currently being implemented in conjunction with the Centre for Human Rights, assistance with the collection of relevant information on the economic and social situation and the legal status of individuals belonging to ethnically distinguished groups in El Salvador, and with the preparation of reports to be submitted to the treaty bodies.
It suggests that the State party undertake a thorough review of its obligations under, and its own compliance with, articles 2 to 7 of the Convention.
It suggests that technical assistance may also be requested from the Committee in connection with such a review.
The Committee recommends that the State party ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
The Committee recommends that the State party's ninth periodic report, due on 30 December 1996, be a comprehensive report.
Nicaragua
The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth periodic reports of Nicaragua, submitted in one document (CERD/C/277/Add.1), were considered by the Committee at its 1110th and 1111th meetings, held on 7 and 8 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1110-1111).
The report was introduced by the representative of the State party, who referred to the tragic events that had affected his country, in particular the political struggles that had given rise to civil wars and dictatorships.
With the election in 1990 of Mrs. Chamorro, the candidate of a coalition of 14 political parties, Nicaragua had embarked on a process of transition towards economic and social reconstruction, strengthening of democracy and national reconciliation.
To that end, the main programmes being implemented by the authorities related to combating poverty, decentralization and encouraging the establishment of small- and medium-sized businesses.
The process was fraught with difficulties, however, due to the country's poor economic and social situation, with the highest rate of external indebtedness in the world, a very low GDP and a very high birth rate (3.7 per cent).
Article 5 of the 1987 Constitution, amended in 1995, enshrined the principle of political, social and ethnic pluralism, by recognizing for the first time the existence of indigenous populations who thus enjoyed constitutional rights and guarantees, in particular the right to preserve their identity and their culture, to adopt their own social structure and administer their local affairs and to maintain community forms of land ownership, enjoyment and use.
Article 121 of the Constitution stipulated that the indigenous populations of the Atlantic Coast regions were entitled to a multicultural education in their region.
Most of the ethnic groups in Nicaragua lived in the two Atlantic Coast regions and were composed chiefly of mestizos, Miskitos, Creoles, Sumus and Ramas.
Those regions were the least densely populated in the country, with a population that was 35 per cent urban and 40 per cent rural, with the rest living in scattered areas.
The legal system set up by the authorities in 1986 to protect the minorities in accordance with the Convention was described in detail in the report, in particular the relevant provisions of the Constitution and Act No. 28, the Autonomy Statute of the Atlantic Coast Regions of Nicaragua.
The latter provided for the establishment of Governments of the Autonomous Regions, comprising a Regional Council, a Regional Coordinator and municipal and communal authorities, with decision-making power regarding the use of natural resources.
Thanking the representative of Nicaragua for the additional information he had provided in introducing the report, the Committee expressed its satisfaction at the resumption of dialogue with Nicaragua, but noted with regret that the report did not contain specific information on the implementation of the anti-racial-discrimination legislation and the Convention.
The Committee reminded the representative of Nicaragua that regularity in submitting periodic reports under the Convention (every two years) was essential for an effective dialogue with the Committee.
Regarding the general part of the report, the members of the Committee requested more information on the composition and operation of the Nicaraguan Institute for the Development of the Autonomous Regions (INDERA) and up-to-date information on the indigenous populations, in particular their composition, geographic location and economic situation, throughout the territory of the country.
The members of the Committee pointed out that the report contained information on the ethnic minorities of the Atlantic Coast only and asked about the other minorities and indigenous groups living in Nicaragua, especially those on the Pacific coast.
They also asked about the status of international conventions, in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in Nicaraguan domestic law.
With regard to article 2 of the Convention, the members of the Committee asked for further information on the policies implemented to combat all forms of racial discrimination.
Concerning article 2, paragraph 2, they also asked for more information on the effective functioning and strengthening of the powers of the two Regional Councils set up by the 1987 Autonomy Statute, especially with regard to conservation and use of natural resources and to their degree of political and administrative autonomy with respect to the central government in Managua.
Information was also requested on the situation of the special fund for social development and progress provided for the two Autonomous Regions and on the amount of financial resources allocated annually by the central authorities to the operating budgets of the autonomous governments.
They also asked for further information on the draft legislation to be prepared, in consultation with the indigenous populations concerned, on the rational use and conservation of the natural resources of the autonomous regions.
The Committee noted that the information provided in connection with article 3 of the Convention was inadequate, inasmuch as practices identical to apartheid continued to exist in several parts of the world.
The members of the Committee therefore asked for additional information on the measures taken by the authorities under article 3 of the Convention.
Noting the lack of information on article 5 of the Convention in the report, the Committee asked for additional information on the steps taken to implement that article, in particular the measures adopted, and their application, to ensure the equality of all before the law and the exercise of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights by everyone, without discrimination.
Concerning article 6 of the Convention, the members of the Committee asked for explanations of the steps taken by the authorities to facilitate the return and resettlement of the members of indigenous groups who had fled to Honduras and Costa Rica during the hostilities, in particular long-term measures; they also asked for information on the functioning of the judicial bodies in the Autonomous Regions and on the administration of justice in general in those regions, which according to article 18 of the Autonomy Statute was governed by special regulations.
They also asked what remedies were available in cases of racial discrimination.
Information was also requested on the establishment of the Human Rights Advocate and on his powers and functions.
In connection with article 7 of the Convention, the members of the Committee asked what were the "cases specified by law" in which, according to article 11 of the Constitution, "the languages of the communities of the Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua shall also be used officially". Since the relationship of the indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Coast with their land was basic to their culture, the members of the Committee asked what was the area of the inalienable lands of those groups and requested details of the provisions governing the mineral resources found on them.
In response to the questions and comments by members of the Committee, it was said by the representative of the State party that the Nicaraguan Institute for the Development of the Autonomous Regions had recently been disbanded, first because its main function, to bridge the gap between the national Government and the Atlantic Coast autonomous regions, was no longer relevant as regional governments and councils had been consolidated, and secondly because the management of the Institute was primarily handled by representatives of the Misquito community, thus leading to discontent among the members of other ethnic groups who felt they were not adequately represented.
He said that there were various indigenous communities in the Pacific coast regions, with populations of between 14,000 and 28,000 inhabitants, but in general those indigenous populations had been assimilated into the local community, thereby losing their traditional cultures and customs.
Responding to specific questions regarding the exploitation of natural resources in the autonomous regions, the representative of the State party said that the central Government issued the licences, which were subject to the approval of the Regional Councils.
The regional territory could not be yielded without the prior approval of the Regional Councils, the resulting disputes between the State and the Regional Councils being dealt with by the Supreme Court of Justice.
The representative added that concerning the bilingual inter-ethnic education programme, teachers, instructors and leaders and representatives of indigenous communities were directly involved in its implementation, which had covered 13,000 children between pre-school age and the fourth grade of primary school, in 1992.
A bilingual teacher-training centre had been set up in Puerto Cabezas in the North Atlantic Coast region.
He added that in the autonomous regions, the languages spoken by the indigenous communities were used officially in the administrative organs of the regions, in addition to Spanish; translations of employment contracts and collective agreements must be guaranteed and all staff involved in the administration of justice and law enforcement officials must be able to understand the languages spoken by all parties involved in a dispute.
In the field of technical education, the Nicaraguan Institute of Technology and a number of indigenous organizations had organized between 40 and 50 courses aimed at job creation and the enhancement of technical skills, particularly for the benefit of demobilized persons, returnees and women heads of household, in about 60 indigenous communities.
Some 300 people had participated in workshops designed to encourage the launching of small-scale projects and micro-enterprises.
The representative said that his Government had allocated funds through the Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), which had been promoting the development of economic and social infrastructures such as bridges, roads, waterways, educational buildings and health centres and in reforestation programmes.
The Nicaraguan Institute of Energy, with foreign assistance, had invested US$ 5 million in the previous two years in new electric power plants designed to improve energy distribution in urban centres such as Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas.
Regarding tourism in the autonomous regions, the Ministry of Tourism was preparing cultural and environment-friendly tourism programmes, in which members of the communities were trained to run the projects, and advisory services were available for the launching of community-based initiatives.
The representative said that a Commission on Ethnic Affairs and Indigenous Communities had been set up in the National Assembly, all its members being from the indigenous population; this Commission had prepared the Nicaraguan Plan of Action for the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, comprising several themes and activities each year until the year 2004.
At the same time, the representative emphasized that it was impossible to redress in such a short period of time the consequences of civil wars, foreign occupation, dictatorship, natural disasters and negligence on the part of the central authorities.
Concerning Nicaraguan involvement in the international and interregional protection of the rights of minorities, the representative said that Managua was the headquarters of the Indigenous Parliament of America, which recently held the eleventh Inter-American Indigenous Congress, during which the Managua Declaration was adopted; the Declaration noted the urgency of recognizing the tenure of land belonging to the continent's indigenous populations, of establishing coordinating machinery between States and indigenous populations to facilitate decision-making on matters concerning those populations, and of involving indigenous peoples in all aspects of political, legal, economic and social life.
Nicaragua had actively participated in the activities of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities since its establishment in 1982 and it also supported the drafting of a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.
The Committee thanked the representative for the supplementary information provided, but noted that the delegation had failed to explain how it was complying with article 4 of the Convention.
Appreciation is expressed for the resumption of the dialogue between Nicaragua and the Committee, and for the detailed and frank report submitted by the State party.
It is, however, regretted that the report provided insufficient factual information, especially with regard to the implementation of the Convention and the related domestic legislation.
The delegation which presented the report is commended for the useful additional information provided orally, in response to the questions raised and comments made by the Committee members, and its commitment to provide the Committee with written answers is most welcome.
The armed conflict raging in the country during the past decade, in which the indigenous populations were, willingly or unwillingly, used as political, military and strategic tools, dominated the overall human rights picture of the country, and still has some consequences for the full enjoyment of human rights by all Nicaraguans, together with the political problems of governance and economic crisis, which still persist.
It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention, and some members of the Committee requested that the possibility of such a declaration be considered.
The Constitution of 1987, which recognizes for the first time the multi-ethnic character of the Nicaraguan population and grants to all persons the enjoyment of the rights proclaimed in various international and regional instruments, is welcomed.
Other encouraging developments include the provisions of the same constitution and of Act No. 28 of 1987, known as the Autonomy Statute, which establishes a special regime of autonomy for two regions of the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua where most of the ethnic minorities and the indigenous groups live.
The Autonomy Statute recognizes and guarantees, among other things, the communal form of land ownership of the peoples of the two autonomous regions and their right to education in their own language.
The Committee welcomes the constitutional amendments of 1995, especially the provisions which emphasize the ethnic pluralism of Nicaragua and reinforce the rights of the indigenous populations and other ethnic groups of the Atlantic coast, including the right of the regional councils to approve agreements for the exploitation of their natural resources.
The adoption of the Amparo Act in 1988, providing for the right to habeas corpus in the constitutional, administrative and criminal spheres, and the statement made in the report that cultural, social and other factors are taken into account when members of the indigenous communities are tried, are both welcomed.
Note is taken with appreciation of articles 549 and 550 of the Criminal Code, inspired by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
It is noted with appreciation that efforts are being made by the authorities to set up a multilingual education system in favour of the indigenous communities, and that, in accordance with Act No. 162, indigenous languages besides Spanish are of official use in the autonomous regions.
The establishment in the constitutional reforms of 1995 of the Office of Human Rights Ombudsman to inquire into human rights violations and to monitor the implementation of international human rights instruments ratified by Nicaragua, such as the Convention, is welcomed.
The efforts made by the State party, in cooperation with the United Nations, to arrange the repatriation and the resettlement of the Miskitos, Sumus and Creoles who fled to neighbouring countries during the civil conflict, are commended.
Concern is expressed as to the status of the Convention in the domestic legal order of Nicaragua and the lack of information about this in the report and during the oral presentation.
It is noted with concern that the State party has not implemented the provisions of article 4 of the Convention, which call for the adoption of positive measures and specific penal legislation to combat racial discrimination.
The realization of economic and social rights is a matter of continuous concern, in particular as the so-called structural adjustment measures and the privatization of State property have had negative consequences on the enjoyment of the economic, social and cultural rights of the Nicaraguan people, especially on its most vulnerable sectors and among them the indigenous communities.
It is regretted that insufficient information was provided on the implementation of articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, in particular on specific provisions of the domestic legislation adopted to implement these articles and on the number of complaints of racial discrimination brought before the courts.
Concern is expressed at the ratio of communal land to private land in the autonomous regions, with particular regard to the mining rights and at inequalities in the sharing of the benefits of the exploitation of natural resources in the autonomous territories between the regional and the central authorities.
Further concern is expressed at the lack of adequate consultation with the regional authorities in the decision-making process by the central authorities, thus leading to insufficient participation of the indigenous groups in decisions affecting their land and the allocation of the natural resources of their land, their cultures and their traditions.
The Committee recommends that the State party implement the obligations under the provisions of article 4 of the Convention.
In view of the importance of measures in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information to combat prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnical groups, the Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary measures in those fields in accordance with article 7 of the Convention.
The Committee recommends that, in its policy-making on matters relating to racial discrimination at large, the Government take into account the general recommendations adopted by the Committee, including those relating to the establishment of a national commission for the purpose of facilitating the aims and purposes of the Convention (general recommendation XVII (42)) and to the training of law enforcement officers (general recommendation XIII (42)).
The Committee recommends that the State party's tenth periodic report, due on 17 March 1997, be a comprehensive report.
United Arab Emirates
The Committee considered the eleventh periodic report of the United Arab Emirates (CERD/C/279/Add.1) at its 1113th meeting, on 9 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1113).
The report was introduced by the representative of the State party, who asked the Committee to excuse his Government's absence from the Committee's work for a number of years and the late submission of the periodic report, which was due to external circumstances and to administrative factors.
He recalled that his country was a young country, which had not gained its independence until 2 December 1971.
He explained that the Constitution and a number of legislative provisions, some of them enacted under the British Protectorate, guaranteed all persons within the territory of the United Arab Emirates freedom of opinion and expression, religious freedom and the right of appeal to the courts if those rights were violated.
Foreign communities in the United Arab Emirates had the right to open private schools providing instruction in their own language and according to their own methods.
In 1980, a labour relations act had been adopted.
The United Arab Emirates had also ratified a number of ILO Conventions such as Conventions Nos. 1, 29, 81 and 89.
In 1981, Act No. 20 had been adopted, guaranteeing the freedom to form occupational associations without State interference.
The United Arab Emirates also provided considerable development cooperation assistance, in particular to Africa.
The members of the Committee welcomed the presence of a high-level delegation to re-establish the dialogue on the implementation of the Convention in the State party.
They noted with regret, however, the long delay in submitting the periodic report, which was the first since 1986.
They also pointed out that there were many gaps in the report, particularly with regard to statistics on the composition of the population and the socio-economic situation of the various population groups, and that it had not been drawn up according to the Committee's guidelines for the preparation of reports.
However, some of those gaps had been filled in by the delegation's oral explanations.
The members of the Committee asked for a more detailed explanation than was given in the Government's report regarding the status of the Convention in the internal legal order.
One obvious deficiency noted concerned the application of article 4 of the Convention.
Although offending against religious beliefs and defamation were punishable, it was difficult to treat such offences as racist propaganda or incitement to racial discrimination.
Consequently, the members of the Committee urged the Government to review its legislation and ensure that it was in conformity with article 4 of the Convention.
With regard to the application of article 5 of the Convention, members of the Committee asked to what extent foreign workers - who, according to some sources, made up 80 per cent of the total labour force - were entitled to have their children join them and to have them educated in their own language, and whether those children were free to practise their religion.
They also asked which countries had bilateral agreements with the United Arab Emirates regarding the status of foreign workers and what was the content of those agreements.
The members of the Committee expressed their deep concern at information from various sources that foreign workers, particularly women from Asian countries, were subjected to inhuman treatment, and asked for clarification in that regard.
They also asked whether aliens living in the United Arab Emirates had the right to assemble freely and practise their culture.
The members of the Committee asked about the current situation of the four Indian citizens living in the United Arab Emirates who had been sentenced to imprisonment by the authorities for having insulted Islam in a theatrical performance given by an Indian association in 1992.
They also asked about the situation of the three aliens arrested in 1993 for anti-Islamic activities.
Clarification was requested regarding the remedies available to victims of racist acts: were such offences dealt with by the secular or Islamic courts? Could the Convention be invoked directly by individuals before the Islamic courts? Had the Convention ever been invoked before any court?
Replying to the Committee's questions and observations, the representative of the State party said that the Committee would be provided with full statistics and written replies to some of its questions.
Regarding the status of the Convention in the internal legal order, under article 120 of the Constitution, the President of the Federal Supreme Council approved international instruments by decree, and any decree approving an international treaty was enforceable and could be invoked before the courts like any other law.
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination had thus far never been invoked before a court.
With regard to article 4 of the Convention, the delegation assured the Committee that it would endeavour to encourage the legislature to enact special legislation implementing that article.
With regard to article 5, the representative of the State party explained that, with the exception of political matters and the acquisition of nationality, aliens living in the United Arab Emirates enjoyed the same rights as nationals.
Resumption of the dialogue with the State party, which had submitted no report since 1986, and the presence of a high-level delegation are noted with satisfaction.
Note is also taken of the quality of the dialogue and the constructive spirit of the delegation.
It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention, and members of the Committee requested that consideration should be given to the possibility of making that declaration.
The legislation adopted in accordance with the Convention since the last periodic report was submitted, in particular that concerning the right of foreign communities established in the territory of the State party to open private schools for teaching in their mother tongue and that concerning labour relations, is noted with satisfaction.
Appreciation is also expressed for the useful information presented orally by the delegation, including the promise that consideration would be given to introducing legislation to implement article 4 of the Convention.
Note is also taken of the readiness of the delegation to submit to its Government the concerns of the Committee with regard to certain inadequacies in the legislation.
Owing to the inadequacy of the information contained in the report of the State party concerning legislative, judicial, administrative or other measures taken to give effect to the Convention, the Committee is unable to form an exact idea of the progress achieved in implementing the Convention.
It is noted with concern that the provisions of article 4 of the Convention are not reflected in the country's national legislation.
It is recalled in this connection that penal legislation should contain specific provisions against racist acts.
Although information was provided on mother-tongue education and on access to health and work, more information is needed about the implementation of other aspects of article 5 of the Convention.
Keen concern was expressed as to the allegations of ill-treatment of foreign workers, including women domestic servants of foreign origin.
The delegation clarified certain aspects of this question, which should nevertheless be given special attention.
The information provided by the State party regarding effective remedies against any acts of racial discrimination is insufficient.
The Committee requests the Government of the State party to provide in its next report the information whose absence or insufficiency has been noted.
The Committee recommends that the State party discharge all the obligations set out in article 4 of the Convention.
The Government should to that end take into account the Committee's General Recommendation XV.
The Committee recommends that the State party show the utmost diligence in preventing acts of ill-treatment being committed against foreign workers, especially foreign women domestic servants, and take all appropriate measures to ensure that they are not subjected to any racial discrimination.
The Committee recommends that the State party ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, as adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
The Committee recommends that the twelfth periodic report of the State party, due on 21 July 1997, be comprehensive.
United Republic of Tanzania
At its 1112th meeting, on 9 August 1995, the Committee examined the implementation of the Convention by the United Republic of Tanzania on the basis of the previous report of the State party (CERD/C/131/Add.11), its consideration by the Committee (CERD/C/SR.817) and the oral information provided by the representative of the State party (see CERD/C/SR.1112).
The members of the Committee welcomed the important changes that have taken place in the last several years, such as the entry into force of the amended Constitution, providing for a multi-party system, and the scheduling of the first multi-party elections for October this year.
They also noted that some political and economic reforms were introduced in the country, in particular in the agricultural sector, with the aim of stimulating the overall economic growth.
It was noted that, though the Government asked in 1994 for the postponement of the submission of its eighth to eleventh periodic reports until the information on the recent substantive changes that occurred in the country were incorporated, no report had yet been received by the Committee.
This meant that the United Republic of Tanzania had not fulfilled its obligation under article 9, paragraph 1, of the Convention.
However, the presence of a representative of the State party to participate in the discussion with the Committee and the oral information he gave and the comprehensive answers provided to the questions raised by Committee members was a welcome sign that the United Republic of Tanzania wished to continue its dialogue with the Committee.
It was observed that numerous ethnic communities lived in the United Republic of Tanzania, together with a large minority of Asians, though the latter seems to decrease in number.
Questions were asked about the treatment of people having originally come from Zanzibar to the mainland.
The official position of the Government was also noted that the Tanzanian nation has been "welded together", as stated in the State party's seventh periodic report (CERD/C/131/Add.11, para. 6).
It was also noticed that the important number of refugees coming from neighbouring countries Rwanda and Burundi, this number amounting to 1.4 million according to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, created difficulties for the authorities, especially as regards their accommodation in the United Republic of Tanzania and their repatriation to their countries.
It was noted that there seemed to be some problems, mainly involving Christians and Muslims coming from different ethnic communities, relating to allegations that favouritism is being shown by the authorities towards one community, in the civil service, government posts and positions, State-owned businesses and scholarships.
The discussion underlined the concern about the availability of free access to courts and legal remedies in cases of alleged racial discrimination.
It was stressed that the State party had not implemented the provisions of articles 4 and 6 of the Convention, which call for the adoption of positive measures to combat racial discrimination.
(a) Principal subjects of concern
Concern was expressed at information about the cases of the expropriation of the lands of members of the Massa√Ø and the Baraba√Øg communities, within the framework of the agricultural reforms undertaken by the Government.
Concern was expressed at the absence of provisions in the domestic legislation designed to implement the provisions of article 4 (a) and (b) of the Convention, and also about how the Convention as a whole was being implemented by the State party in its national legal system.
It was noted with concern that there were reports alleging that the Asians in the United Republic of Tanzania suffer racial discrimination, and that there were statements of discrimination between the Christian and the Muslim communities giving rise to certain concern inasmuch as it was based on ethnic differences.
(b) Suggestions and recommendations
The Committee recommends that the State party in its report provide information as to which measures it has taken to effectively implement the Convention in its national legal system.
The Committee recommends that the State party include in its next periodic report information on the changes that occurred in the recent period of time within Tanzanian political and legal order and the society at large, possibly on the demographic composition of the population in the United Republic of Tanzania, on the introduction of legislation to combat racial discrimination in accordance with article 4, and on the means available to victims of human rights violations to obtain justice and reparation in accordance with article 6 of the Convention.
The Committee suggests that the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania avail itself of the technical assistance which the Committee can offer under the advisory services and technical assistance programme of the Centre for Human Rights.
Sierra Leone
587. At its 1116th meeting, held on 10 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1115), the Committee reviewed the implementation of the Convention by Sierra Leone based upon its previous reports (CERD/C/R.30/Add.43 and 46 and CERD/C/R.70/Add.22) and their consideration by the Committee (see CERD/C/SR.153, 159, 161, 204 and 215), together with the Committee's previous review at its 921st meeting, on 8 August 1991 (see CERD/C/SR.921 and A/46/18, paras. 279-282).
The Committee once more noted that no reports had been received from the State party since 1974.
588. Members of the Committee once more recalled, in connection with those previous reports, that the Committee had considered them to be insufficient, that section 13 (4) (g) of the Constitution then in force had been deemed incompatible with article 1 (3) of the Convention and that the Committee had requested the Government to submit additional information on the implementation of the Convention.
589. The Committee understands that according to section 27 of the 1991 Constitution "no law shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect", that this provision covers differential treatment "attributable wholly or mainly to their respective descriptions by race, tribe, sex, place of origin, political opinions, colour or creed", but that this provision "shall not apply" to any law "for the limitation of citizenship".
590. Members concluded that it would not be useful to reopen discussion on the basis of the previous reports, but that a communication should be sent to the State noting that an important question had been outstanding since 1974 and requesting information about constitutional and other developments.
591. The Committee regrets that Sierra Leone had not responded to its invitation to participate in the meeting and to furnish relevant information.
In concluding the review, the Committee decides that a communication should be sent to the Government of the reporting State setting out its reporting obligations under the Convention and urging that dialogue with the Committee should be resumed as soon as possible.
592. The Committee suggests that the Government of Sierra Leone avail itself of the technical assistance offered under the advisory services and technical assistance programme of the Centre for Human Rights.
Somalia
593. At its 1114th meeting, on 10 August 1995, the Committee reviewed the implementation of the Convention by Somalia (see CERD/C/SR.1114), after having recalled that at its 949th meeting it had decided to defer further consideration of the situation in that country. 7/
594. Members regretted that no new report was available to them and that no State representative was present.
595. Members deplored the prevailing lack of protection for human rights in Somalia.
They called on the Somali people to put an end to their conflicts and to work for national reconciliation.
Members regretted that, despite the advice of some regional organizations, the international community had ceased its attempts to restore peace.
They expressed appreciation for the continuing contributions of humanitarian organizations.
Finally, members hoped that the General Assembly would call on the Security Council and all States to halt the supply of arms to the contending parties.
596. The Committee decided to reconsider the situation in Somalia again at its forty-ninth session in August 1996, by which time it hoped to receive additional information from other United Nations bodies in touch with developments in the country.
Madagascar
597. At its 1115th meeting, held on 10 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1115) the Committee commenced its review of the implementation of the Convention by Madagascar based on its previous report (CERD/C/149/Add.19) and the consideration thereof by the Committee (see CERD/C/SR.835).
The Committee noted that no new report had been received since 1989.
The Committee received a request from the Government of Madagascar to defer the review from the forty-seventh to a future session.
That request was accepted on the understanding that the report would be submitted in time for it to be considered at the forty-eighth session of the Committee.
It was decided to have transmitted to the Government a list of the Committee's principal concerns with regard to implementation of the Convention in Madagascar, and to inform the Government that the Committee expected that the issues listed would be adequately addressed in the report to be submitted.
The Committee also recommended to the Government that it request technical assistance from the Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.
598. The thirteenth periodic report of Nigeria (CERD/C/263/Add.3 and CERD/C/283) was considered by the Committee at its 1114th and 1116th meetings, held on 10 and 11 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1114 and 1116).
599. The report was introduced by the representative of the State party who said that one of the major tasks facing the present administration which assumed power in November 1993 was the restoration of law and order among the diverse cultural, ethnic and linguistic groups existing in Nigeria.
In doing so, the administration ensured that the fundamental human rights enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution of 1979 were not unduly tampered with.
It also intended to announce a programme of transition to democratic rule on 1 October 1995.
The representative also referred to the ethnic composition of his country and to the constitutional provisions devoted to the recognition, promotion and enforcement of the rights of groups and individuals.
He stated that the Federal Government had made provision for direct funding of the Local Government Councils, that it had established an Oil Mineral-Producing Areas Development Commission and that the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Decree of 1995 was designed to attract foreign investment into the country.
600. The representative further referred to measures taken by its Government in the educational field and for the advancement of women, and stated that under Section 39 of the 1979 Constitution, Nigerian citizens were guaranteed the enjoyment of political and civil rights without discrimination.
The various rights enshrined in the Constitution were justiciable and many Nigerians sought redress in the courts of law when those rights were violated.
They were entitled to legal aid to initiate proceedings.
Finally, he stated that measures to ensure compliance with article 7 of the Convention included the establishment of the Technical Aid Corps Programme of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whereby young graduates volunteered to serve in developing countries for a given period.
601. Members of the Committee expressed appreciation for the readiness of the State party to continue the dialogue with the Committee, for its timely submission of the report, and for the high level of representation participating in the discussion.
It was observed, however, that Nigeria's reporting record showed a lack of continuity in that questions asked in connection with one report had not been answered in subsequent reports.
In addition, the Committee had received considerable information on the legal framework but rather little on actual practice; it was stressed that, in reporting, States parties should go beyond a list of legislative measures and should provide information on their application in practice.
602. In connection with article 1 of the Convention, members of the Committee took note of the difficulties encountered by the Federal Government of Nigeria in its efforts to promote harmony among the 250 ethnic groups living in the country, and welcomed the special measures taken or planned by the Government in that regard.
They also noted that section 39 (1) of the 1979 Nigerian Constitution provided for the protection of citizens against discrimination, but did not cover non-citizens or provide protection against discriminatory actions or practices outside the governmental sector.
In addition, it was observed that it was not clear which constitutional provisions were currently in force.
603. With regard to article 2 of the Convention, reference was made to numerous allegations of discrimination and other violations of human rights on grounds of ethnic origin which had been brought to the attention of the Committee by non-governmental organizations.
According to those allegations, the Nigerian security forces would have committed a series of human rights abuses, including killings, torture and massive arrests, particularly against the Ogoni ethnic group; the Federal Government was alleged to have fomented ethnic antagonism and to tolerate a situation of impunity with respect to the perpetration of human rights abuses.
It was therefore asked whether there had been any investigation on whether in Ogoniland unlawful orders had been given, what measures the Government had taken to consult ethnic groups about their grievances, whether there was a problem of "tribalism" in the country and, if so, what policy the Government was undertaking to mitigate it.
Detailed information was also requested on the action taken recently against the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People and, in particular, against Mr. Ken Saro-Wiva, leader of the Movement arrested in May 1994, and against other members of the Movement arrested in August 1995.
In addition, further details were requested as to how national integration was being actively encouraged, how the Government viewed the aspirations of the various ethnic groups and the movements for their survival and what it was doing or intended to do to accommodate their views.
It was further asked what measures were being taken to preserve the identity of the ethnic groups affected by the changes and deterioration of their environment, how the distribution of revenue was actually regulated and why the benefits from the use of natural resources were not equitably shared among the population as a whole and, more particularly, among the people from whose land they were extracted.
It was also asked why the Nigerian Government had refused to authorize a non-governmental organization to conduct an investigation into the situation in Ogoniland in 1994.
It was pointed out, in this connection, that a glaring discrepancy existed between information on the situation in Nigeria contained in the report and that provided by reliable non-governmental sources.
604. With reference to article 3 of the Convention, members of the Committee acknowledged the leading role of Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid and in its dismantling.
In this connection, information was requested on what Nigeria was currently doing at the international level to honour its commitment to combat racial discrimination, and, in particular, to provide assistance in many areas of Africa for the solution of ethnic conflicts.
605. With regard to article 4 of the Convention, members of the Committee pointed out that specific penal provisions should be enacted by Nigeria in order to fully comply with the provisions of that article, and that precise information on the progress made in this regard should be included in Nigeria's next periodic report.
It was asked, in particular, whether the Government had concluded its review of how to unify the Criminal Code that operated in the south and the Penal Code that operated in the north of the country, what was the status of the Convention in Nigerian domestic law and whether its articles could be invoked directly before the court.
606. With reference to article 5 of the Convention it was asked how the verdict was determined in criminal trials, whether there were complaints of ethnic bias in court proceedings, whether threats were ever made to the security of persons because of their ethnic origin and how effective was the remedy obtained in the case of discrimination in general, and discrimination in employment, in particular.
More information was requested on the establishment and functioning of civil disturbances special tribunals to try certain types of offences, the judgements of which were without appeal.
It was observed that because there was no avenue of appeal from the decisions of such tribunals their operation might infringe the right to equal treatment provided for by article 5 (a) of the Convention.
Information was also requested on the reply of the Nigerian Government to the International Labour Organization with regard to the expulsion of Chadian workers, and on any measures that prohibit political activities and limit press freedom.
Information was further requested on any plans affecting ethnic relations that might feature in the restoration of civilian rule.
607. Referring to article 6 of the Convention, members of the Committee wished to receive examples of judgements passed in application of section 39 of the 1979 Constitution relating to measures to combat racial discrimination.
They also wished to know more about the circumstances in which persons had applied to a court for the redress of alleged violations of fundamental human rights, what action the Government had taken in that regard, and what was the relationship between the Federal Court of Appeal and the Shariah Court of Appeal.
Information was requested on the Legal Aid Scheme and the modifications made in it.
In addition, members of the Committee wished to receive details of decrees, other enactments and court rulings relating to the punishment of violations of civil liberties and acts of racial discrimination and description of remedies available.
608. With regard to article 7 of the Convention, members of the Committee wished to know how, in practice, law enforcement officials were trained to face situations of ethnic conflict, how ethnic discrimination was avoided in their recruitment and whether they were given training in the area of human rights and the prevention of discrimination.
They also wished to know how the Government intended to foster the idea of tolerance, responsibility and cooperation among ethnic groups and what was the legal status of associations representing ethnic groups.
609. In their replies, the representatives of Nigeria stated that the allegations of human rights violations perpetrated by the security forces against the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People in general were groundless.
Those members of the Movement who had been arrested were charged with criminal offences.
They were part of a group which had transformed the originally peace-loving and constitutionally minded Movement into a violent one.
No representatives of any organization, national or international, had been prevented from visiting Ogoniland.
With regard to the question on revenue distribution, the representatives indicated that the trend was for the Federal Government's share of revenue to decrease while that of States and local governments increased.
They also referred to various measures introduced by the Government to minimize environmental degradation in the areas where hydrocarbons were extracted.
610. With regard to article 4 of the Convention, the representatives referred to the committee set up by the Federal Government to review and reform the Criminal Code and assured the Committee that it would be informed of the results of the review and reform procedure.
611. Referring to article 5 of the Convention, the representatives enumerated the fundamental human rights enshrined in the 1979 Constitution which had not been suspended under military rule.
They also stated that the establishment of the civil disturbances Special Tribunal had been prompted by the level of damage and the nature of the crimes committed in the north of the country.
They added that the rights of the defendant were the same in all tribunals without exception.
The representatives further stated that political associations recently created would have an opportunity to transform themselves into political parties in preparation for future elections, and that freedom of the press was guaranteed in the country.
612. With reference to article 6 of the Convention, the representatives indicated that under the 1979 Constitution a Public Complaints Committee and a Code of Conduct Bureau had been established, both of which were still operating and had authority to enforce their decisions.
The Public Complaints Committee had wide powers to deal with allegations of unfair treatment of members of the public by civil servants as well as grievances concerning both public and private enterprises and employers.
613. At its 1125th meeting, held on 17 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
614. The will and the readiness of the State party to continue the dialogue with the Committee are welcomed. The regularity of the submission of reports by the State party, in accordance with article 9 (1) of the Convention is appreciated.
The attendance of a high-level delegation and the further information submitted are also welcomed.
615. It is noted that the State party has not made the declaration provided for in article 14, and some members requested that the possibility of such a declaration be considered.
616. The recognition by the delegation of the existence in Nigeria of more than 250 groups distinguished by ethnic origin and the preoccupation of the Government to assure harmonious and peaceful relations between these groups are well noted.
617. The leading part played by Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid is acknowledged with satisfaction.
618. The Nigerian educational programmes which implement the provisions of article 7 of the Convention are welcomed.
619. Since some ethnic tensions have been associated with ecological changes, the Committee welcomed the statement on the action taken to ameliorate the ecological and developmental situation in the oil-producing areas of the country, including the establishment of the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission and the direct allocation of compensatory payments.
620. Concern is expressed that the record of Nigeria's reporting shows that many questions raised in connection with previous reports have not been fully answered in subsequent reports.
621. It is noted that not all the grounds of discrimination listed in article 1 (1) of the Convention are covered by the Constitution and legislation of the State party.
622. Concern is expressed at the delay in introducing legislation in implementation of the provisions of article 4 of the Convention.
623. Concern is expressed that while the report and the further information describe the legal framework for action against racial discrimination, little is said about the implementation in practice of the relevant provisions.
624. Concern is expressed that in circumstances such as those of Nigeria, in which political and religious differences may easily be associated with ethnic differences, any breakdown in law and order can exacerbate ethnic tension.
625. Concern is expressed about allegations that agents of the Government have contributed to ethnic antagonisms in the course of attempts to maintain law and order, particularly in the Rivers State.
626. Concern is expressed about the training of law enforcement officials in accordance with the Committee's General Recommendation XIII.
627. Particular concern is expressed that Decree 12 (Federal Military Government Supremacy and Enforcement Decree, 1994), stating that "no act of the federal military government may be questioned henceforth in a court of law" and which ousts "courts of jurisdiction", can adversely affect proceedings invoking protection against racial discrimination.
628. Particular concern is also expressed that trial by Special Tribunals, some of them with no right of appeal, could counter the right to equality before the law, without distinction as to ethnic origin, in accordance with article 5 of the Convention.
629. The Committee recommends that in its next periodic report the State party should describe the actions it has taken against individuals or groups which cause disaffection against ethnic groups and to defend the rights of their members.
630. The Committee recommends that in the course of its current review of its legislation, the Government give the necessary attention to measures designed to meet the requirements of articles 1 (1) and 4 of the Convention.
631. The Committee recommends that the Government review the effectiveness of the protection it provides against racial discrimination in the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in accordance with article 5 of the Convention.
632. The Committee recommends that the State party investigate situations of ethnic disorder and the causes thereof, including any possible unlawful orders, with a view to taking the necessary remedial measures in accordance with the Convention and to ensure that no one can act with impunity in these circumstances.
633. The Committee recommends that the Government, when promoting projects of economic development, undertake the necessary measures to effectively protect the identity of ethnic groups in the areas concerned.
634. The Committee recommends that the Government review the effectiveness of the recourse measures which should be available to all persons within their jurisdiction in accordance with article 6.
635. The Committee recommends that the State party ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention, adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
636. The Committee recommends that the State party's fourteenth periodic report, due on 5 January 1996, be submitted in due time.
Chad
637. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth periodic reports of Chad, grouped together to form a single document (CERD/C/259/Add.1), were considered by the Committee at its 1119th meeting, held on 14 August 1995 (see CERD/C/SR.1119).
638. The representative of the State party supplemented the report orally to a substantial extent.
The representative explained that for several decades his country had experienced a series of crises characterized by political instability, the stifling of freedom and an infernal spiral of violence that had led to the total disruption of the State apparatus.
639. The representative pointed out that the Sovereign National Conference had drawn up a National Transitional Charter whose basic principles were the defence of human rights and public freedoms, the establishment of true democracy based on the separation of powers, multi-party politics and free trade unions and print media.
In that context of growing awareness of individual rights and fundamental freedoms and of each person's duties towards society, the National Commission on Human Rights had been established in September 1994.
It was also to be noted that non-governmental human rights organizations had been legally recognized and a large number of international and regional human rights instruments had been ratified.
Such instruments took precedence over domestic laws in the domestic legal order.
640. The population of Chad consisted of some 200 ethnic groups that fell into 12 major groups.
641. The representative, commenting on the implementation of articles 2 and 5 of the Convention, said that all Chadian citizens, without distinction as to race, origin or religion, enjoyed the right to bring legal proceedings, the right to security of person, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to leave the country and to return to it freely, the right to nationality, the right to marriage, the right to own property, the right to freedom of conscience and religion and to freedom of association, the right to work, the right to form and join a trade union, the right to take part in the country's cultural life, and the right of access to any place or service intended for use by the general public.
642. Concerning article 6 of the Convention, the representative said that there was no special judicial or administrative procedure ensuring protection against acts of racial discrimination but that anyone who had been a victim of such acts could always bring criminal indemnification proceedings.
643. The members of the Committee welcomed the presence of the Chadian delegation, despite the country's domestic difficulties and the absence of permanent representation in Geneva, and expressed their appreciation of its oral presentation which had very extensively supplemented the periodic report, thereby constituting practically an additional periodic report.
The members of the Committee regretted, however, that the report had not been drawn up in accordance with the Committee's consolidated guidelines on reporting.
644. Commenting on the general context in which the implementation of the Convention had to be considered, the members of the Committee expressed utmost concern at information about serious human rights violations occurring in the State party.
Such varied sources as the most recent reports to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (E/CN.4/1995/61 and E/CN.4/1995/111), the report by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (E/CN.4/1995/36), the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights on persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities (E/CN.4/1995/84), the 1995 report of the Committee of Experts on the application of ILO Conventions, the observations by the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and various reports by Amnesty International, the International League for the Rights of Man and the Chadian League for Human Rights, attested to summary executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, extrajudicial detention, torture, and the harassment and intimidation of members of non-governmental organizations working for human rights.
645. The members of the Committee stressed the largely ethnic character of the violence characterizing the domestic situation of the State party.
Most of the armed conflict rife in Chad was linked to ethnic issues.
Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in an urgent appeal to the Chadian Government on 26 August 1994, had expressed particular concern over information concerning the execution of members of ethnic minorities.
Numerous abuses against civilians, committed by members of the Republican Guard belonging to the same ethnic group as the President of the Republic, were also reported.
The members of the Committee once again deplored the continuing impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of such acts and the inoperativeness of the judicial system.
646. According to the sources of information mentioned in paragraph 644 above, ethnic minorities close to power, representing roughly 1 per cent of the population, exercised a predominant influence over appointments and the decision-making process in the army and the administration.
Furthermore, the widening gap between the north and the south of the country was reflected even in the capital where entire districts were said to have been formed composed of people from the north or from the south.
The members of the Committee reiterated their request for precise socio-economic data in respect of each major ethnic group.
647. Following those remarks, the members of the Committee expressed a desire to have precise information regarding the following points: regarding the general section of the report, what texts had finally been adopted after the beginning of the process of national reconciliation? What was the position regarding the reform of the Constitution, the proposed adoption of an electoral code, the Amnesty Act and the Human Rights Violations Compensation Act? What reforms had been adopted and implemented to reorganize the security forces and the national police force and to strengthen the judicial system and protect its independence? At what date could it be expected that presidential elections would actually be held?
648. In that worrying national context, the members of the Committee nevertheless noted a few encouraging points, such as the recognition of non-governmental human rights organizations, some improvement in the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression and the emergence of a free press.
649. Concerning article 4 of the Convention, members of the Committee recalled their request for information as to the existence of legislative provisions recognizing as an offence and punishing acts of racial discrimination within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention.
650. Information was requested about the measures taken by the Government to guarantee the effective exercise of remedies through the courts, which should be available to the victims of acts of discrimination, enabling them to obtain punishment and effective reparation for such acts, in accordance with article 6 of the Convention.
Members of the Committee reiterated in that connection their concern regarding reports from non-governmental organizations of government and army interference in the operation of justice, even entailing threats against magistrates, lack of training and a persistent shortage of resources from which all the judiciary personnel were suffering and which was paralysing the institution.
651. The members of the Committee reiterated their request for information as to the measures taken, in accordance with article 7 of the Convention, to help the various ethnic communities culturally, educationally and socially and to promote education to combat racial discrimination.
In that connection the members of the Committee expressed their concern about reports they had received that members of the "National Civic Campaign", a movement launched by several human rights organizations in order to educate the population, particularly with a view to the next elections, had been the victims of harassment and intimidation.
652. The members of the Committee again suggested that the State party, in that difficult context, appeal to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights for technical assistance.
It was also suggested that the oral presentation of the representative of the State party be published in the form of an addition to the periodic report.
653. At its 1125th meeting, held on 17 August 1995, the Committee adopted the following concluding observations.
654. The Committee observed with satisfaction the desire of the Government of the State party and its delegation to renew its dialogue with the Committee, despite the grave domestic problems confronting Chad.
It regretted the fact that the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth reports had not been submitted within the specified times and that the ninth periodic report was extremely brief and did not comply with the Committee's guidelines for the preparation of reports or the provisions of the Convention.
It was, however, pleased that the oral presentation by the delegation of the State party - markedly better than the written report - very extensively supplemented the periodic report.
655. It was noted that the State party had not made the declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention, and members of the Committee requested that consideration should be given to the possibility of making such a declaration.
656. The extensive additional information provided in the delegation's oral presentation, both on institutional matters and on the breakdown of the population and the country's leading socio-economic indicators, was particularly appreciated.
As a result, the delegation was requested to circulate the text of its oral presentation as a supplementary report.
657. The Committee noted Chad's admission to its territory of several non-governmental human rights organizations, and an improvement in the exercise of freedom of expression, in the press and elsewhere.
It also considered highly encouraging the recent ratification of a number of international human rights conventions.
658. Concern was expressed about the allegations of serious human rights violations in the State party, including violations of the Convention.
Concern was also expressed at the paralysis of the judiciary, associated with the lack of resources allocated to the courts, the inadequate training given to judges and political interference.
660. The information given on the socio-economic situation of the population was considered inadequate in the ninth periodic report but much fuller in the delegation's oral presentation.
661. The written report also failed to provide enough information on the existence of legislation giving effect to article 4 of the Convention.
662. As regards the implementation of article 6 of the Convention, the report had not enlightened the Committee as to the steps taken to ensure the effective use of remedies so that victims of racial or ethnic discrimination could secure the punishment of discriminatory acts and compensation for the injury caused.
663. The Committee recommends the State party to provide in its next report, due on 16 September 1996, fuller information on the practical implementation of the Convention and to supply written replies to the questions raised orally during the consideration of the report of Chad, including information on the ethnic characteristics of the population, in accordance with paragraph 8 of the guidelines for the preparation of reports.
664. More precise information was requested on the reforms undertaken following the National Conference intended to begin the process of national reconciliation: the constitutional reform, the draft electoral code, the amnesty act, the law on compensation for victims of human rights violations, the reorganization of the security forces and national gendarmerie, and the strengthening of the judicial apparatus.
665. The next report should also inform the Committee of the actual lines of action open to the National Commission on Human Rights and its activities in terms of the implementation of the Convention.
666. The Committee strongly recommends the State party to make every effort to ensure that the system of justice functions properly, since that is a necessary condition for a return to the rule of law. Help in arranging a solid training programme for judges should be sought from the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.
667. The Committee considers it to be of the utmost importance to set up a training programme in humanitarian law and human rights for members of the armed forces, the police, the national gendarmerie and other State employees.
Assistance could be sought from the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
668. The Committee recommends the State party to ratify the amendments to article 8, paragraph 6, of the Convention adopted by the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties.
B. Statement concerning Israel adopted by the Committee at its forty-sixth session
669. In a note verbale presented by the Permanent Representative of Israel to the Secretary-General of the United Nations dated 6 October 1994, surprise is expressed concerning the Committee's regret that Israel "has not submitted the urgent report the Committee requested in its decision 1 (44) of 7 March 1994".
In this connection Israel drew attention to the materials it submitted on 30 June 1994 and to supplementary information supplied on 8 August 1994, and requested that these materials be published as Israel's report to the Committee.
670. In reply, the Committee sent a letter to the Government of Israel containing the following elements.
(a) The paragraph quoted by Israel from the Committee's concluding observations reads in full: "while the Committee acknowledges the information it has received from Israel through the Secretary-General, the Committee regrets that Israel has not submitted the urgent report the Committee requested in its decision 1 (44) of 7 March 1994"; 8/
(b) On 31 March 1994 the Permanent Mission of Israel informed the Secretary-General that it had established an inquiry committee with respect to the massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron and that a copy of the report of the inquiry committee would be made available to the Committee as a matter of courtesy and without prejudice to the competence of the Committee in the matter;
(c) On the basis of this qualification by Israel itself of the materials supplied, the Committee had good reason to assume that these materials did not constitute the urgent report the Committee had requested.
The Committee's assumption was confirmed by the fact that Israel preferred to be absent when the question was discussed by the Committee;
(d) Now that Israel has indicated that it wishes to see that the materials supplied to the Committee be treated as the urgent report requested by the Committee, the Committee is ready to consider these materials on the same footing as urgent reports requested from other States parties;
(e) Recalling the final paragraph of the concluding observations adopted by the Committee on 18 August 1994, 9/ the Government of Israel is again requested to expedite its seventh and eighth periodic reports, due on 2 February 1992 and 1994 respectively, and to include in them a further response to the observations in question.
They should be submitted in time for consideration at the Committee's forty-seventh session.
THE CONVENTION 671. Under article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, individuals or groups of individuals who claim that any of their rights enumerated in the Convention have been violated by a State party and who have exhausted all available domestic remedies may submit written communications to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for consideration.
A list of the States parties which have made the declaration to permit the consideration of such communications can be found in annex I.B to the present report.
672. Consideration of communications under article 14 of the Convention takes place in closed meetings (rule 88 of the Committee's rules of procedure).
All documents pertaining to the work of the Committee under article 14 (submissions from the parties and other working documents of the Committee) are confidential.
673. The Committee began its work under article 14 of the Convention at its thirtieth session, in 1984.
674. Under article 14, paragraph 8, of the Convention, the Committee shall include in its annual report a summary of the communications considered by it and of the explanations and statements of the States parties concerned, together with the Committee's own suggestions and recommendations thereon.
This reporting stage has not yet been reached in respect of communications Nos. 6/1995 and 7/1995, which were placed before the Committee at its forty-seventh session, in August 1995, and which were sent to the State party concerned under rule 92 of the Committee's rules of procedure.
675. On 15 March 1995, the Committee declared inadmissible communication No. 5/1994 (C. P. v. Denmark).
The communication concerned an American citizen of African origin living in Denmark since 1963, who complained that he and his son had been the victims of racial discrimination by the police and municipal authorities of Roskilde and by the domestic judicial authorities.
In September 1990, C. P. had been elected shop steward at the Technical School of Roskilde; in October 1990, students allegedly began to display signs of racial hostility towards him, but the authorities did not intervene.
Three months later, he was told to leave his work area immediately for another post, and in May 1991, after what he referred to as "months of harassment", he was dismissed by the school.
676. As to events concerning his son, C. P. submitted that four adolescents had insulted and severely beaten his then 15-year-old son.
The local police allegedly were reluctant to investigate the incident thoroughly.
The author contends that the court proceedings against his son's aggressors were biased, and that the defendants were allowed to "distort" evidence in court.
677. In respect of proceedings related to the author's dismissal, the Committee noted that C. P.'s lawyer had been privately retained.
Thus, the lawyer's inaction or negligence to appeal the judgement at first instance in the case to a higher court within statutory deadlines could not be attributed to the State party.
Since the author had failed to provide prima facie evidence that the judicial proceedings had been tainted by racially discriminatory considerations, and since it was C. P.'s own responsibility to pursue all available domestic remedies, the Committee concluded that the requirements of article 14, paragraph 7 (a), of the Convention had not been met.
It further observed that the fact that one of the accused was the son of a court clerk had been duly taken into consideration in that the authorities had nominated a substitute judge from another venue to sit on the case.
679. On the basis of these findings, the Committee concluded that there was no evidence that either the police investigation or the judicial proceedings before the court of Roskilde or the Eastern Division of the High Court of Denmark were tainted by racially discriminatory considerations.
This part of the communication thus was equally deemed inadmissible.
680. For the text of the Committee's decision on communication No. 5/1994, see annex VIII.
V. CONSIDERATION OF COPIES OF PETITIONS, COPIES OF REPORTS
AND OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO TRUST AND NON-SELF-
CONFORMITY WITH ARTICLE 15 OF THE CONVENTION 681. Under article 15 of the Convention, the Committee is empowered to consider copies of petitions, copies of reports and other information relating to Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories and to all other territories to which General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) applies, transmitted to it by the competent bodies of the United Nations, and to submit to them and to the General Assembly its expressions of opinion and recommendations relating to the principles and objectives of the Convention in those Territories.
682. At its 1994 session, the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples continued to follow the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
The Special Committee also continued to monitor related developments in the Territories, having regard to the relevant provisions of article 15 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 14/
683. As a result of earlier decisions of the Trusteeship Council and the Special Committee, the Secretary-General transmitted to the Committee at its forty-sixth and forty-seventh sessions the documents listed in annex V to the present report.
684. At its 1126th meeting, on 17 August 1995, the Committee decided to take note of the relevant documentation and information submitted to it under article 15 of the Convention and to make the following observations:
"The Committee once again finds it impossible to fulfil its functions under article 15, paragraph 2 (a), of the Convention, due to the total absence of any copies of petitions as provided therein.
685. The Committee considered this item at its forty-sixth session.
For its consideration of the item, the Committee had before it the following documents:
(a) General Assembly resolution 49/145, Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination;
(b) General Assembly resolution 49/178, Effective implementation of international instruments on human rights, including reporting obligations under international instruments on human rights;
(c) Note by the Secretary-General transmitting to the General Assembly the report of the fifth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies (A/49/537);
(d) Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights concerning the implementation of human rights instruments; 15/
(e) Relevant summary records of the Third Committee (A/C.3/49/SR.3-8, 17, 22, 33-36, 43, 47, 50, 60, 65, 66);
(f) Reports of the Third Committee (A/49/604 and A/49/604/Add.1).
A. Annual report submitted by the Committee on the Elimination
of Racial Discrimination under article 9, paragraph 2, of
the Convention 686. Members of the Committee noted the renewed support by the General Assembly for the Committee's early-warning and prevention procedures and appreciation was expressed for the commendation for this procedure contained in General Assembly resolution 49/145.
Note was also taken of the general support of member States for the work of the Committee and for their acknowledgement of its important role in combating racial discrimination.
Committee members welcomed the encouragement directed by the General Assembly to States which had not yet done so to ratify the Convention and the amendments concerning funding of the Committee.
B. Effective implementation of international instruments on human rights, including reporting obligations
under international instruments on human rights
687. Members of the Committee took note of and welcomed General Assembly resolution 49/178, by which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to finance, as of 1995, annual meetings of the persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies.
Members also welcomed the appreciation expressed for initiatives taken by treaty bodies to elaborate early-warning measures and urgent procedures, and note was taken of the recommendation that the treaty bodies bring situations of massive violations of human rights to the attention of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the Secretary-General.
ARTICLE 9 OF THE CONVENTION A. Reports received by the Committee
688. At its thirty-eighth session, in 1988, the Committee decided to accept the proposal of the States parties that States parties submit a comprehensive report every four years and a brief updating report in the two-year interim.

of reports by States parties
690. At its forty-sixth and forty-seventh sessions, the Committee reviewed the question of delays and non-submission of reports by States parties in accordance with their obligations under article 9 of the Convention.
691. At its forty-second session, the Committee, having emphasized that the delays in reporting by States parties hampered it in monitoring implementation of the Convention, decided that it would continue to proceed with the review of the implementation of the provisions of the Convention by the States parties whose reports were excessively overdue.
In accordance with a decision taken at its thirty-ninth session, the Committee agreed that this review would be based upon the last reports submitted by the State party concerned and their consideration by the Committee.
In implementation of those decisions in 1994 and 1995 letters were addressed by the Chairman of the Committee to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the following States parties - Cambodia, Panama, India, Venezuela, Madagascar and Pakistan - informing them of the decision taken by the Committee and inviting the Governments concerned to designate a representative to participate in the consideration of their respective reports.
Of those States parties, four (Cambodia, Panama, India and Madagascar) requested postponement of the review with a view to submitting the requested reports, and one, Venezuela, submitted a report.
692. At its forty-sixth session the Committee decided to undertake a second round of reviews of the implementation of the Convention in States parties whose reports remained seriously overdue.
The first of these reviews, concerning Sierra Leone, was undertaken at the forty-seventh session.
693. The Committee further decided, at its 1127th meeting, held on 18 August 1995, to request the Secretary-General, in accordance with rule 66, paragraph 1, of the rules of procedure of the Committee, to continue sending appropriate reminders to States parties from which two or more reports were due but had not been received before the closing date of its forty-seventh session, asking them to submit their reports by 31 December 1995.
694. The Committee considered this item at its forty-sixth session (1095th meeting) and at its forty-seventh session (1100th and 1112th meetings).
695. For the consideration of this item, the Committee had before it the following documents:
(a) General Assembly resolution 49/146 on the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination;
(b) Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/20 on measures to combat contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; resolution 1995/11 on the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, and resolution 1995/12 on measures to combat contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;
(c) Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities resolution 1993/3 on measures to combat racism and racial discrimination and the role of the Subcommission, resolution 1994/2 on a world conference against racism, racial and ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and other related contemporary forms of intolerance, and resolution 1994/4 on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities;
(d) Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (E/1995/111 and Add.1);
(e) Report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance (E/CN.4/1995/78 and Add.1).
696. At its 1095th meeting, on 22 March 1995, the Committee met with the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Mr. Gl√©l√©-Ahanhanzo.
The Special Rapporteur described his mandate, indicated that he welcomed all possibilities for close cooperation with the Committee and requested the Committee's views on his working methods and programme of activities.
697. Members offered on the one hand to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur and drew attention to points of complementarity and of difference in the respective mandates.
It was, for instance, noted that the Committee could only address situations within States which were parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, whereas the Special Rapporteur was not so constrained. Members recommended that the Special Rapporteur give priority attention to issues falling within his mandate in countries that have not yet ratified the Convention.
It was, however, observed that the Committee was well placed to identify actual or impending situations of racial discrimination in 143 countries of the world and that there was room for the development of cooperation with regard to the taking of appropriate preventative action.
There was general agreement that an important area of cooperation might be the regular exchange of information, and Committee members observed that they already paid close attention to the reports of the Special Rapporteur in the context of their examination of reports submitted by States parties.
It was suggested that the Special Rapporteur, in his work, should take account of the reports of the Committee and the general recommendations which it had issued concerning the terms of the Convention.
698. In reply, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the various suggestions made and proposed that he and the Committee undertake a range of shared projects of study and research.
He also drew attention to the need for the United Nations Secretariat to facilitate a regular exchange of information between him and the Committee.
699. The 1112th meeting of the Committee, held on 8 August 1995, was a joint meeting with the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, held in the presence of the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. I. Fall.
This meeting had been proposed by the Subcommission in its resolution 1993/3, entitled "Measures to combat racism and racial discrimination and the role of the Subcommission", and had as its purpose the elaboration of recommendations concerning comprehensive measures to be taken at national and international levels to combat contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
As well as the Committee and the Subcommission, the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Gl√©l√©-Ahanhanzo, also participated.
700. Speakers made a wide range of suggestions and recommendations regarding immediate joint action, methods of ongoing cooperation, possibilities for the undertaking of joint studies, preparations for the proposed world conference against racism, and the development of preventive procedures.
It was proposed by a number of speakers that a joint statement be issued during the current respective sessions of the Committee and Subcommission concerning situations of massive violations of human rights which had as a major component racial, ethnic or related discrimination, in particular the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda.
It was noted that a statement should draw attention to the need to bring the perpetrators of such acts to justice and to the importance of strengthening and supporting the international ad hoc criminal tribunals.
It was also felt that the statement should draw attention to the plight of persons displaced as a result of racial or ethnically motivated hatred and violence.
701. Speakers suggested that joint studies be undertaken concerning, inter alia, the meaning and effect of articles 4 and 7 of the Convention, the development of preventive procedures, the rise of racist speech in the media, especially the electronic media, minorities, and the existing inadequacies of international law on migration issues.
It was also proposed that both bodies might issue a joint recommendation on human rights education.
702. At the conclusion of the joint meeting, the two Chairmen issued an agreed declaration for joint and cooperative action whereby (i) the bureaux of the two bodies would meet on an annual basis and the two bodies might hold joint meetings again in the future; (ii) a speedy and efficient flow of information would be immediately put in place; (iii) a joint study would be undertaken concerning article 7 of the Convention; and (iv) the two bodies would, at their current sessions, issue a joint statement concerning massive and gross occurrences of racial and related discrimination.

General recommendation XIX (47) on article 3, adopted at
1. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination calls the attention of States parties to the wording of article 3, by which States parties undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of racial segregation and apartheid in territories under their jurisdiction.
The reference to apartheid may have been directed exclusively to South Africa, but the article as adopted prohibits all forms of racial segregation in all countries.
2. The Committee believes that the obligation to eradicate all practices of this nature includes the obligation to eradicate the consequences of such practices undertaken or tolerated by previous Governments in the State or imposed by forces outside the State.
3. The Committee observes that while conditions of complete or partial racial segregation may in some countries have been created by governmental policies, a condition of partial segregation may also arise as an unintended by-product of the actions of private persons.
In many cities residential patterns are influenced by group differences in income, which are sometimes combined with differences of race, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin, so that inhabitants can be stigmatized and individuals suffer a form of discrimination in which racial grounds are mixed with other grounds.
4. The Committee therefore affirms that a condition of racial segregation can also arise without any initiative or direct involvement by the public authorities.
It invites States parties to monitor all trends which can give rise to racial segregation, to work for the eradication of any negative consequences that ensue, and to describe any such action in their periodic reports.
ANNEX VIII Decision of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination under article 14 of the International
Forty-sixth session
concerning Communication No. 5/1994*
Submitted by: C. P.
Alleged victims: The author and his son, M. P.
State party concerned: Denmark
Date of communication: 13 January 1994 (initial submission)
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, established under article 8 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,
Meeting on 15 March 1995,
Adopts the following:
Decision on admissibility
1. The author of the communication is C. P., an American citizen of African origin living in Roskilde, Denmark.
He submits the communication on his behalf and on behalf of his son, and contends that they have been the victims of racial discrimination by the municipal and police authorities of Roskilde and the Danish judicial system.
He does not invoke specific provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
The facts as submitted by the author
2.1 The author is an African American, who has been residing in Denmark since 1963; he married a Danish citizen in 1963, who later left him and from whom he is now divorced.
From 1964 to 1972, he worked for a chemicals company in Roskilde; from 1972 to an unspecified date, he worked for Kodak Inc., as shop steward in a warehouse.
In September 1990, he was elected shop steward at the Roskilde Technical School.
He contends that starting in October 1990, students of the school began to display signs of racism towards him; the school authorities allegedly did not intervene.
Mr. P. claims that a number of * Made public by decision of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. students, with the blessing of their teacher, carved a racially offensive inscription and cartoon into a red brick.
The inscription ran approximately as follows: "A coal black man hanging from a gallows, with large red lips".
Under this was inscribed the word "nigger".
This brick and other, similar ones, allegedly were openly displayed in the author's working area.
Again, the school authorities failed to intervene and allowed the display to continue.
2.2 On 19 November 1990, the author participated in a meeting of the School Staff Council; at the meeting, he showed two of the bricks and asked the school's support in fighting or suppressing this form of racism.
To his surprise, the director of the school criticized him for raising the issue; no measures were taken to identify the students responsible for the "display".
The author adds that after the meeting, the school director, head teacher and technical manager refused to talk to him.
2.3 In January 1991, the author was informed that he was to leave immediately, with 10 minutes' notice only, the area where he had been working since being hired by the school.
He attributes this to the hostile and discriminatory attitude of the school superintendent and others towards him.
Still in January 1991, the author was asked to carry out certain tasks in the school cafeteria, during student breaks.
Here, he allegedly was again confronted with the racist remarks and slogans of the students directed towards him; when he asked the school director to be removed from the area, the latter refused.
In May 1991, after what the author refers to as "months of racial harassment", the school director and technical manager dismissed him.
2.4 As to the events concerning his son, the author submits the following: on 20 July 1991, the author's son M., then 15 years old, was stopped on his bicycle at a traffic light by a group of four young men aged 17 and 18, who severely beat him, using, inter alia, beer bottles.
M. sustained a number of injuries (nose, front, cheeks and jaw), which have since necessitated numerous plastic surgery interventions; the last such intervention was in 1994.
According to the author, all four men had previously made racist slurs and remarks to his son and that, in 1988, they had tried to drown him in a lake in a public park.
This previous incident had been reported to the police which did not, according to the author, investigate it but dismissed it as a "boyish joke".
2.5 The author immediately reported the incident of 20 July 1991 to the police.
He complains that the police requested to see his residence permit and a copy of his rental agreement instead of swiftly investigating the matter; according to him, the police was reluctant to investigate the incident expeditiously and thoroughly, which allegedly had to do with his colour.
Two of his son's assailants were briefly kept in police custody for interrogation; another was remanded in custody for another week.
2.6 The author claims that the court proceedings against his son's aggressors were biased, and that the defendants were allowed to "distort" the evidence in the case.
Eventually, one received a suspended prison sentence of 60 days, whereas two others were sentenced to pay ten daily fines of 50 and 100 Danish kroner (DKr), respectively.
According to the author, the outcome of the case was at odds with the medical evidence presented and the doctor's testimony in court.
Mr. P complains about an alleged "judicial cover-up" of the case, noting that the mother of one of the defendants works for the Roskilde District Court.
The author's attempts to have the case removed from the docket of the Roskilde District Court and moved to another venue in Copenhagen were unsuccessful.
In his initial submission, the author does not state whether he appealed the sentence against his son's aggressors pronounced by the District Court.
2.7 Concerning his dismissal from the Roskilde Technical School, the author notes that he filed a complaint for "racial harassment and unlawful dismissal".
This complaint was heard on 8 and 9 April 1992, 11 months after the dismissal; it appears that, initially, the case was to be heard in January 1992.
The author asserts that the school director and the technical manager "conspired" to distort and blur all the evidence.
The judge dismissed the author's complaint, in a reasoned judgement of 29 pages, adding that Mr. P was not entitled to monetary compensation but to have his court and legal fees waived.
According to the author, the judge refused to grant leave to a higher tribunal.
On 10 June 1992, therefore, the author wrote to the Attorney-General, who advised him to submit the case to the Civil Rights Department.
By letter dated 3 February 1993, the Department replied that the deadline for filing an appeal had expired.
The author suspects that, since he had told his legal representative that he wanted to appeal, all the parties involved are "conspiring that he [should] not bring a racism case against ... the Danish Government".
2.8 Finally, the author refers to a malpractice suit which he filed against his lawyer.
It transpires from his submissions that a panel of lawyers and judges, which included a judge of the Danish Supreme Court, has also dismissed this complaint.
The complaint
3.1 The author complains that he and his son have been victims of racial discrimination on the part of the Roskilde police and judicial authorities, and concludes that the judicial system and legal profession have shown much solidarity in covering up and dismissing his own and his son's case.
He contends that there is no domestic law which would protect non-citizens and non-whites from racial harassment and unlawful dismissal in Denmark.
3.2 The author seeks: (a) a ruling under whose terms he is given a new hearing in his suit for unlawful dismissal against the Roskilde Technical School; (b) the Committee's recommendation that the aggressors of his son be re-indicted and prosecuted/tried once again for the offence of 20 July 1991; and (c) a condemnation of the attitude of the police and judicial authorities involved in the case.
The State party's information and observations and the author's comments thereon
4.1 In its submission under rule 92 of the Committee's rules of procedure, the State party divides the complaint into the suit for unlawful dismissal filed by Mr. P. and the criminal proceedings against the presumed aggressors of his son.
4.2 As to the first issue, the State party observes that, in April 1992, the Roskilde Court heard the complaint filed by the author on 19 November 1991 with a request that he be awarded 100,000 DKr for unlawful dismissal, and that it delivered its judgement on 5 May 1992.
It notes that the author's claim, based on section 26 of the Liability for Damages Act, was founded partly on the argument that the Technical School had not taken any measures in connection with the appearance of the bricks with typically racist motives, partly on the claim that the school had remained passive vis-√†-vis the author's request to discuss the matter in the Cooperation Committee, partly on the claim that the school had reacted to the author's grievances by transferring him to a post including work as a canteen watchman, and that the school had later dismissed him without any valid reason.
4.3 The State party notes that the Court, in its judgement, found that the author had not submitted the matter involving the display of the bricks to the school authorities until several weeks after Mr. P. had first seen the bricks.
This delay, the Court held, contributed significantly to impeding the investigations into who was responsible for the display.
On that ground, it concluded that the mere fact that investigations were slack was not in itself sufficient to hold the school liable for damages.
4.4 The Court, in its judgement, characterized as "very unfortunate" the failure of the school to take up Mr. P.'s complaints for detailed discussion of the incident in the Cooperation Committee when asked to do so, but found that this alone did not give rise to liability for damages.
The Court further held that, at the time of Mr. P.'s transfer to another post, his dismissal would have been justified for financial reasons.
The Court argued that the school could not be blamed for having tried to keep Mr. P. at work through transfer to another job which, in the judges' opinion, was not "obviously degrading", as claimed by the author.
4.5 The Court further observed that the fact that it did not become known until the examination of witnesses during the court hearing that the principal of the school had indeed had one of the bricks in his possession and had shown them to some of his assistants could not - however unfortunate this might appear - be deemed an unlawful act giving rise to the liability of the school.
4.6 With regard to the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies by Mr. P., the State party gives the following information:
Pursuant to section 368 of the Administration of Justice Act, the author could appeal the judgement of the Roskilde Court to the Eastern Division of the Danish High Court.
Under section 372(1), the time allowed for appeal is four weeks from the day the judgement is given.
Sections 372(2) and 399(2) regulate some exceptions to this rule and allow for appeals even after the expiration of this period.
4.7 By letter of 25 May 1992 addressed to the Ministry of Justice, the author outlined the circumstances which led to the proceedings before the Roskilde Court and its judgement in the case.
No information was given in this letter as to when judgement had been given, nor were details given about the nature of the legal action.
On 9 June 1992, the Ministry of Justice informed the author that it could not intervene in, or change, decisions handed down by courts of law.
In this letter, the Ministry advised the author that he could appeal the judgement to the Eastern Division of the High Court and informed him about the statutory deadlines for the filing of such an appeal.
4.8 On 10 June 1992, the author petitioned the Department of Private Law in the Ministry of Justice for permission to appeal after the expiration of the period allowed for appeal (section 372(2) of the Administration of Justice Act).
As the lawyer did not hear from Mr. P., he wrote to him again on 19 May, requesting him to contact him telephonically.
The lawyer then explained the operation of section 372 of the Administration of Justice Act to him.
4.9 After completing its review of the case, the Department of Private Law refused, by letter dated 3 February 1993, to grant permission to appeal the judgement of the Court of Roskilde to the Eastern Division of the Danish High Court.
Against this background, the State party contends that the author's complaint must be declared inadmissible on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.
It is due to the author's own actions and/or negligence that the judgement of 5 May 1992 was not appealed in time.
4.10 In this context, the State party notes that Mr. P. contacted the Department of Private Law once again on the same matter on 7 January 1994.
His letter was interpreted by the Department as a request for reconsideration of the issue.
By letter of 16 March 1994, the Department maintained its decision of 3 February 1993.
By letter of 7 June 1994 addressed to the Department of Private Law rather than to the Supreme Court of Denmark, the author applied for legal aid for the purpose of filing an application with the Supreme Court, so as to obtain permission for an extraordinary appeal under section 399 of the Administration of Justice Act.
On 9 August 1994, the Department informed him that an application to this effect had to be examined at first instance by the County of Roskilde, where his application had thus been forwarded to.
4.11 With regard to the events of 20 July 1991 involving the author's son, the State party refers to the transcript of the hearing before the Court of Roskilde, which shows that the incident opposing M. P. to three young residents of Roskilde was thoroughly examined, and evidence properly evaluated, by the Court.
Additionally, there were two lay judges, as the case involved an offence punishable by the loss of liberty (section 686(2) of the Administration of Justice Act).
4.12 On 27 January 1992, the Court of Roskilde handed down its judgement in the case.
The Chief Constable of Roskilde found the punishment imposed on M. M. H. (60 days' suspended prison sentence) too lenient.
The Court concluded that given the violent nature of Mr. H.'s attack on M. P., an unconditional prison sentence of 40 days should be imposed.
4.13 As regards Mr. P.'s allegations submitted to the Committee on behalf of his son, the State party argues that they are inadmissible, partly because they fall outside the scope of the Convention, partly because they are manifestly ill-founded.
It notes that the communication does not give any details about the nature of the violations of the Convention in relation to the way in which the authorities and tribunals handled the criminal case against the three persons accused of violence against M. P.
4.14 The State party denies that, because of the race and colour of M. P., the courts gave the three offenders a lighter sentence than others would have received for similar use of violence.
It points out that no importance whatsoever was attached, in the proceedings either before the Roskilde Court or those before the Eastern Division of the High Court, to this element.
It is submitted that on the contrary, both the courts and the police of Roskilde took the case against the three individuals accused of aggressing M. P. very seriously: this appears both from the sentence imposed on Mr. H. and from the fact that he was remanded in custody after the incident, upon order of the Court of Roskilde of 21 July 1991.
4.15 The State party further recalls that the prosecution authorities felt that the sentence of the Court of Roskilde was too lenient with regard to one of the aggressors, which is why this sentence was appealed to the Eastern Division of the High Court, which increased the sentence from 60 days' imprisonment (suspended) to 40 days' unconditional imprisonment.
In this connection, it is noted that an unconditional sentence is exactly what the prosecution had called for initially.
4.16 Finally, as regards the question of damages to M. P., the State party notes that in the judgement of 27 January 1992 of the Roskilde Court, he was awarded DKr 3,270, which Mr. H. was required to pay.
According to the decision of the Eastern Division of the High Court, of 3 June 1992, Mr. H. had paid this amount by that time.
Damages awarded by this sentence covered only pain and suffering, while M. P.'s request that the offenders' liability to pay damages to him should be included in the sentence was referred to the civil courts.
Pursuant to section 993 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, claims for damages may be brought before the (civil) courts for decision.
The State party ignores whether the author's son has in fact instituted (civil) proceedings in this matter.
5.1 In his comments, dated 25 January 1995, the author takes issue with most of the State party's arguments and reiterates that he was denied his civil rights, as were his son's.
He again refers to the trial against the three individuals who had aggressed his son as "a farce", and complains that the lawyer assigned to represent his son never told the latter what to expect, or how to prepare himself for the hearing.
Mr. P. complains that the judge was biased in allowing the accused to present their version of the incident one after the other without interference from the Court.
He dismisses several passages in the judgement as "directly misleading" and complains that a professional judge was allowed to ask his son "subjective questions" and use his answers against him.
He further asserts that by concluding that, on the basis of the testimonies heard by the court, it was impossible to say who exactly started the fight, the Court "protect[ed] racist attitudes of the whites" and used a "camouflage excuse to find the accused innocent".
5.2 The author further refers to what he perceives as a miscarriage of justice: what exactly the miscarriage consists of remains difficult to establish, but it would appear that the author objects in particular to the way the judge interrogated his son and allowed the testimony of the accused to stand.
The author strongly objects to the decision of the prosecution not to appeal the sentences against two of the accused.
The author sums up the Court's attitude as follows: "I ask how can a judge determine a fair decision without hearing all the evidence or even worse just listening to the criminals explaining unless he wanted to pass a lenient sentence.
Which he did.
Very unprofessional."
5.3 As to the proceedings concerning the allegedly racist and unlawful dismissal from employment at the Roskilde Technical School, the author reiterates his version of the events and submits that he has "exhausted every possible known means to be heard and appeal [his] case".
He contends that the school was not justified in dismissing him out of financial considerations, as it had recently expanded its facilities and could have used the services of a shop steward.
He alleges that before the Court, the director of the Technical School committed perjury.
5.4 The author emphatically asserts that the delays in appealing the decision of the Roskilde Court should not be attributed to him.
He notes that he had trusted his lawyer to handle the issue of the appeal; contrary to the assertion of the State party and his former representative, he contends that he did contact his lawyer to confirm that he wanted to appeal "at all cost", even though his lawyer had advised him that the chances of succeeding on appeal were slim.
He blames his lawyer for having acted evasively at around the time - that is, during the first days of June 1992 - when the deadline for appealing the decision of the Court of Roskilde was approaching.
Furthermore, the author once again, even if indirectly, accuses his representative of malpractice and suspects that the lawyer struck a deal with the judge not to have the venue of the case transferred to the Copenhagen High Court.
5.5 In conclusion, the author contends that the State party's submission is replete with "preposterous inconsistencies" and dismisses most of its observations as "misleading", "incorrect", "untrue" or "direct misleading".
It is obvious that he contests the evaluation of evidence made by the Courts in both cases - his action against the Technical School and the criminal case against the aggressors of his son - and is convinced that the cases were dismissed because of racist attitudes of all concerned vis-√†-vis himself and his son.
He complains that there is "no affirmative action against racism in Denmark today".
Issues and proceedings before the Committee
6.1 Before considering any claims contained in a communication, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination must, in accordance with rule 91 of its rules of procedure, determine whether or not it is admissible under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
6.2 The Committee has noted the arguments of the parties in respect of the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies concerning Mr. P.'s claim of unlawful dismissal by the Technical School of Roskilde.
It recalls that the Court of Roskilde heard the complaint on 19 November 1991 and delivered its reasoned judgement on 5 May 1992; said judgement was notified to the author by his lawyer on 6 May 1992.
The author affirms that he did convey to his lawyer in time that he wanted to appeal this judgement, and he blames the lawyer for having acted negligently by failing to file the appeal within statutory deadlines.
The Committee notes that the file before it reveals that the author's lawyer was privately retained.
In the circumstances, this lawyer's inaction or negligence cannot be attributed to the State party.
Although the State party's judicial authorities did provide the author with relevant information on how to file his appeal in a timely manner, it is questionable whether, given the fact that the author alleged to have been the victim of racial harassment, the authorities have really exhausted all means to ensure that the author could enjoy effectively his rights in accordance with article 6 of the Convention.
However, since the author did not provide prima facie evidence that the judicial authorities were tainted by racially discriminatory considerations and since it was the author's own responsibility to pursue the domestic remedies, the Committee concludes that the requirements of article 14, paragraph 7 (a), of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, are not met.
6.3 As to the part of the author's case relating to the criminal proceedings against the aggressors of his son, the Committee notes that the police took these aggressors into custody after the author had reported the incident of 20 July 1991, and that the Chief Constable of the Roskilde police subsequently requested that they be criminally prosecuted.
It also observes that the fact that one of the accused was the son of a Court clerk was duly taken into account, in that the authorities nominated a substitute judge from another venue to sit on the case.
The Committee concludes that no prima facie case of violation of the Convention has been established in respect of this part of the communication, and that, therefore, it is equally inadmissible.
7. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination therefore decides:
(a) That the communication is inadmissible;
(b) That this decision shall be transmitted to the State party and to the author.

[Original: English]
I. National space programme
A. SAC-B light satellite
Space activities demand significant intellectual investment.
Profiting from the data collected by means of space technology resources, the development of space communication systems or the access to and use of the extraterrestrial space for other purposes require process formulation and development and the management of data obtained through scientific methods or within the framework of scientific research projects.
SAC-B is an Argentine-American satellite designed to advance the study of solar physics and astrophysics through the examination of solar flares, gamma ray bursts, diffuse X-ray cosmic background, and energetic neutral atoms. SAC-B, a 181-kg. spacecraft, will be launched into orbit by a Pegasus-XL rocket.
It will carry SAC-B to an altitude of 550 km. and a circular orbit inclined at 38 degrees to the Earth's equator, which will ensure an orbital lifetime of at least three years.
The scientific payload of SAC-B comprises an Argentine instrument, the Hard X-Ray Spectrometer (HXRS), developed by the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physic to measure the temporal evolution of X-ray emissions from solar flares and non-solar gamma bursts; a combination of detectors to measure soft X-rays emitted by solar flares and gamma ray bursts provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Goddard X-Ray Experiment-GXRE); a diffuse X-ray background detector using CCD (charge couple device) technology (CUBIC) from Penn State University; and an Italian instrument to measure energetic neutral atoms (ISENA).
The SAC-B mission will be controlled from a ground station located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
This facility comprises the Telemetry, Tracking and Control (TT&C) Station and the Mission Operations Control Center.
The TT&C station has a 3.6-m. autotracking antenna, and it enables range and Doppler measurements and Master Clock Reception (GPS).
The Control Center consists of two fully redundant Sun workstations linked to the receiving and transmitting equipment as well as to PC-486 terminals, which will control the satellite.
SAC-B is carried out as an international cooperative project between Argentina's National Commission of Space Activities (CONAE) and the United States of America's National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The Secretariat of Science and Technology of Argentina participates in the financing of the project, through the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET).
CONAE is responsible for the design and construction of the SAC-B spacecraft, the HXRS instrument, the ground station operation, and the scientific data distribution.
NASA will provide two scientific instruments, launch services on a Pegasus launch vehicle and support for initial orbit monitoring and emergency backup throughout the mission.
By a separate agreement established with Argentina, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) will provide the solar arrays plus a scientific instrument.
The Brazilian National Institute on Space Research is providing the facilities for the system qualification tests of SAC-B, and a Brazilian co-investigator with the Argentine instrument.
II. Economic benefits of national space activities
The telecommunications systems based on artificial satellites are the best example of this; after going through a stage of experimental development, they were assimilated by the companies providing such services and these companies were the ones taking care of the diffusion and application of this new technological concept.
The present trend in this field is that, in the short and medium term, the promotion of advanced matters in this technology must remain within governmental agencies, while development work related to the optimisation and service expansion is left in the hands of the private sector.
However, CONAE will have to develop technologies associated to other non-massive data transmission services involving economic significance and social relevance (education, safety, isolated human settlements, maintenance of extensive networks such as gas pipelines, high-voltage lines, etc.).
The areas that will show the most direct economic impact in the short and medium term are:
‚óè The follow-up and quantification of agricultural and forestry production.
‚óè The follow-up and surveillance of fishing activities.
‚óè The supervision of floods and natural disasters.
‚óè The evaluation and survey of soil and underground exploitation works.
‚óè The monitoring and supervision of environmental problems.
Additionally, there are other secondary markets connected with remote sensing that, due to the early phase of their use in the country, are hard to estimate:
‚óè The market of geographical data systems and their related databases (Applied Data Systems (ADS)).
‚óè Global climatic reporting and forecasting.
‚óè The market of special sensors.
In addition to constituting a valuable base of general information, the use of remote sensing data in agricultural exploitation may give way to more accurate forecasting of future harvests, to better control of promotion loans and of tax collection, and to better use of subsidies on natural disasters.
As an example, it may be mentioned that, when correlated with climatic factors, a detailed historical database on agricultural production should serve as a basis for a market of agricultural insurance, an activity that is now emerging.
In the area of fishing, the use of satellite data may result in more effective campaigns and in fuel savings due to the satellite positioning of areas of high fishing density.
Appropriate satellite data is also indispensable for the surveillance and control of fishing licences concerning operations in the Argentine Sea and for the supervision of over-exploitation of fishing resources.
Remote sensing in the field of mining would result in significant savings in exploration campaigns.
The development of space technologies to be envisaged within the framework of the National Space Programme will produce the maximum and most immediate social and economic return.
This can be attained by focusing efforts towards its use in:
‚óè Contributing to education and to improving the population's quality of life, particularly in distant and marginal areas.
‚óè Creating new capabilities and sources of employment at industries producing goods with a high added value.
‚óè Obtaining advantages for the local production system, thus allowing for the entry of our industry into a highly competitive international market.
‚óè Promoting new businesses that allow for an expansion of the national production scope.
The most suitable way to attain such goals is the application of a strategy involving the concentration of efforts and specialisation, through the identification of well-defined objectives and of attractive technological and commercial spots, where an international level of excellence and of originality can be reached and maintained.
The space programme must be considered as a part and continuation of the efforts for technological development already being carried out in our country.
From the very start, it must profit from an important threshold of scientific and technological knowledge already gained through the activities performed by the former CNIE (National Commission of Space Research) and by other local scientific and technological institutions, such as INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology), INTI (National Institute of Industrial Technology), CONICET (National Council of Scientific and Technical Research), CNEA (National Atomic Energy Commission), universities and other agencies.
The space programme must be supported by a flexible research and development infrastructure optimising CONAE's infrastructure and by the use of resources assigned to space activities.
For that reason, it must interact with whatever public and private institutions and work teams are deemed necessary, by means of a flexible organisation that may be adapted to correspond with the progress attained. The guidelines established to meet these requirements are:
‚óè Offering society a complete cycle of space data, promoting their best utilisation.
‚óè Developing space technologies for environmental protection.
‚óè Promoting the use of space technology for social, production, scientific and educational purposes.
‚óè Developing light satellites for remote sensing, scientific use and communications, supplementing those available internationally and responding to specific national demands.
‚óè Promoting actions supplementing those in the private sector concerning initiatives with a technological and innovation content, or the use, diffusion and utilisation of space data.
‚óè Encouraging the training and qualification of human resources and of organisations contributing to and participating in the space programme.
‚óè Assisting in promoting national participation and initiatives aimed at enhancing the tasks of international forums where juridical regulations related to space activities are discussed and prepared.
‚óè Promoting international cooperation actions and Argentine participation in multinational cooperation programmes converging with local long-term policies.
‚óè Favouring joint international actions and programmes with shared goals that contribute to regional integration within the framework of MERCOSUR.
‚óè Complying with the legal mandate of contributing the technical and scientific elements needed for shaping coordinated and joint actions with other State agencies.
III. Juridical matters and international relations
International cooperation is a key issue as far as space technology is concerned.
Argentina has already had lengthy and active cooperation with Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and the United States, and is presently planning joint projects with Denmark, Spain and other countries.
CONAE will encourage these lines of cooperation, as far as they converge with the development work scheduled in the national space programme and involve concrete projects aimed at well-defined goals.
Any initiatives or proposals for international cooperation implying diversification of efforts will be considered by CONAE to be of secondary importance.
CONAE will place special emphasis on strengthening regional cooperation in space matters.
It will look forward to expanding the goals and to optimising the tasks scheduled in the present programme, encouraging active cooperation within the framework of MERCOSUR.
It will promote the use of supplementary infrastructural resources and development means in the region, schedule the performance of mutual assistance actions, contemplate supplementary development work and explore the possibilities of performing joint space missions.
With its own actions and as far as it converges with its objectives, CONAE will support the initiative for research on Global Change, which is presently acquiring institutional and international cooperation dimensions, with the IGBP (International Geosphere Biosphere Programme) and other institutions.
This research work will demand a highly significant effort in the space field and is important for the rational management of renewable natural resources and of the region's biodiversity, as well as for forecasting social and economic changes that may affect the country and the hemisphere.
IV. Scheduled space activities
The main areas of space activity foreseen in Argentina involve both scientific and technological research work and applications.
These scientific and technological projects will enable progress to be made in the preparation and management of space missions, as well as in the design of satellites and of on-board instrumentation.
Likewise, this activity will make possible the consolidation of international cooperation links in the space field.
Application activities will be primarily devoted to a remote sensing programme and to telecom-munication matters supplementing those offered locally and internationally in data, voice and television communications.
Activities in remote sensing include both the reception and distribution of images from international systems and our own image generation within the optical range (visible and infrared) and microwaves appropriate for local requirements and of great social relevance.
As part of the land infrastructure, provisions are being made for the installation of a multipurpose ground station aimed at satisfying both remote sensing and radioastronomy demands.
Concerning the production of our own images and data, provisions have been made for the development of satellite systems to be compatible with the scientific and technological research work, through the SAC (Satellite for Scientific Applications) line of light satellites.
The development of satellite systems involves the design of chambers and sensors and of computation instruments required for receiving, storing and processing the data produced, thus integrating the main links of the Space Information Cycle (SIC).
The use of the infrared spectrum is relevant to the oceanographic applications, as well as to environmental monitoring (forest fires and volcanic activity).
With regard to the visible optical range, the medium-term trends in the international arena involve an increase in the number of spectral observation channels, so as to make it more specific to and versatile for various applications which have been contemplated in the third SAC satellite.
Finally, as a long-term development objective, studies are to be performed on laser applications in space.
In the short term, the remote sensing programme will be supplemented with observations in the microwave range by means of radar.
This is an important method, since it allows for capturing images regardless of the solar light on the site and the meteorological conditions.
This is particularly relevant for the monitoring of the Argentine Sea, the Province of Tierra del Fuego and the Antarctic, which are regularly covered by thick cloud layers.
Radar observation can also be used for soil studies (particularly for soil humidity measurements), an area in which INTA has long and valuable experience.
Microwave range observation are obviously applicable in matters related to national agricultural production and to the monitoring of fishing in the South Atlantic.
The microwave observation programme is a starting-point for the analysis and development of alternatives to the low-consumption radar, a major condition if the best use is to be made of the experience gained with the SAC line of light satellites.
This observation programme will be carried out with the SAOCOM (Satellites for Observation and Communications) satellite family series, in which the radar's useful load will be shared with that in communications, as described below.
The applications foreseen in the field of communications are aimed at solving deficiencies in extensive areas of the country as far as communications elements are concerned.
Adequate use of space communication technologies may result in solutions to many of the problems in rural environments and schools, in remote police stations and in distant hospitals and health-care centres.
They are also applicable in the maintenance of extensive power distribution networks and gas and oil pipelines.
This service must be aimed specifically at data transmission, electronic mail, connections with isolated settlements, and links with low-cost land platforms for the collection, control and recording of the most diverse types of data, such as agrometeorological, environmental, hydrological and industrial application data.
These matters are marginal for the telecommunications market in private hands, but they are considerably significant from strategic, economic and social standpoints.
Simultaneously, economically-sustainable innovative technological development projects may be carried out in this area on SAOCOM-type satellites.
V. Courses of action
The projects and activities defined above constitute a scheduled programme of actions to involve CONAE.
For planning, discussion and analysis purposes, they will be encompassed in the following five courses of action, thus associating each one of them with an equal number of broad segments in space activities:
‚óè Land infrastructure
‚óè Satellite systems
‚óè Data systems
‚óè Access to space
‚óè Institutional development and basic tasks.
A. Land infrastructure
This course of action contains all the tasks performed by CONAE with regard to ground stations for follow-up, telemetry and control of Earth links with satellites or spacecraft, laboratories for integration, tests and simulations and testing tables for satellite or spacecraft subsystems.
This includes the laboratories to be installed in the Te√≥filo M. Tabanera Space Centre at Falda del Carmen, Province of C√≥rdoba, and the telemetry and control systems for the follow-up of the satellites to be launched.
It also comprises the performance of a feasibility study and the startup of the facilities recommended for obtaining CONAE's own data or that offered internationally (Landsat, Spot, etc.) as well as for radioastronomical observations.
B. Satellite systems
This course of action includes all satellite missions, including the construction of satellites and platforms or space stations, as well as their subsystems for control, power generation, sensoring, communications etc.
As for experience gained in projecting and building satellites, Argentina will have a successful pro-gramme of light satellites, each weighing up to a ton, for scientific, remote sensing, communication and other purposes.
In our country, there are presently specific requirements in the areas of remote sensing and telecommunications that will not be satisfied by the systems offered internationally and that may be better satisfied by our own light satellites.
On an immediate basis, missions will be performed with mixed-purpose satellites, for remote sensing and scientific research.
Further on, this framework will be expanded to include satellites for microwave observation and communications (SAOCOM).
C. Data systems
This item comprises all the actions aimed at collecting, receiving and storing data from space systems, including the development and operation of hardware and software systems, of computer networks and of data centres.
Both public agencies and private enterprises in our country have gained considerable experience in communication and computer network technology, as well as in the best use of images and of satellite data.
Consequently, our country may well face development work concerning communications software and hardware, systems for database management, systems on geographically referenced applied data, database systems for computer-aided design and manufacturing and event software for highly diverse types of engineering calculations.
These are elements by which space activities may transfer their benefits to society, since they contain a great multiplying effect, allow for easy capitalisation of efforts and imply moderate investment costs.
On an immediate basis, this course of action shall emphasize the expansion of the service rendered by the Regional Center of Satellite Data (CREDAS) and the development of software concerning geographical data and image processing simulation.
D. Access to space
Any actions performed that allow access to space by the various satellites included in the space programme are included under this item.
Examples include feasibility studies and development, use and exploitation of spacecraft, which allow for the exploration and best use of extraterrestrial space.
This development work will be carried out within the framework of full transparency and taking into account the possibilities offered by international cooperation programmes, in accordance with Argentine policy on non-proliferation and with the international commitments assumed by our country in this area.
On an immediate basis, the possibility of using the local experience in conceptual engineering for the development of a new generation of spacecraft will be evaluated.
Such spacecraft should be used for supplementing previous undertakings concerning light satellites and should prove to be economically feasible, so that progress can be made towards a prototype within the first decade in the next century.
A constant follow-up of the international market in this sector will allow an assessment to be made of the best opportunities for the concentration of material and human resources in these matters of the space programme.
Any future undertakings regarding access to space will be in agreement with the guidelines under which CONAE was created, that is, rejecting any use of space activities for military offensives.
E. Institutional development and basic tasks
This course of action involves all the actions with regard to relations with other national and foreign institutions for the promotion, diffusion and utilisation of space techniques or for project development involving international cooperation.
CONAE's tasks related to the training of human resources, through its Mario Gulich Institute for Advanced Space Studies and other educational activities are also included under this item, especially its contribution to distant education programmes.
F. Development of human resources
The performance of training activities for human resources, aiming at satisfying the demand emerging from the actions scheduled in the space programme, is considered essential.
In order to undertake these tasks, CONAE will promote the development of its Mario Gulich Institute for Advanced Space Studies, so as to transform it into an interdisciplinary centre for the teaching of space sciences and of other related areas of knowledge.
The Institute will operate with the Te√≥filo M. Tabenera Space Centre at Falda del Carmen, Province of C√≥rdoba, providing courses specially tailored for satisfying CONAE's needs, as well as those of companies involved in space activities.
These courses will also be made available to students who are not directly associated with CONAE or with enterprises in this field.
The Institute will be given the juridical form considered most appropriate in order to attain maximum self-financing. FRANCE
[Original: French]
I. Space activities in France
France's space programmes have a large international cooperation component, whether multilateral, in particular under the aegis of the European Space Agency (ESA), or bilateral.
France thus has ongoing contacts with countries that have an extensive space sector, but is also developing scientific and technical cooperation activities with newcomers in the space field.
This report gives an overview of France's space-related activities from the period of mid-1994 to mid-1995.
Space-related work in France currently employs about 16,000 people, over 13,000 of whom are in the industrial sector.
Launcher-related activities are the most important, followed, as regards applications, by radiocommunications and Earth observation.
The French space industry is dominated by some 60 companies. The 20 largest account for nearly 95 percent of this industrial activity, while 70 percent of jobs are in the group of four space contractors (A√©rospatiale, Alcatel Espace, Matra Marconi Space and Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Propulsion).
II. The main civilian programmes
A. Space transportation and orbital infrastructure systems
1. ARIANE programme
The development of the ARIANE launcher family, under the aegis of the European Space Agency (ESA) and supervised by the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), has provided us with a high-performance transportation vehicle, produced and marketed by Arianespace, which also provides launch services.
Increasingly powerful versions have been developed, ranging from ARIANE-1, launched for the first time on 24 December 1979, to ARIANE-4, capable of launching 4.7 tons into geostationary transfer orbit in its most powerful configuration.
By 20 November 1995, the ARIANE launchers had clocked up 73 successful launches out of 80, including test launches.
Since 1988 ARIANE-4 has been launched 52 times with 49 successful launches, and has placed 63 satellites in orbit.
The new ARIANE-5 launcher has a dual purpose: first, to make the ARIANE family more competitive by enhancing performance levels, reducing launch costs, improving reliability and increasing the useful diameter under the fairing, so that ARIANE-5 will be capable of launching into geostationary transfer orbit either two 3,000 kilogram satellites simultaneously or a single satellite of up to 6,800 kilograms; second, to satisfy Europe's need for a low-orbit facility using manned vehicles or space station sections.
The development of ARIANE-5 began in late 1987.
The first test launch is planned for late April 1996 (flight 501) and the second for September 1996 (flight 502), before commercial operation can begin.
The last development work is currently being completed in Europe and the manufacture of the sections for flights 501 and 502 is well advanced.
The development trials on the Vulcain cryogenic engine are being pushed ahead in order to ensure the qualification of that essential part of the launcher without delay.
2. Space station
With regard to orbital infrastructure facilities, France is helping to define Europe's contribution to the international space station project.
The international situation has led the European Space Agency (ESA) to adjust the manned flight programme.
The October 1995 meeting of the Council of Ministers produced the following programme:
‚óè Development of the COLUMBUS orbital facility (COF).
‚óè Development of the automated transfer vehicle (ATV) launched by ARIANE-5.
‚óè Studies of a crew transport vehicle (CTV).
‚óè Readying the orbital laboratory for use.
This development programme should lead on to the operating period, from 2001 to 2013.
B. Radiocommunications
After the successful launch and commissioning of the TELECOM-2A (16 December 1991) and TELECOM-2B (15 April 1992) satellites and the work being done on TELECOM-2C, which is to be launched in 1995, France T√©l√©com and the French Armaments Office (DGA) ordered a fourth flight model, TELECOM-2D, in 1993 for launch in 1996.
This is part of the effort to provide expanded services by 2005, with at least two satellites in orbit.
CNES is also involved, with technical responsibility for the space segment and with responsibility for the operational status of the next two satellites, TELECOM-2C and TELECOM-2D.
In the field of telecommunication satellites, French industry has to cope with rapidly developing technologies and market requirements in a very competitive environment.
The various protagonists are aware of what is at stake and have joined forces to propose a technological programme with research and development activities, groundstation development, the STENTOR satellite and the incorporation of new technologies in industrial product lines.
In October 1994, the French Government decided to go ahead with the STENTOR programme.
The initial definition studies will be followed by programme implementation, aimed at the launching of the satellite by ARIANE-5 in the year 2000.
STENTOR, with a mass of between 1,600 and 1,800 kilograms and a power of the order of 1,800 W, will make maximum use of the latest technologies.
With reference to data collection and beacon location services, the ARGOS programme is being pursued with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America.
ARGOS has been used increasingly in the last decade and this trend is set to continue in the coming years with the implementation of major international ocean and weather study programmes.
As from 1996, these new instruments will triple the data-processing capacity.
The satellites will extend the service life beyond the year 2004.
The COSPAS-SARSAT search and rescue programme can be used to detect and pinpoint moving objects (particularly aircraft and ships) involved in disasters.
The programme involves extensive international cooperation and, so far, 20 countries have joined the four founding suppliers of the space segment: Canada, France, Russian Federation and United States.
Since 1982, the COSPAS-SARSAT programme has been instrumental in 1,649 rescue operations, in which 5,041 persons have been rescued (as at 31 December 1994).
One hundred thousand 406 MHz and about 555,000 121.5 MHz distress beacons are now in use around the world.
Satellite navigation systems are of considerable interest to the international civilian community, particularly civil aviation.
The American Global Positioning System (GPS) can no longer keep pace, particularly in civil aviation, with the need for location accuracy, security, availability and continuity of service and must be supplemented.
The use of geostationary satellites to supplement the GPS constellation, a technical concept resulting from several years of concerted effort by CNES and the French General Directorate for Civil Aviation, has finally been accepted internationally as the reference solution, above all by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
This configuration has been named the Global Navigation Satellite System, first generation (GNSS-1).
The European Commission, EUROCONTROL and ESA have taken the initiative of combining their efforts to develop a European satellite navigation programme that is beginning this year.
C. Earth observation
In the field of earth observation, France occupies a special and strong position with the Experimental Earth Observation System (SPOT) high-resolution optical imaging satellite programme, developed with Belgium and Sweden.
It was decided that the best approach was to develop and maintain an evolving operational network, run by a single commercial entity, SPOT IMAGE, a subsidiary of CNES.
The SPOT system already has three satellites in orbit, SPOT-1, -2 and -3.
In 1995, the operation availability level was remarkable, because of the combination of the excellent performance of the SPOT-3 satellite, launched on 26 September 1993, and the availability of SPOT-2, used to supplement SPOT-3 by direct reception stations, as indicated by SPOT IMAGE.
After almost 10 years in orbit, SPOT-1 still provides high-quality images and is a backup satellite that can be used by the direct reception stations within a few days.
The constellation will develop further with SPOT-4, due to be launched in late 1997.
The lifetime and recording capacity of SPOT-4 are superior to those of its predecessors and it will have a new spectrum band in the infrared range.
In addition, it will carry the ‚ÄúVegetation‚Äù payload co-funded by the European Union, Belgium, France, Italy and Sweden.
This wide-field and mid-resolution (1 km) imager will be used for repetitive and general continuous observation of the continental biosphere.
In October 1994, the Government decided to go ahead with the development of two new satellites, SPOT-5A and SPOT-5B.
The former should be launched in 2002 and the latter in 2007.
The decision guarantees users SPOT service continuity until 2012, essential for the lasting development and diversification of the operational applications and services with a value-added component, as well as environmental monitoring.
D. Earth sciences and environment
The STELLA laser reflecting satellite, launched in late September 1993 with SPOT-3, and the DORIS positioning system, carried on SPOT-2, -3, -4, -5A and -5B and on the ESA's ENVISAT mission, along with the participation by CNES in the Danish OERSTED programme to study the Earth's magnetic field, are expanding research in Earth sciences.
The use of DORIS in monitoring movements of the planet's tectonic plates has been informative and will be continued in the SPOT, TOPEX-POSEIDON and ENVISAT programmes.
The ALISSA project, in collaboration with the Russian Federation, primarily designed to provide a detailed description of the upper part of cloud systems, is to be placed aboard the Priroda module on the Mir station this year.
Work has begun on producing two instruments for the European ENVISAT-1 mission. DORIS, already on SPOT-2, -3 and -4, and TOPEX-POSEIDON will consolidate our precision orbitography studies, while SCARAB will be used to continue the radiation budget observations started on the Russian Meteor series satellites.
In 1996 the POLDER imaging polarization reflectance measuring instrument will be sent up on NASDA's ADEOS satellite, as part of a first joint project with Japan, and then on the ADEOS-2 satellite, due to be launched in 1999.
France is also planning to contribute to the World Climate Research Programme by developing two operational systems, namely the Topex/Poseidon Follow-On (TPFO) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Instrument (IASI).
TPFO is a series of altimetric mini-satellites designed to provide reasonably-priced continuity of the TOPEX/POSEIDON observations.
France is examining this possibility, in cooperation with the United States, as part of a line of products to construct mini-satellites from modular elements.
French and Italian research is currently being carried out into the definition of the IASI infrared sounder.
IASI is part of the basic payload of the operational meteorology (METOP) satellites.
By providing profiles of temperature, humidity and certain minor constituents of the atmosphere, it will contribute usefully to the World Climate Research Programme and answer the most pressing needs of operational numeric weather forecasting.
In the first few months of 1995, the French scientific community participated in the third stage of the European stratospheric balloon programme - the Second European Stratospheric Arctic and Mid-Latitude Experiment (SESAME) - aimed at studying the stratospheric ozone layer over the Arctic.
E. Space sciences
The past year was marked by a number of events.
The French and Russian SIGMA-GRANAT programme is being concluded in an exemplary manner.
Under the terms of this programme, France supplied the telescope for the gamma-ray study of the sky.
The scientific results obtained, in nearly four years' observation, are a step forward in our knowledge of the universe and, in particular, the centre of our galaxy.
The ULYSSES probe, an example of cooperation between Europe and the United States, flew by the south pole of the Sun.
This had never been done before and the data are being examined.
France is also involved in the international Global Geospace Science (GGS) programme to study the Sun's influence on the Earth's environment.
This programme uses several satellites, including WIND, which was launched in November 1994.
There will also be several important exchanges in the short term.
French engineers and scientists are making the necessary preparations.
The European Infrared Space Observatory was placed in orbit in November 1995.
The CLUSTER programme to measure the fine structure of the Earth's magnetosphere is due to be launched on board test flight 501 of the ARIANE 5 launcher in 1996.
Cooperation with the Russian Federation includes the first launch of the INTERBALL magnetosphere study programme, which should take place in the coming months.
Similarly, preparations for the MARS experiment have been proceeding, with delayed launch targets in 1996 or 1998, the dates of the next favourable planetary windows.
Considerable work has been done on preparations for future missions, in particular the European X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (X-ray astronomy) and Integral (gamma radiation) programmes, the international Cassini/Huygens mission to explore Saturn and Titan, or the European Rosetta mission to collect comet samples.
F. Physical sciences, life sciences and manned flights
Recent developments in this area in France include the introduction of gravitational physics, whose objectives are similar to those of astrophysics.
More conventional subjects, such as condensed matter physics in a weightless environment, more application-oriented subjects, such as the behaviour of fluids in orbit, have been the subject of several experiments in the past year.
The life sciences field is threefold: biology and basic physiology, space medicine, as applied to manned flight programmes, and exobiology, which is also emerging from the programmes to explore the solar system.
Several projects have been conducted in these different disciplines.
In addition to a programme of sub-orbital experiments, the physical sciences and life sciences projects have benefited from the use of recoverable satellites (principally the Gravitational Cell Biology Facility (IBIS) aboard the Russian Photon 10 capsule) and manned missions.
An example was the Spacelab International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) mission in July 1994, with a considerable French contribution, both in the field of bilateral cooperation and through the experiments conducted by ESA.
Mention should also be made of the Ramses project, involving cooperation between Belgium, France, Spain and the United States, to improve our understanding and mastery of the separation and purification of proteins in orbit.
France also has its own manned flight programme and is preparing the French and Russian Cassiop√©e mission, scheduled for 1996, for which two French astronauts have been selected.
They began their training at Star City in January 1995.
A French astronaut was chosen as backup for the IML-2 mission, while another French astronaut flew on behalf of ESA aboard the shuttle Atlantis on the international ATLAS-3 mission.
NORWAY I. Recognition of the importance of Norwegian space activities
As this Annual Report makes clear, Norwegian space activities are growing at a healthy rate, and the prospects for the future are promising.
The level of space activity per capita is very high, and it is highly export-oriented.
Membership of ESA is an important element in the further development of this sector.
The Office of the Auditor General has recently submitted a report to the Norwegian Parliament (Document No. 3:8 1994-95), which discusses the experience of four years' membership of ESA's Audit Commission.
The report concludes that ESA is an important industrial gateway to Europe, and that membership of ESA enables Norway to participate in several aspects of the European political network, not least in the global collaboration within environmental monitoring.
The report also refers to good results so far for Norwegian industry, and points out that Norwegian participation in ESA provides advanced tasks relative to the financial involvement.
On this basis, it concludes, Norwegian efforts in relation to ESA should be maintained at least at their current level.
The Auditor General's report recommends that the national ground infrastructure for space activities should be further developed, referring specifically to And√∏ya Rocket Range and Troms√∏ Satellite Station.
Such development is already under way, both at these two companies and in connection with other organizations such as EISCAT, which is completing the construction of its new radar on Svalbard this year.
It is well known that the world's highest concentration of infrastructure for auroral research already exists in Northern Norway and on Svalbard, because of the natural advantages.
The installations give considerable economic and scientific return of the national inputs.
Collaboration with the Swedish Space Corporation on the ownership side of Earth observation services means that the Swedish-Norwegian infrastructure is the biggest in Europe in this area; major challenges and prospects lie ahead of us, including the prospect of new activities on Svalbard.
The Auditor General's conclusions are a clear recognition of ESA as a means to achieve economical growth, of the work of the Norwegian actors, and of the national goals and strategies that underlie the national efforts.
II. Report of the Board of Directors
A. Introduction
The Norwegian Space Centre is a foundation consisting of three units: the Oslo Headquarters is responsible for the national coordination of space activities and Norway's interests vis-a-vis ESA, and it is primarily financed via the budget of the Ministry of Industry and Energy.
And√∏ya Rocket Range and Troms√∏ Satellite Station are run on a commercial basis, and their revenues are derived from national and international contracts.
And√∏ya Rocket Range is responsible for the operation of the rocket range and the development of ancillary services.
Its principal activities consist of launching scientific rockets on contract to research groups that carry out campaigns dedicated to studies of the middle and upper atmosphere.
Troms√∏ Satellite Station is responsible for operation of the COSPAS/SARSAT rescue service on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, as well as for acquisition of Earth observation data and related services in connection with national and ESA programmes.
B. Activities in 1994
The principal objectives of the Norwegian space sector are to create an annual rate of industrial growth of 15 percent, to meet the needs of national users, achieve leading international positions in space research, and play a leading role in space-related ground infrastructure activities.
Membership of the European Space Agency (ESA) is an effective means of achieving these goals.
The areas of concentration are those in which Norway is capable of making an international contribution, and are based to a great extent on national prerequisites and requirements.
The total turnover of Norwegian space-related products and services increased by 4 percent between 1991 and 1994.
ESA contracts with Norwegian companies have also increased significantly during the past few years.
Registered contracts rose to 13 percent higher than the level of participation can "demand", and that shows that Norwegian industry and business have managed to obtain a very good position relative to European competitors and that they have demonstrated their competitiveness.
These contracts include a larger share of advanced technology than most other countries that cooperate with ESA.
Collaboration with ESA has also resulted in a number of spin-off effects in the shape of profitable deliveries of products and services to other markets both within the space sector and in other industries. By 1994, the investment of effort in ESA since 1985 had resulted in an industrial turnover more than four times the size of the financial investment involved.
The Board regards this as a very satisfactory result.
More than 50 percent of the national Earth observation programme is currently financed by user groups.
A preliminary evaluation of this programme has given a good basis for future work.
In collaboration with national actors a national plan has been drawn up for the development of new services via preoperational running of marine and environmental applications, and based on the use of radar satellites.
The further development of space activities based on ground infrastructure in Northern Norway is assuming ever greater importance.
In the course of the past few years, Troms√∏ Satellite Station has considerably increased its turnover, and it made another solid profit in 1994.
In 1994, Troms√∏ Satellite Station laid the foundations for a contract regarding rights to acquire data from the Canadian RADARSAT radar satellite.
The turnover of And√∏ya Rocket Range has also increased, and the Range also made a good profit in 1994.
International marketing is producing results and a further development of the range of activities is expected.
The new ALOMAR lidar observatory for middle atmosphere observations, particularly for continuous ozone measurements, is the object of a great deal of international interest.
It commenced operations in 1994.
In Norwegian space research, scientific priorities and their financing are the responsibility of the Research Council of Norway, while the Norwegian Space Centre provides technical and managerial support, primarily via ESA projects.
In 1994, the Research Council carried out an independent evaluation of Norwegian space research with the help of an international group.
Although this evaluation came to positive conclusions, the financial contribution of the Research Council of Norway has been reduced to a level at which it is impossible for Norwegian scientists to participate in new ESA projects starting in 1995-98.
A solution to this problem is urgently required.
C. Collaboration with the Swedish Space Corporation
Troms√∏ Satellite Station is facing important challenges, for example in connection with the preparation of a business concept based on Canada's new RADARSAT radar satellite.
In order to achieve greater breadth and weight in the Earth observation market, the Norwegian Space Centre has signed a collaborative agreement with the Swedish Space Corporation.
The collaboration implies the establishment of Troms√∏ Satellite Station as a limited company, which will be jointly owned by the Norwegian Space Centre and the Swedish Space Corporation.
The agreement was approved by the Norwegian Ministry of Industry and Energy on 3 March 1995.
D. Plans for the future
In autumn 1995, ESA once again held a meeting of its Council, at which the continuation of major programmes such as the space science and space station programmes, as well as follow-up programmes for Ariane-5, were resolved.
There is some uncertainty regarding the scope and content of these programmes.
The telecommunications and Earth observation programmes will continue with acceptable timetables and budgets.
The Norwegian Space Centre will primarily utilize the ESA programmes to continue its efforts to meet national objectives.
The Norwegian Space Centre will continue to implement measures that have the aim of concentrating on those main actors and areas of activity that make the greatest contribution to achieving national goals.
One such area is satellite-based navigation, in which the Board has recommended that Norway should participate in a relevant new ESA project (Artes 9).
The Norwegian Space Centre will thereby involve itself to a greater extent in this area, which is expected to assume ever greater national and international significance.
It is of particular importance to exploit the potential involved in the development of new services.
The Board regards it as being of decisive importance to maintain national space-related projects to meet user requirements, and as "locomotives" in the development of national industrial competitiveness.
For this purpose, it is essential to continue the Space Centre's national support programmes for industrial development and the development of services and infrastructure at least at the level gained in 1995 after extraordinary grants.
The Norwegian Space Centre will continue to utilize the support programmes to promote cooperation among national actors, and to further encourage companies that have shown themselves to be capable of competing in international markets and which have developed the necessary technological competence and market orientation.
The Norwegian Space Centre is placing increasing emphasis on ensuring that the good results of ESA collaboration will lead to further industrial growth on commercial conditions, and extra funding was allocated for this purpose in 1995.
And√∏ya Rocket range will intensify the marketing of its services to user groups in Germany, Japan and the United States.
As a result of the expansion in commercial activity, the number of staff was increased at both Troms√∏ Satellite Station and And√∏ya Rocket Range in 1995.
In spring 1995, the Norwegian Space Centre took measures to bring the establishment of space activity infrastructure on Svalbard a stage further.
A preliminary evaluation of the possibility of setting up a satellite station was made available in mid-March 1995.
Rocket launches from Svalbard await the permission of the Governor of Svalbard.
E. The Board
The Board of the Norwegian Space Centre held six meeting in 1994.
F. The Council
The Council is an advisory body for the Norwegian Space Centre's management and Board.
It is made up of representatives of industry, users and research.
The Council held two meetings in 1994.
G. Organization and personnel
And√∏ya Rocket Range had a staff of 27 at the end of 1994.
The number of staff at Troms√∏ Satellite Station at the end of 1994 was 26.
Headquarters' activities were reorganized on 1 February 1994 and now focus more sharply on the primary national goals.
In 1994, the number of staff at Headquarters was 21.
A joint meeting has been held with the Work Environment and Cooperation Committees of all three units.
The Norwegian Space Centre places great emphasis on a good working environment for its staff and on a good external environment.
In the opinion of the Board, the working environment is good at all three units.
The environmental effects of exhaust gases from rocket launches at And√∏ya Rocket Range were well within accepted norms.
III. Activities
A. Industry
1994 was a turbulent year for ESA.
The Space Station Programme in particular has suffered major changes and budget cuts, and this has had important consequences for the European space industry.
However, Norwegian companies have emerged well from this difficult period, partly because many of their tasks dealt with early phases of the programmes, and partly because Norwegian industry is competitive.
Among ESA's brighter points are the Space Transportation Programme and the construction of Ariane-5, which by and large are going according to plan.
The products of Norwegian participating companies have qualified and the first deliveries have been made.
Competition is very tough, even for small contracts, and countries are much more careful than they used to be to obtain advantages and contracts for their own industries.
The German authorities are exploiting the space sector to build up high-technology companies in what used to be the German Democratic Republic, and Norwegian companies have already found partners there.
A number of Norwegian industrial companies have qualified as suppliers to the space segment.
Norwegian industry is participating actively in ESA's new standardization project, European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS).
This initiative is based on the development of a single integrated set of cost-effective standards for use in all European space programmes.
The initiative has been extremely successful.
France has already decided to use it as its national standard and Germany is expected to follow.
Cooperation is also under way with CEN (Comit√© Europ√©en de Normalisation) with the intention of making ECSS a European standard.
Since the United States of America is in the process of dismantling its system of military standards, the ECSS standard will assume greater international importance.
There have already been requests from China and the Russian Federation to take part in the process.
In spite of the tough competitive climate, 1994 was a good year for the Norwegian space industry.
There was a growth in ESA contracts, Norway having one of the highest rates of industrial return in ESA.
The accumulated sum was 13 percent higher than the level of participation suggested should be the case.
This demonstrated that Norwegian industry managed to obtain a very good position relative to its competitors, and that it demonstrated its competitiveness.
These contracts also had a very high "weighting factor", i.e. they included a higher proportion of advanced technology than many other nations in ESA.
The total turnover of Norwegian space-related products and services rose by 16 percent between 1993 and 1994.
The mean annual increase between 1990 and 1994 was 18 percent.
About 80 percent of the total was exported.
ESA collaboration has been responsible for considerable spin-offs in the form of profitable deliveries of products and services to both space-related and other markets.
The Norwegian Space Centre carries out annual evaluations of what companies have achieved via their contracts for ESA.
Preliminary results of these evaluations show that the accumulated spinoffs have reached a factor of 4.4.
This means that total investments in ESA contracts since 1985 have generated a total turnover that is almost 4.4 times as large as the monetary input.
This may be regarded as a very satisfactory result.
Participants in the Norwegian space sector also emphasize the importance of ESA collaboration as a very suitable instrument for the transfer of technology, quality improvements, extended international cooperation and as a quality reference for individual companies. B. Telecommunications
For some time, telecommunications has been by far the largest area of Norwegian space activity, making up some two thirds of the national turnover of space-related products and services.
Sales in satellite communications increased by 20 percent compared with the previous year's figure.
Telenor and ABB Nera are still the dominant players in this field, particularly where Inmarsat products and services are concerned.
However, Norway obtained good and promising results in 1994 in other fields as well.
Nera has had great success with its user terminal for Inmarsat Standard M, which was launched at the end of 1993.
This compact attach√©-case satellite telephone is the first generation of truly portable satellite telephones.
An important component of this terminal is an electronic circuit developed by ABB Teknologi under the terms of an ESA contract.
Nera's product has been given a good reception, and the company currently has more than 30 percent of this rapidly growing market for terminals.
AME Space has continued its efforts to develop itself technologically, industrially and in market terms as a leading supplier of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filters and signal-processing modules for communications satellites.
This company is currently making major deliveries of electronics of this type to ESA satellites.
At the same time, AME Space has signed development contracts with ESA and the Norwegian Space Centre regarding the development and adaptation of its technology for applications in the next generation of advanced communications satellites.
AME Space has also signed commercial contracts to supply SAW filters to the Telekom-2 and Hotbird satellites.
The company has also won contracts with both Hughes and Loral for the development of SAW filter modules for personal mobile communications.
Normarc has continued to develop and industrialize its TSAT-2000 system in close collaboration with ESA and the Norwegian Space Centre.
TSAT-2000 is a cost-effective system for low-rate data transmission via satellite.
In the course of the year Normarc has made an international breakthrough for TSAT-2000 via two important commercial contracts in Germany.
One is for a system for monitoring gas pipelines, while the second is a communications system for service station pay terminals.
Since 1992, Nera has been a member of a European industrial consortium which supplies a satellite communication system (MERCURE) to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
Final agreement on implementation of the project was reached.
An important part of the system is based on Nera's satellite communication system SuperViSAT.
This contract is a direct result of work done in the course of previous ESA projects, and it is an important international breakthrough for SuperViSAT.
In the course of 1994, ESA established cooperation with the Commission of the European Communities and Eurocontrol regarding a European programme on satellite-based navigation.
The primary aim will be to implement a superstructure to the Global Positioning System (GPS) to improve its accuracy, reliability and accessibility.
Studies will also be carried out to define a second-generation civilian system that will be capable of taking over for GPS in 15 to 20 years.
Development is taking place under the auspices of ESA, as an element of the Telecommunications Programme.
Norway has decided to participate in the programme in order to ensure that national users, service suppliers and industry will be able to participate in this development and exploit the programme as a platform for their commercial activity.
C. The Space Station
The International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) is a collaborative project involving Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States, as well as ESA.
The integration of the individual elements of ISSA in space is planned for 1998-2002.
The European space laboratory known as the Columbus Orbital Facility (COF) is due to be installed as part of the station in 2002.
Economic problems in several ESA member states have led to a reduction in the planned European contribution to the station.
The proposed programme currently consists for the most part of a reduced space laboratory, COF, and the unmanned Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), while the manned transportation capsule has been abandoned.
The final decision regarding the development programme for the European elements was to be made at the ESA council meeting at the ministerial level in autumn 1995.
The scope of the utilization phase after development has been completed and how operating costs are to be shared among the partners are currently being defined.
ESA is trying to ensure that the European contribution will be met by using Ariane-5 and ATV to supply the station.
A final decision is to be made in 1998.
Norwegian development activities have primarily been concentrated on the involvement of Informationkontroll and Cap Computas in VICOS (Verification, Integration and Check-out Software).
In collaboration with Belgium and German companies, a system has been developed that will ensure uniform testing of the laboratory module, from the individual component up to the complete unit.
VICOS will also be used in the development of the American and Russian elements of the Space Station.
The structure of the system makes it relatively simple to adapt for use in the development of other platforms and satellites, as well as for other complex non-space elements, and Cap Computas has already signed a contract with the United States to adapt the system to the Americans' development of space-station elements.
Marintek has continued to develop logistic systems in which a range of operative scenarios are developed and tested.
These activities have had visible spin-off effects in the areas of computing, testing and documentation systems, and offshore and marine activities, respectively.
Four experiments were carried out in 1994.
The freon experiment from the Technical University of Norway was launched on board a Minitexus sounding rocket from Esrange.
Two experiments from the Departments of Physics and Botany at the University of Trondheim flew on the Space Shuttle's IML-2 flight.
A Canadian parabolic flight which included experiments integrated by the Norwegian Institute of Geotechnology was performed on an ESA Caravelle flight.
D. Space transportation
Norway's most important involvement in space transportation is via its participation in ESA's development of the new European launcher Ariane-5.
The first two launches for qualification of the Ariane-5 are to take place in spring 1996.
Thereafter, Ariane-5 will enter operational service in the commercial launch market.
Following an interim phase, during which it will be used in parallel with Ariane-4, a rate of five launches a year is expected from the year 2000.
Norsk Forsvarsteknologi, Raufoss Technology and AME Space are carrying out important development contracts for the Ariane-5 programme in the fields of mechanical structures, space-qualified electronics and rocket engines.
These contracts were won in the face of fierce competition, and the companies concerned have demonstrated that they are capable of competing with well-established European space concerns.
The companies are up to schedule and are already producing elements for the first launch.
Stentofon is a member of an international consortium that is developing communications equipment for the launch base in Kourou in French Guiana.
This equipment forms part of a network for the reception and distribution of operational information in connection with Ariane launches.
The company has already supplied similar equipment for the Ariane-5 control centre.
Although Arianespace currently has more than 50 percent of the free launch market, the entrance of new international actors has led to stiffer competition.
ESA has therefore been studying follow-up activities for Ariane-5.
These are regarded as essential to secure the market position of the rocket, and they include a programme for increasing the capacity of the rocket to put payloads into geostationary transfer orbit from 6 to 7.4 tons.
If all goes according to plan, the programmes will be put into effect in 1996.
Norway participates in ESA's FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigation Programme), which started in 1994.
This programme studies the technology which will be needed to enable redeployable transportation systems which can follow Ariane-5 to be developed.
Since 1991, Norway has been involved in similar activities via its participation in the German Hypersonic Technology Programme.
This cooperation has given Raufoss Technology important new opportunities to supply advanced aluminium materials to the aerospace market.
E. Earth observation
In Europe, the applications of Earth observation data were highly focused in 1994.
In this connection, a concept known as the European Earth Observation System (EEOS) has been developed, with the aim of improving the utilization of Earth observation data via joint European activity.
The main contributors to the concept are the EU, ESA and its members, via their national programmes.
The contribution of the EU will be a user-oriented network for the exchange of Earth observation information.
ESA will contribute the ground infrastructure for acquisition and processing of data from its own satellites and from other selected satellites.
A division of responsibility concerning the development of new applications has still to be drawn up.
Both the EU and ESA are keen to increase their activities in this area considerably.
More and more of the national programmes are also focusing more sharply on operational and commercial applications.
This rise in attention has led to greater interest in bilateral collaboration with Norway, which has long been regarded as one of the most goal-oriented countries in Europe as regards the development of operational near real-time services.
The principal features of the new national programme for development of Earth observation services has been given a positive international reception.
In descending order of priority, the following SAR-based services are to be established, given that this can be done in a cost-effective manner:
‚óè Ship detection for the Norwegian Navy and for the Coastguard
‚óè Oil detection for the State Pollution Control Authority (SFT) and oil companies
‚óè Ice mapping and monitoring for users who operate in the vicinity of the ice edge
‚óè Wave energy and direction spectra for the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI) in order to improve the special wave service.
These priorities have been drawn up on the basis of market evaluations, national advantages, and demonstrations based on ERS-1 data carried out in 1994.
In summer 1994, Troms√∏ Satellite Station took over the main responsibility for the oil-monitoring service.
As a result, TSS analysed more than 1,700 SAR images (equivalent to 1.7 million square kilometres) during the latter half of the year and sent reports to SFT of all possible cases of oil-slicks.
SFT has been an active partner and a source of finance for the establishment of satellite data as a component of the national oil-monitoring service.
Several research institutes have helped to automate the routines involved, and to utilize data from RADARSAT, a Canadian operational radar satellite which was launched in November 1995.
In collaboration with SFT, TSS has started international marketing of its SAR-based oil-monitoring services.
Ice mapping and monitoring have been performed regularly in high-priority areas around Svalbard and along the ice edge.
This service has been provided by Terra Orbit.
The service has received positive feedback, but severe limitations in coverage and flexibility have made it difficult to obtain financing.
RADARSAT is expected to offer considerable improvements in quality.
DNMI cooperates with NORUT-IT and Troms√∏ Satellite Station in analysing and documenting how wave energy and wave direction information can be extracted from SAR data.
These parameters are of importance for maritime activities, and the results of this work are expected to improve the quality of wave forecasts.
A product and service concept for ship routing has been demonstrated by DNMI and Maintek.
The Norwegian shipping industry has reacted positively to the concept.
Industrial partners and a market strategy have been identified.
TSS has won a position as an important supplier of marine near real-time services.
The station has demonstrated a number of services in close collaboration with users, R & D institutes and industrial companies.
In order to strengthen the market development of Troms√∏ Satellite Station close collaboration has been initiated with the Swedish Space Corporation.
In 1995, the Swedish Space Corporation became a co-owner of Troms√∏ Satellite Station a.s (TSS) together with the Norwegian Space Centre.
The Norwegian Space Centre has set up the Svalsat project, which will study the prospects for establishing a ground station for polar orbiting satellites on Svalbard.
The project group has consisted of representatives of TSS, DNMI, Telenor, Svalbard n√¶ringsutvikling and Spacetec.
On the industrial side, Spacetec and Informasjonkontroll are in the process of setting up a new production chain for RADARSAT at TSS.
The two companies have been awarded a contract in Singapore for equipment for a satellite ground station, including a SAR processor.
Spacetec has also been awarded contracts in China and South Africa.
In the ENVISAT-1 programme, Norsk Forsvarsteknologi and Norsk Elektro Optikk are developing important components for the spectrometer, while AME Space will supply electronics for the radar altimeter.
The Meteosat Second Generation Programme has inaugurated phase B activities.
AME Space, Raufoss and Det norske Veritas are strong candidates as suppliers of processors, valves and quality assurance systems.
F. Space research
In the space science sector, the Norwegian Space Centre looks after the interests of Norwegian scientists vis-a-vis ESA and other international partners.
Research groups are offered technical and administrative support for their projects.
The Norwegian Space Centre plays a core role in implementing major pilot projects of national interest.
National financing of research is the responsibility of the Research Council of Norway, but the Norwegian Space Centre has made financial contributions to the industrial parts of the research projects when these match general industrial priorities.
Much of the efforts with respect to ESA has concerned the preparation of "Horizon 2000+", the new long-term plan for the research programme.
In 1994, the German-Norwegian cooperative programme TURBO came to a successful conclusion with the launch of two sounding rockets from And√∏ya Rocket Range.
Preparations for RONALD, the successor to the TURBO programme, are on schedule, with launches due to start in 1996.
In early 1994, the PULSAUR II payload was launched from And√∏ya.
This programme was another scientific success.
PULSAUR II is the biggest payload ever to have been built by Norwegian scientists.
Norwegian scientific and industrial deliveries to the SOHO and Cluster projects were made on schedule in 1994.
A large-scale pilot project for a Norwegian research satellite has been carried out.
This project is known as the Norwegian Ionospheric Small Satellite Experiment (NISSE), and its objective is to study energy exchange between the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere and near-space.
The scientific leadership of the project is in the hands of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE), and all space physics groups in Norway are participants.
The pilot project was carried out with the support of the research groups and industry (Cap Computas, EIDEL, NFT, SINTEF and NTH), in addition to the Norwegian Space Centre and the Research Council of Norway.
The results of the project have been given a very good international evaluation.
NISSE can be launched in 1998 if financing is obtained in time.
Comprehensive studies of the prospects of establishing a sub-station of And√∏ya Rocket Range on Svalbard to launch sounding rockets have been carried out.
The industrial rate of return on ESA's science programme is now about 0.95.
Preparations for participation in the new ESA programmes XMM and INTEGRAL were carried out in 1994.
A rate of return slightly above unity is expected on these projects.
Scientific participation in INTEGRAL is possible, if the Research Council of Norway sets aside sufficient funding for the space research programme.
During 1994, it became evident that the national financing of the scientific exploitation of the ESA membership was insufficient to ensure a desirable degree of participation in new projects.
Studies of the prospects of increasing the availability of resources were initiated, with the aim of clarifying the situation.
G. And√∏ya Rocket Range
And√∏ya Rocket Range (ARR) had another successful financial year as a result of the whole organization's goal-oriented efforts and cost-consciousness.
ARR marketing has become more goal-oriented, and is a continuing process that aims to guarantee the future of the range.
Establishment of new services are being worked out to make the range less economically vulnerable.
In order to increase the clients' confidence in the services of ARR even further, a quality assurance system will be set up.
Two new members of staff joined ARR in 1994, bringing the total number of employees to 26.
In the course of 1994, ARR launched 19 rockets, of which seven were instrumented and 12 were for meteorological purposes.
Four research balloons were also released.
The Norwegian/American rocket campaign known as PULSAUR II was successfully carried out in January and February 1994.
The University of Bergen was responsible for this project.
The aim of the campaign was to study auroral pulsation, and it was a follow-up of a similar campaign in 1980.
A rocket campaign for the Japanese Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS) was successfully carried out at the end of February 1994.
In spring 1994, two research balloons for France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) were released; these measured the ozone layer.
This balloon campaign was a collaborative project between CNRS and ARR, in which CNRS's interests were scientific, while ARR wished to demonstrate that it possessed the expertise for this type of service.
The releases were very successful in both scientific and technical terms, and they have resulted in more contracts to release balloons for CNRS and for the University of Wyoming in the United States.
In summer 1994, the Norwegian/German TURBO project launched three instrumented and 12 meteor-ological rockets.
The principal partners were NDRE and the Universities of Troms√∏ and Bonn.
The University of Stockholm also had an instrument on board.
The campaign was successful, with two of the payloads being recovered and available for further rocket campaigns in the future.
Two successful rocket launches for ISAS were performed in November 1994.
These had the aim of studying auroral pulsation and making ozone measurements.
Five periods of measurement with lidar instruments were carried out in 1994.
These measurements were made by the University of Bonn, whose personnel spent a total of 408 working days on the range.
In August 1994, for the first time, a course in space technology and space research for secondary school teachers was offered.
The course was organized in collaboration with the Norwegian Space Centre's Headquarters in Oslo and the University of Oslo.
A working seminar on the use of satellite data in schools was also held in August.
Technical projects of importance for the development of the range's services are:
‚óè The task of upgrading the ALOMAR observatory started on 7 June 1993, when the foundation stone was laid by the late Foreign Minister J. J√∏rgen Holst.
The observatory was officially opened on 16 July 1994 by Germany's Minister of Science P. Kr√ºger and State Secretary B. Pettersen of the Ministry of Environment.
ALOMAR is a collaborative project that involves a number of Norwegian and foreign research groups.
The observatory, which will have five laser systems, of which three are already operational, as well as a number of ground measurement systems, is unique.
It is fully financed, with the Norwegian share provided by the Norwegian Industrial and Regional Development Fund, the Ministry of Local Government and Labour, and NSC/ARR.
‚óè The new launch pad (U3) for rocket configurations of up to 20 tons was put into operation in January 1994.
‚óè The planning of a mobile launch facility for research rockets at Ny-√Ölesund on Svalbard started in autumn 1993.
The aim is to be able to offer launch services by 1996/97.
This will offer research groups a unique opportunity to launch rockets both along and across magnetic field lines in the polar cleft.
‚óè Studies of a launch facility for small polar orbiting satellites are continuing in the form of a Norwegian/Swedish collaborative project.
Technical studies are being carried out, and a suitable launcher is being identified.
This project is being led by a steering group that consists of personnel from NSC and the Swedish Space Corporation.
A national network for environmental data from northern regions is being established, and ARR is heavily involved in the planning process.
Among other things, the possibility of setting up a service based on drones (remote-controlled, unmanned aircraft) equipped with a range of sensors, is being evaluated.
H. Troms√∏ Satellite Station
Troms√∏ Satellite Station (TSS) had another good financial year in 1994.
This was due to cost consciousness, good financial control and a highly competent and motivated staff.
TSS operates on the basis of the same strategic objectives as before, and focuses on selected aspects of environmental monitoring.
The strategic areas of concentration include supply of near real-time operational services for maritime applications.
The development of services is concentrated on three main areas; monitoring of oil-spills, ocean ice and waves.
Monitoring maritime oil pollution is the most promising project, and this was given the highest priority in 1994.
The project has now evolved from the demonstration phase to a pilot service, and it has been developed in good cooperation with the end-user, the State Pollution Control Authority.
This project has also aroused considerable international interest, which is being exploited in the marketing process.
COSPAS/SARSAT LUT is run as a contract service for the Ministry of Justice and the National Search and Rescue Service and is TSS's most important single contract.
The collaboration with the Rescue Coordination Centre North Norway in Bod√∏ regarding development and operation of this service is very good.
Marketing was greatly stepped up in 1994.
A Head of marketing department/Assistant Managing Director was appointed, and the marketing department was expanded to six persons.
On 1 January 1994, TSS took over responsibility for the marketing and sale of TSS data from Spacetec.
The marketing department thus became responsible for the marketing and sale of all products and services from TSS.
The marketing efforts have already had positive results.
Preparations for the reception and processing of data from RADARSAT have been made in a number of areas.
A new 10-metre antenna was installed during summer 1995.
Contracts for the supply of other items of reception and processing equipment were awarded to Norwegian companies; these were due for delivery before the satellite was declared operational in December 1995.
Negotiations have been held with Radarsat International, which owns the commercial rights to the data.
Some of these negotiations have been difficult.
The cooperation with the Swedish Space Corporation has been of great importance for the successful accomplishment of these negotiations, which continued in 1995 with the aim of reaching agreement as soon as possible.
The station's main antenna was upgraded in 1994, when mechanical and electro-mechanical parts were replaced.
The replacement of wear items has now been completed, and an adequate store of spare parts has been built up.
With its new antenna, TSS is now a data acquisition station with competitive abilities within reliability as well as quality.
A considerable proportion of TSS's income comes from ESA contracts for acquisition, processing and storing of SAR data from the Japanese JERS-1 satellite, ATSR data from ERS-1 and AVHRR data from the NOAA satellites.
As a result of ESA's financial problems, this source of income has come under pressure, and this gives reason for worries.
It is therefore of vital importance to establish alternative types of commercial activity.
One important possibility in this connection is the establishment of a satellite station on Svalbard that would be capable of providing main station services for satellite operators such as EUMETSAT and NASA.
This project has been given the name of Svalsat and it has met a positive reception from both EUMETSAT and NASA.
On the national level, efforts have concentrated on securing the necessary finance for the investments.
Svalsat has the potential to become a cost-effective ground station, and it could be a source of long-term operating contracts for TSS.
In conjunction with positive developments of operational services, first and foremost based on SAR data, Svalsat could ensure that TSS would enjoy a good financial and scientifically interesting future. RUSSIAN FEDERATION

I. National space activities
The space activities of the Russian Federation in 1995 were conducted under its Federal Space Programme and also as part of international scientific-technical cooperation and commercial agreements.
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network (comprising telecommunications and television, the Mir manned orbital station, space research and technological development, navigational safety, tracking of vessels in distress, topographic geodesy and cartography, and remote sensing of the Earth) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability, further developing science and technology, improving the country's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities.
This space programme was conducted by the Russian Space Agency (RSA) in collaboration with the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Ministries of Defence, of Communications, of Cartography, and of Hydrology and Meteorology and other clients and users of space information and products.
During 11 months in 1995, 32 space facilities of various kinds were launched, including:
‚óè 17 artificial Earth satellites from the Cosmos series (Cosmos 2306 to Cosmos 2322);
‚óè Two manned spacecraft from the Soyuz TM series (Soyuz TM-21 and Soyuz TM-22);
‚óè The Spektr research module for the Mir manned station;
‚óè The Prognoz-M2 unmanned scientific station;
‚óè Four unmanned cargo spacecraft from the Progress-M series (Progress M-26 to Progress M-29); and
‚óè One satellite each from the Gals, Luch-1, Molniya-3, Foton, Tsikada, Resurs-F and Sich-1 series.
The above-mentioned space facilities were placed in orbit by 28 launches from Cosmos, Molniya, Proton, Soyuz and Tsiklon carrier rockets.
In the case of two launches of satellites in the Cosmos series, three satellites were placed in orbit each time by a single carrier rocket:
‚óè 7 March - three satellites (Cosmos-2307 to Cosmos-2309); and
‚óè 24 July - three satellites (Cosmos-2316 to Cosmos-2318).
A. Manned space flight programme
Work connected with the Mir manned scientific research station continued.
During 1995, crews from four Russian principal expeditions (the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th) and two international crews (Russian-American and Russian-Western European) worked on the Mir station, which has been operating in the Earth's orbit since 1986.
The programme of work performed by the crew of the 17th principal expedition (cosmonauts A. Viktorenko, E. Kondakova and V. Polyakov) during the period from October 1994 to March 1995 included operations in basic areas of contemporary space science such as medicine, geophysics, astrophysics and space materials science.
On 11 January 1995, the cosmonauts carried out checks of the Kurs and radioelectronic docking system mounted on a connecting section of the station.
The experiment was performed using the Soyuz TM-20 transport craft, which - with the cosmonauts on board - separated from the orbital station, travelling a distance of 160 metres from it.
Subsequent operations, including the berthing and docking of the craft with the station, were performed by automatic flight control.
The Soyuz TM-20 craft was in independent flight for a period of 26 minutes.
On 6 February 1995, the cosmonauts assisted in completing the main phase of the flight programme of the American craft Discovery, during which it was brought closer to the Mir orbital station.
The purpose of this operation was to test the technical mechanisms and apparatus to be used in docking the Shuttle multi-mission craft with the Mir station.
In the final phase of this work the cosmonauts collaborated with the Russian-American crew (cosmonauts V. Dezhurov and G. Strekalov and the American astronaut N. Thagard), who arrived at the Mir station on board the Soyuz-TM 20.
The joint flight programme of the five Russian cosmonauts and the American astronaut included biomedical research under the Mir-Shuttle programme, experiments to determine the properties of structural materials exposed to open-space conditions and also the assembly at the Mir station of a number of scientific instruments intended for various experiments and studies under the continuing joint flight programme.
On 22 March 1995, upon completion of the 17th principal expedition, which lasted 169 days, the cosmonauts A. Viktorenko, E. Kondakova and V. Polyakov returned to Earth on the Soyuz TM-20.
The cosmonaut, research scientist and medical doctor, V. Polyakov, who had begun his sojourn in space on 8 January 1994 as a member of what was then the 15th principal expedition, completed a record flight lasting 437 days, 18 hours.
The work of the 18th principal expedition (cosmonauts V. Dezhurov and G. Strekalov and the American astronaut Norman Thagard), which lasted 115 days, included experiments in extra-atmospheric astronomy and biomedical and geophysical research foreseen under the Russian-American Mir-Shuttle programme.
During the flight, V. Dezhurov and G. Strekalov made five space walks under open-space conditions.
During the first three walks they performed operations aimed at disassembling and transferring the reusable solar-cell array from the Kristall module to the Kvant module, and connecting it to the orbital station's main power system.
During the last two walks operations were performed in preparation for redocking the Kristall module so that new space facilities could be docked with the Mir station, namely the Spektr research module and the Atlantis, an American reusable spacecraft.
The total duration of the operations performed in open space was 19 hours, 9 minutes.
During the final phase of its mission, the 18th principal expedition collaborated with the international American-Russian crew (American astronauts R. Gibson, C. Precourt, E. Baker, G. Harbaugh and B. Dunbar and the Russian cosmonauts A. Solovyov and N. Budarin), who arrived at the Mir station on board the Atlantis on 29 June 1995.
As a result of the docking of the Atlantis with the Russian Mir research station it was possible for the first time ever to place a large-scale space system of around 210 tons' mass in the Earth's orbit.
The docking and joint flight of the Mir station and the Atlantis demonstrated the potential scientific and technical benefits to be gained from setting up an international manned station.
This docking operation by completion of the tracking, approach and guidance of the flight of the Discovery and the Mir station was preceded in February 1995.
The rendezvous between the spacecraft in orbit took place in several stages.
First of all, the Discovery's approach to the Mir station was conducted by remote control, after which the manoeuvring of the craft was transferred to the command of the Discovery.
In subsequent operations the Discovery carried out manoeuvres including an approach of ten metres to the docking unit mounted on the Kristall module, a flight around the manned station and departure from the station.
At all stages of the joint flight the crews of both spacecraft maintained two-way radio communication, gave television reports, took photographs and made video recordings.
Specialists at the Houston and Kaliningrad (near Moscow) mission control centres were responsible for directing the dynamic operations performed in orbit.
The flight programme of the four Russian cosmonauts and six American astronauts included joint scientific and technical research and experiments under the Mir-Shuttle programme.
In particular, as part of the scientific wing of the flight programme, the Russian cosmonauts collaborated with the American astronauts in conducting a cycle of biomedical experiments aimed at studying the effect of weightlessness on the human organism.
This research was carried out both on board the Mir station and in the Spacelab laboratory on board Atlantis.
Using propulsion units belonging to the Mir and the Atlantis, experiments were performed to determine the dynamic properties of the large-scale system.
On 4 July 1995, after the international crew had completed its joint research in orbit, the Atlantis reusable spacecraft separated from the Mir orbital station.
Together with the American astronauts Robert Gibson, Charles Precourt, Ellen Baker, Gregory Harbaugh, Bonnie Dunbar and Norman Thagard, there were two Russian cosmonauts, V. Dezhurov and G. Strekalov, who returned to the Earth on board the Atlantis on 7 July 1995.
Fifteen minutes before the Atlantis separated from the Mir orbital station, the Soyuz-TM transport craft undocked from the station carrying on board the crew of the 19th principal expedition, A. Solovyov and N. Budarin, and made a flight around the station.
The purpose of this operation was to enable the cosmonauts to take photographs and make video recordings of the docking of the Russian and American spacecraft.
The Soyuz-TM craft flew independently for a total of 43 minutes, after which it once again docked with the Mir research station.
Over a period of 75 days the crew of the 19th principal expedition completed its scheduled assignments in the areas of geophysics, astrophysics, space materials science, medicine and biology, including a cycle of experiments under the Mir-Shuttle programme; they also made three open-space walks with a total duration of 13 hours, 46 minutes.
During the first space walk the cosmonauts carried out checks of the external components of the Mir station and assessed the condition of the side docking unit.
Using a specially designed instrument, they opened the supplementary solar-cell array on the Spektr module.
During the second walk in open space a Trek instrument panel was removed from the external wall of the Kvant-2 module, this panel having been used over a period of four years in joint Russian-American experiments to study the generation and distribution in the galaxy of superheavy cosmic ray nuclei.
Also taken from the outside surface of the module were cassettes containing samples of structural materials which had been exposed for long periods of time to open-space conditions; these were replaced with new ones.
During the third walk the cosmonauts mounted a Miras large-scale spectrometer, with a mass of some 200 kg, on the external surface of the Mir station.
The spectrometer, designed by Belgian and Russian specialists, is intended for geophysical research. It was delivered to the manned station by the Spektr module.
During this last week the crew of the 19th principal expedition has been collaborating with the international crew (cosmonauts Y. Gidzenko and S. Avdeev and an astronaut from the European Space Agency (ESA), Thomas Reiter).
Their programme, scheduled to last 135 days, covers a wide range of experiments and research, using the various equipment installed in the Mir station as well as work in open space.
On 20 October 1995, cosmonaut S. Avdeev and astronaut T. Reiter made a walk in open space lasting 5 hours, 16 minutes.
Its purpose was to mount scientific instruments on the external surface of the Spektr research module in preparation for experiments to be performed in connection with the EUROMIR-95 project.
Under an agreement concluded in October 1995 between the RSA and the ESA, T. Reiter's flight on board the Mir station was extended by 44 days to a total of 179 days.
This will set a new half-year record for the length of time spent in space by a Western astronaut.
The Spektr module, with a mass of some 20 tons, was launched on 20 May 1995 and docked with the Mir station on 1 June 1995 for the purpose of enabling scientific and technical research and experiments to be performed on the Mir orbital station, partly within the framework of the multi-year manned flight cooperation programme, and also in order to supply the manned station with additional solar-cell arrays and equipment.
The scientific equipment comprises Russian, American and European makes.
It is intended for biomedical research, study of the Earth's natural resources and its environment and of physical processes in the upper atmosphere and circumterrestrial space, and also experiments in the fields of applied science.
The total mass of the Mir-Kvant-Kvant-2-Kristall-Spektr-Soyuz TM-21 complex was over 120 tons.
The work operation of the Mir orbital station in 1995 was permitted by four unmanned cargo spacecraft from the Progress M series (Progress M-26 to Progress M-29), which docked with it on 17 February, 12 April, 22 July and 10 October respectively.
In addition, under the flight programme, operations were performed during the period from 27 May to 10 June and also on 17 July 1995 to redock the Kristall and Spektr modules.
All the operations involving the undocking of spacecraft from the Mir station, their shifting and emplacement at their standard working locations were performed by automatic flight control using manipulators present on the modules.
B. Applied space technology programmes
In 1995 the operation of the long-range telephone and telegraph communication system was maintained, as was the relaying of radio and television programmes and the transmission of data on behalf of various sectors and official authorities of the Russian Federation and international communications by means of the Gorizont, Ekspress, Gals and Ekran-N spacecraft.
In order to ensure operation of the long-range telephone and telegraph communication system and transmission of television programmes to points on the Orbita network, in the interests of international cooperation and also for other economic purposes, satellites from the Molniya-3, Cosmos-2319, Luch-1 and Gals series were orbited on 9 August, 30 August, 11 October and 17 November 1995 respectively.
To ensure operation of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) used for navigation by civil aircraft, and naval and fishing vessels, as well as in other areas of the economy, six artificial satellites from the Cosmos series were launched on 7 March and 24 July 1995.
A total of 22 space facilities from the Cosmos series are now in orbit as part of the GLONASS system. In the course of 1995, their number was increased to the standard quota of 24 satellites.
24 January 1995 saw the launch of an artificial Earth satellite from the Tsikada series.
This satellite will operate as part of the space navigation system of the same name, the purpose of which is to track naval and fishing vessels throughout the Pacific Ocean.
The Nadezhda satellite continued operating within the COSPAS-SARSAT international system for tracking and rescuing sea vessels and aircraft in distress.
For the purposes of observing the Earth's surface within the Russian and Ukrainian national and international programmes, including environmental monitoring of the natural environment, and in order to obtain up-to-date information on the state of the icecap in the Arctic region and the condition of shelf areas of the Pacific Ocean, a Sich-1 satellite (Ukraine) was launched on 31 August 1995.
As part of continued research in the area of space materials science, a regular artificial Earth satellite from the Foton series was launched on 16 February 1995.
Over a 15-day period experiments were performed on board the satellite to obtain, under microgravity conditions, semiconductor materials with improved properties and optical glass with a variable reflective index, and to carry out biological research.
In addition, the "Biobox" equipment designed by ESA specialists and the IBIS equipment developed by specialists from the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) were tested.
With a view to continuing research on the Earth's natural resources for the benefit of various sectors of the economy and for the purposes of environmental monitoring and international cooperation, a satellite from the Resurs-F series was launched into orbit on 26 September 1995, its particular purpose being to take multizonal and spectrozonal photographs of various scales.
In 1995 the satellites Meteor-3, Resurs-01, Okean-01 and Electro continued to operate for the benefit of hydrometeorology, oceanography and investigation of the Earth's natural resources.
C. Space research programmes
The programme of flight experiments at the Granate orbital observatory was continued successfully.
Over the six years of its operation a detailed study has been made of several dozen galactic and extragalactic sources presumed to be black holes, neutron stars (X-ray bursters and X-ray pulsars), X-ray novae, and accumulations of galaxies and quasars; several extremely interesting and hitherto unknown objects have been discovered.
New sources emitting radiation in the annihilation gamma line of positrons have also been discovered.
At the present time, following the observation in September 1995 of the galactic centre, the observatory is operating in scanning mode.
An extensive programme of scientific, technical, technological and other research and experimentation was conducted in the course of manned flights by Russian cosmonauts on board the Mir station.
The Roentgen international observatory has been operating successfully in orbit for eight years as part of the Mir station.
A series of observations and photographs of the central part of the galaxy was taken using its telescopes in 1995.
In order to study physical processes in the Universe, measurements were performed to determine cosmic ray spectra in various wavelengths and bandwidths.
Using the Maria magnetic spectrometer and the "Buket" telescope-spectrometer, experiments were performed to measure sources of high-energy charged particles in circumterrestrial space, including the Earth's radiation belts, and to register galactic and extragalactic sources of X-ray radiation.
As part of the programme for exploring the Earth's natural resources and studying the environment, including environmental monitoring visual observations, photography and spectrometric measurements were made of the land and water areas of the Pacific Ocean, partly by means of the Priroda-5 instruments installed on the Spektr module.
Further experiments were performed to assess the effects of the space environment on structural materials and radio-electronic components exposed for long periods under open-space conditions.
A set of experiments was performed at various technical facilities in the field of space materials science.
In particular, fusing was carried out at the Gallar facility to obtain a semiconductor material with improved properties.
At the ALISSA facility an experiment was conducted to obtain information on particular aspects of thermal mass transfer in gas-liquid systems under microgravity conditions.
With a view to further investigation of radiation conditions in orbit and to improving the resources available for space dosimetry, the micrometeorite situation along the flight track of the Mir station was monitored and the Spin-6000 experiment measuring gamma-ray spectra in various parts of the orbital station was performed.
A series of scientific space studies prepared jointly by Russian and American specialists was carried out under the Mir-Shuttle programme.
Experiments were conducted to investigate how the human organism adjusts to weightlessness, to determine radiation conditions in orbit and to measure the spectra of ionising cosmic radiation.
This work was chiefly aimed at obtaining basic scientific data in various areas of space medicine and biology.
In the interests of medical control and in order to obtain additional information on the condition of the human organism at various stages of space flight, the cosmonauts underwent cardiovascular examinations involving simulation of the Earth's gravity in a Chibis pneumatic vacuum costume and physical exercises on a veloergometer.
Biological experiments were performed to study the growth of higher plants under conditions of weightlessness, together with the so-called "Incubator" experiment aimed at investigating the influence of weightlessness and other aspects of cosmic flight on the development of bird embryos.
A series of "Resonance" technical experiments was carried out in order to determine the parameters of the acoustic and electromagnetic effects of the instruments and apparatus installed in various sections of the manned station, along with experiments on the Volna facility designed to investigate the performance of the capillary suction units of the fuel tanks of future spacecraft.
D. International cooperation
A solar research programme is being continued under the international Coronas-I project (research on dynamic, active solar processes, the properties of solar cosmic radiation and electromagnetic radiation in the radio, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma bands).
Work is being continued in connection with the international APEX project started with the launch in 1991 of the Intercosmos-25 satellite and the Magion-3 subsatellite, the aim of the project being to study the effects of artificially generated modulated electron streams and plasma beams on the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.
On 3 August 1995, within the framework of the Interbol project, the Prognoz-M2 unmanned station was launched for the purpose of long-term basic research on processes in the geomagnetic tail of the Earth's magnetosphere.
This research forms an integral part of the international programme for investigating the nature and mechanisms of Sun-Earth interaction by means of space facilities and Earth-based observatories in various countries.
The station has been fitted with scientific instruments designed by scientists and specialists from Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Uzbekistan, and also by member countries of the ESA.
The Magion-4 subsatellite, manufactured in the Czech Republic, was launched into orbit at the same time to permit research, in coordination with the main satellite, of the properties of circumterrestrial plasma and the magnetic field.
Under the Agreement of 17 June 1992 between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and the Executive Agreement of 5 October 1992 between the RSA and NASA on collaboration in manned flights, the Russian cosmonaut V. Titov took part in a programme of scientific research and experiments on board the American space shuttle Discovery, while the American astronaut Norman Thagard participated in a programme of scientific and technical research and experimentation on board the Mir station.
In the course of an eight-day expedition (3-11 February 1995), an international crew composed of the American astronauts J. Wetherbee, E. Collins, M. Foale, B. Harris and J. Voss-Ford and the Russian cosmonaut V. Titov completed an important phase of the joint Russian-American manned space flight programme, namely the approach of the orbital craft to the Mir research station and the flight around it.
Scientific and technical and biomedical research and experiments were conducted during this expedition.
Under a commercial agreement, the German citizen and ESA astronaut T. Reiter is conducting a programme lasting several months and consisting of medical, technological and technical experiments devised by ESA specialists.
These experiments are being performed on board the Mir station within the framework of the EUROMIR-95 project.
On 24 January, the Cosmos carrier rocket was used to launch the Tsikada spacecraft together with the American experimental communication satellite FAISAT and the Swedish scientific satellite Astrid, designed for plasma research in circumterrestrial space.
The satellites were separated from Tsikada on its seventh revolution around the Earth.
On 19 April 1995, the crew of the 18th principal expedition succeeded in launching the German microsatellite GFZ-1 through the air-lock of the Mir station's core unit.
This microsatellite is intended for research of the Earth's gravitational field.
In August 1995, the Second International Air-Space Salon (MAKS-95) was held in the Russian Federation, attracting the participation of around 400 organizations from that country and over 100 foreign firms and companies from 23 countries. SLOVENIA
At present, Slovenia reports that it does not have a national space programme.

1. Introduction
Lebanon is a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
Space-related activities started in the country in the 1960's with the installation of a terrestrial station for telephone communication through satellite.
Unfortunately the war has not only stopped development in this field, but also crippled most endeavours along this line, one of the most notably affected being the acquisition of basic information.
With the recovery of peace in the early 1990's, some activities were resumed and efforts are being spent to reach new developments.
At present, the application of space-related technology in Lebanon is restricted to the use of satellite capabilities in the following areas:
(a) Space telecommunications
(b) T.V. broadcasting
(c) Meteorological information
(d) Earth observations - remote sensing.
The Ministry of Post and Telecommunication (PT) is the national authority supervising and facilitating telecommunication channels through satellites.
It has provided all means needed by public and private sectors for establishing up-link and down-link connections.
These links are being used for telephone, television and related purposes in analogue transmissions via four terrestrial stations based in different localities to cover the whole country.
There is one public and many private broadcasting stations.
They have their own means for down-link connection only, but may use the facilities available at the PT Ministry for up-link connections.
Recently the government is attempting to have a more controlled system by working on upgrading the legislation and technical regulations for that purpose.
The satellites being used for telecommunications and television broadcasting are: ARABSAT, ASTRA, EUTELSAT, HOT BIRD, Inmarsat, INTELSAT, INTERSPUTNIK and TELECOM.
In the near future, it is planned to have one terrestrial station for numerical transmission through INTELSAT.
Lebanon is a shareholder in the Intermediate Circular Orbit (ICO) project for mobile service by Inmarsat satellites.
The starting date for this application is expected to be June 1999.
By that time there will be enough communication channels for telephone and television broadcasting to meet all the needs of communications and local television stations.
There is a meteorological station at Beirut international airport which receives information from meteorological satellites (geostationary and others) such as: METEOSAT, NOAA and EUTELSAT.
(d) Earth observations and remote sensing
The Lebanese National Council for Scientific Research decided in early 1995 to establish the National Center for Remote Sensing.
(i) Aims of the Center
The aims of the Center include the following:
(a) Formulating and implementing scientific and planning programs needing remote sensing technology.
(b) Cooperating with and assisting the public and private sector organizations, institutes, etc. in planning and implementing the use of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) in their operations, with emphasis on environmental concerns.
(c) Securing databases from satellite imagery on a timely basis in different areas and disciplines and making the information available, as needs arise, to the public and private sector.
(d) Interacting and cooperating with remote sensing centers, both regional and international, for purposes of scientific progress and in the public interest, ensuring information on environmental issues.
(e) Establishing the needed in-house and field support systems and laboratories for ground "truths" and confirmation of remotely sensed data.
(f) Training and capacity building of personnel for the Center as it grows and for other purposes as needs arise.
(g) Formulating and advising on actions and policies related to conventions, protocols, agreements, or otherwise related to remote sensing with regional and international counterparts or governments.
(ii) Projects launched
In cooperation with the Syrian General Organization of Remote Sensing (GORS), the following projects are being pursued:
(a) Agriculture: Formulating the unified pedological map for Lebanon at a scale of 1:50,000.
(b) Hydrogeology: Studying the fresh water sources along the Lebanese marine-beach stretch.
(c) Geology: Studying iron ore deposits that lie along the border between Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Another potential project involves producing an accurate map of the tectonic regime of the great Syrian rift along the eastern Mediterranean in Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.
(d) Archaeology: Through financial help from UNESCO, a team is looking into untouched archaeological sites of interest in cooperation with Italy's Torino CST institute.
(iii) Aid needed
Our Center's needs are summarized as follows:

1. Activities undertaken in 1995 in the area of the peaceful uses of outer space
The space activities carried out in 1995 by Morocco are characterised by an active, realistic and long-term policy at both the national level (coordination, information, training and project formulation) and the international level (participation in forums, international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects).
The use of outer space is becoming ever more developed, extensive and diversified.
(a) Space telecommunications and data
Morocco currently operates three satellite stations providing national and international circuits (the Mohammed V station at Rabat, a station at Laayoune and another one at Dakhla).
It is a partner in the operation of the ARABSAT system and has signed a cooperation agreement with EUTELSAT and INTELSAT for the direct transmission of national television and radio programmes in Europe, Canada, the United States of America and certain Scandinavian countries.
These networks are managed by the government department with competence for them, namely the Ministry for Post and Telecommunications.
In addition, the National Office for Post and Telecommunications, which comes under this Ministry, carried out an extensive modernization programme in 1995 in order to digitize and extend the entire equipment of Earth stations.
With regard to satellite data, stations are currently in operation to receive METEOSAT weather satellite data, for example at the National Department of Meteorology (DMN).
There are plans to set up two NOAA stations, one for meteorological studies at the DMN and the other at the Royal Centre for Spaceborne Remote Sensing (CRTS) for receiving advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data.
This station is to be set up within the framework of the GLOVE project, which is co-financed by the European Union.
The distribution of satellite images in the Kingdom is the responsibility of CRTS.
In order to accomplish this task, the Centre has concluded contacts with a number of satellite image distributors: Spot Image in France for Spot data, Eurimage in Italy for LANDSAT, NOAA, ERS and IRS data, etc.
CRTS is also responsible for centralizing the national archives of satellite data and data from projects using spaceborne remote sensing.
2. Applications and projects
(a) Radiolocation
A programme for locating and tracking ships at sea by satellite is currently being set up by the Ministry for Maritime Fisheries and the Merchant Navy.
It involves two systems:
- A position-finding system;
- A transmission system.
The aim of this programme is to locate and track fishing boats in the Moroccan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by establishing four centres equipped to provide automatic position-finding, to exchange and transmit data and to establish the associated database.
The position-finding and transmission functions will be performed by satellite.
(b) Data exchange and information networks
CRTS is coordinating Moroccan efforts to set up the Cooperation Information Network (COPINE) project launched by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.
This project aims to establish satellite communication stations (INTELSAT) in a number of African countries enabling them to exchange data with each other and with European countries, particularly in the areas of the environment, natural resources and telemedicine.
The opening up of rural areas is a facet of the project of particular interest to national users.
(c) Remote sensing
A number of projects combining spaceborne remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are in the process of development or implementation.
These projects are designed to meet needs in the areas of natural resource stocktaking and management, environmental protection and town and country planning within the context of national and regional development programmes.
- With regard to natural resources and the environment, several significant projects might be mentioned:
(a) The national AGRIMA project (co-financed by UNDP, the Ministry for Agriculture and CRTS) on the incorporation of satellite data in the country's agricultural statistics;
(b) The FORMA project (at the development stage and co-financed by the European Union, the Ministry for Agriculture and CRTS) on satellite surveillance of Moroccan forests;
(c) A study of the changes in land use and the estimation of the biomasses involved (financed by UNEP/GEF and managed by the Ministry for the Environment);
(d) The GEOSTAT project on vegetation mapping and the survey of common grazing land in Morocco, with the collaboration of CRTS, the Ministry for Agriculture and the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES).
CRTS and CNES are currently working with the Sahara and Sahel Observatory to consider the possibility of extending this study to the region.
- With regard to the coastline and marine environment monitoring:
(a) Morocco is currently working on applications for lagoon management and beach mapping;
(b) The national GERMA project (co-financed by the European Union, the Ministry for Maritime Fisheries and the Merchant Navy and CRTS), for the development of a system based on satellite images for marine resource management, is in the implementation phase;
(c) Morocco has participated in the airborne GLOBESAR campaign initiated by Canada to prepare for the launching of that country's RADARSAT satellite and, in that connection, has embarked on coastline and soil erosion research.
- In the area of town planning, CRTS, together with the Rabat Urban Agency and Belgian Cooperation, is setting up a project using satellite data to monitor cities in developing countries.
The aim of this project is to take advantage of existing methodologies and adapt them to towns with high growth rates.
3. Information and training in space techniques
(a) Remote sensing
Seminars, exhibitions and information events have been organized on a regular basis in order to make decision makers, officials and scientists aware of the existing and potential applications of remote sensing.
In the area of ongoing training, CRTS has continued organizing short (one-week) and longer (two-week) courses to provide an introduction into the basic principles of spaceborne remote sensing, geographic information systems, and applications in areas of particular interest to the Kingdom and the region.
These courses, especially those relating to water resources, desertification, common grazing land and the management of fishery resources, are regularly attended by African participants in positions of responsibility.
By way of supplementing these training programmes, CRTS organized several training events in 1995 at the request of users.
At the request of FAO, for instance, a regional training event, geared to the four Atlantic coast countries (Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and Senegal) comprising the test area for the "Regional Marine Database-BDRM" convention, was held on the use of GIS.
(b) Space technology
Morocco has been chosen as host country for the Regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education located at the Mohammadia Engineering School (EMI).
Studies have already been initiated to establish training programmes and means of financing.
4. Regional and international activities
Morocco has continued to intensify its involvement in regional and international space-related activities by:
- Taking an active part in meetings organized by regional and international organizations for the purpose of identifying the needs of developing countries and proposing ways and means of encouraging the use of space technology in Africa;
- Organizing international events to promote scientific exchange and North-South and South-South cooperation, particularly in the area of spaceborne remote sensing and its use in the management of natural resources, environmental protection and the formulation of strategies for sustainable development;
- Providing expert assistance in setting up programmes and projects concerning the region.
Morocco, for instance, was selected in 1995 to assist in mounting the FAO project AFRICOVER on the African continent.
In addition, together with the Scientific Institute of Fisheries and the National Meteorological Directorate, CRTS organized in collaboration with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), FAO, WMO and the European Union an international workshop on the subject: "Space oceanography: climate and marine resources in North-West Africa". Eleven countries, five of them from Africa, took part in this event, which provided an opportunity to review the current situation in this field.
The workshop also took the first steps towards establishing a regional programme on aspects of climatology and oceanography on the basis of satellite images under the direction of IOC, FAO and CRTS.
As a follow-up to MARISY 92, MARISY 95, on spaceborne remote sensing for the environment and development in the spirit of the recommendations of Agenda 21, has been organized by Morocco in collaboration with space agencies and regional and international organizations.UNDP, ECA, FAO, the European Union, MEDIA-IGBP, the African Organization for Cartography and Remote Sensing, EURISY, the European Space Agency and a number of national space agencies: ASI (Italy), CNES (France), INTA (Spain) and SSTC (Belgium).
MARISY 95 has brought together decision makers, users and specialists from 37 industrialized and developing countries, including 25 African nations and countries of the Middle Eastern region.
In its work, this forum has focused on applications of spaceborne remote sensing in areas of high priority for developing countries: oceanography and fisheries, agricultural and forestry, water resources and geology, town planning, cartography and land development.
A special session was devoted to training, access to data and cost-benefit ratios.
During this forum an international jury awarded the MARISY 95 prize of 100,000 US dollars to Benin, Senegal and Tunisia for the three best projects from the region.
The forum's conclusions took the form of a declaration that it adopted on spaceborne remote sensing for the environment and development, which is devoted particularly to developing countries.

[Original: English]
With regard to the importance of the space debris problem for all spacefaring nations, Germany was highly satisfied with promoting "Space Debris" to the status of priority agenda item in the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of UNCOPUOS.
In order to focus the considerations of this agenda item, Germany was constructively involved in designing the work plan (1996 to 1998) adopted at the thirty-second session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Germany gives high priority to contributing significantly to the deliberations under this agenda item and to the mentioned work plan.
For this purpose, Germany has regularly contributed reports on national space debris research for UNCOPUOS.
The last report has been issued as UN Doc. A/AC.105/593/Add.1 of 24 January 1995. It contained a description of space debris research activities together with an elaboration of the space debris strategy of the German Space Agency DARA.
German research activities are either conducted on a national footing or are funded under contracts with the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) and the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) of the European Space Agency (ESA).
The research activities are largely concentrated in (a) the Institute for Space Flight Technology and Nuclear Reactor Technology of the Technical University of Braunschweig (IfRR/TUBS) and (b) the Research Establishment for Applied Science of Wachtberg-Werthhoven (FGAN).
These two institutions have continued their work with the following main results:
‚óè IfRR/TUBS has continued its activities in the field of modelling and model validation.
The work on the ESA MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) Space Debris Model has been finalized.Final Report of ESOC-Contract 10453/93/D/CS, ESA/ESOC(MAS), 1994.
A number of CD ROMs containing the model data and the application software has been delivered to ESA/ESOC for the purpose of reviewing and testing.
The public distribution of ESA MASTER is scheduled for early 1996.
‚óè Space debris related studies at FGAN are aiming primarily at the investigation and development of radar techniques and analysis methods to detect, classify and identify space objects in low Earth orbits (LEO), geostationary orbits (GSO), and geostationary transfer orbits (GTO).Magura, K. and Mehrholz, D.: ‚ÄûMeasurement and analysis techniques for satellite observations used at FGAN-FHP‚Äú.
Radar data of selected space objects are gained in the tracking mode of operation using the Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA).
From these data the physical properties are derived like size, shape, dimensions, intrinsic motion, mass, orbit, and orbital lifetime.
Radar observations of defined space volumes in the beam-park mode of operation are providing data on the population density.
For model validation this information can be compared with results from space debris environmental models.
The activities are funded mainly by DARA and ESA/ESOC.
A detailed report on the activities of these two institutions is given in sections A and B below.
I. Space debris modelling and prevention (IfRR/TUBS)
A. Space debris modelling
The work on the ESA MASTER Space Debris Model has been finished at IfRR.
A number of CD ROMs containing the model data and the application software has been delivered to ESA/ESOC for the purpose of reviewing and testing.
The public distribution of ESA MASTER is scheduled early 1996.
B. Future increase of orbital debris and prevention of additional debris generationBendisch, I. and Rex, D. ‚ÄûThe long-term evolution of orbital debris - new findings concerning collisional cascading‚Äú, 46th IAF Congress, Oslo, Norway, October 1995 (paper-no. IAA.-95-IAA.6.4.08).
The role of space debris modelling has changed and been extended significantly within the last years.
It started as a tool for the purpose of describing the current status of orbital debris, but more and more it gains importance concerning the analysis of future scenarios and in relation with debris mitigation measures.
It is worth noting at this stage that the analysis of future scenarios is affected by a number of influences beyond the purely mathematical description of the problem, e.g.
‚óè the actual future launch rate
‚óè statistical deviations esp. for initially low collision probabilities.
Hence, the absolute outcome of the model for a certain scenario is always subject to uncertainties, however one can use the analysis of future scenarios e.g. in order to compare the effectiveness of debris mitigation measures relative to one another and to evaluate certain trends.
At IfRR/TUBS a study funded by the German Space Agency DARA has been finalized, which has analyzed a number of future scenarios under the above-mentioned conditions considering objects > 1 cm in diameter up to an orbital altitude of 2000 km.
A special statistical long term model is used for this purpose.
A number of modifications have been introduced to improve the long term models used so far.
First of all the initial population > 1 cm has been taken from the ESA MASTER Model (Epoch = 1995.0), which is an up-to-date analysis tool.
This leads to a reduced number of initial objects > 1 cm compared to the previously used population.
This is due to more realistic simulation of the historical break-ups in MASTER.
But not only the initial number of objects was reduced.
Also the total mass in orbit was assumed to be smaller due to somewhat more realistic and conservative assumptions concerning the masses of spent satellites and rocket bodies.
These are catalogued objects, which are not subject to any kind of simulation, but taken from deterministic sources.
The new initial population rather underestimates the effects of interactive collisions than suggesting an unrealistic threat, so it produces a conservative scenario for the future.
A number of debris mitigation scenarios has been analyzed, in detail there are:
‚óè no overall debris mitigation measures
‚óè reducing the orbital lifetime of spent s/c
as follows: 100% from 2000
as follows: 30% from 2005, 50% from 2015,
100% from 2020
* One explosion per year assumed due to the number of rocket bodies still in orbit
For the simulation shown in Fig. 1 post-operational orbital lifetimes of 25 years were assumed to be permitted.
It can be seen from Fig. 1 that debris mitigation according to the realistic scenarios A to C is able to reduce population to less than 50% compared to the 'Business as Usual' case.
On the other hand this would represent a growth by a factor of four within the next 100 years related to the current population.
Fig. 2 gives a population breakdown for the 100 years 'Business as Usual'.
It can be seen that explosions contribute substantially to the growing population.
But the fragments from background collisions, i.e. collisions among the basic population including explosion fragments, gain importance with time.
After about 70 years they are dominating the population.
Feedback collisions, i.e. collisions where one or both objects are fragments generated by previous collisions, will not play any significant role within the next 100 years, according to this conservative model.
It might be argued that the prevention of explosions in space can be applied to avoid a significant growth of the population > 1 cm with time.
The additional explosion fragments disappear, but the collision rate is not effected by this measure.
There are as many fragments generated by collisions as shown in Fig. 2 for the scenario including explosions.
This is due to the fact, that the larger objects will be responsible for the generation of most of the collision fragments in the future.
‚óè It could be shown that within the next 100 years collision fragments will dominate the population > 1 cm.
Collisional cascading will not set in during 100 years, since most of the destructive collisions will occur between the members of the background population and not between collision fragments.
‚óè The current population assumed is less sensitive concerning interactive collision than stated in former analysis.
Nevertheless, the necessity of debris mitigation is proven.
Only by a sophisticated debris management the future spaceflight activities can be continued without any unacceptable collision risks, esp. in the 800 km to 1100 km altitude regime.
‚óè Besides explosion prevention, the reduction of the orbital lifetimes of spent satellites and rocket bodies to about 25 years is a necessary and appropriate debris mitigation measure.
It can be reached by propulsive lowering of the perigees of orbits or by propulsive de-orbiting.
‚óè Within the next 100 years the population > 1 cm will grow by a factor of 3 to 4, even if the above mentioned mitigation measures will be performed consequently.
B. Radar detection and measurement of orbital debris (FGAN)
The FGAN Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA) is primarily used to investigate methods and techniques for classification and identification of aircraft and satellites.
To a certain extend TIRA is additionally used to gain radar data of orbital debris.
For that mainly two modes of operation have been developed: a tracking mode of operation to measure selected objects in LEO, GSO and GTO and a beam-park mode of operation to collect data on the population of space objects in defined space volumes.
TIRA consists of a narrowband tracking radar and a high resolution imaging radar.
Both radars are supported from a 34-m parabolic antenna.
Methods and algorithms have been developed to analyse narrowband radar signatures, to compute radar images from high resolution radar data, and to estimate physical properties of space objects like size, shape, dimensions, intrinsic motion, mass, orbit, and orbital lifetime.
These methods and techniques need further improvement and refinement to cope with mid-size space debris (size 1-50 cm).
1. Radar detection of mid-size space debris
The main objective of an ESA-Study (ESA/ESOC Contract, 2/93 - 12/94) focussed on the investigation of cost-effective modifications to the L-band tracking radar of the TIRA system to detect and track space debris larger than 1 cm in LEO for the improvement and verification of space debris environmental models.
Several approaches to search for small targets at high ranges in defined space volumes were analysed.
Based on the findings concepts for hardware modifications together with requirements for improved radar observation and data processing techniques were developed.
AIUB, Zimmerwald, Switzerland.
The purpose of the campaign was to detect in a specific volume near 800 km altitude all objects of a minimum size, and to compare the detections with those predicted by a space debris model.
The minimum size of detectable objects with the FGAN TIRA system at that altitude was about 3 cm.
A preliminary analysis indicated a significant larger number of detections compared to the predictions from the ESA MASTER model (for the Haystack radar (USA) the MASTER model underpredicts slightly the number of detections).
The analysis of the several hundred Gigabytes of data is still ongoing at FGAN.
2. Determination of physical characteristics of space debris
The objective of a NASA/FGAN joint research investigation (DARA Contract, 1/90-6/95) was to characterize and compare debris shape, size intrinsic motion, mass, and orbital lifetime from different types of satellite breakups, for example, from collision and from explosions.
The FGAN TIRA system was employed to measure a number of 30 debris objects (sizes larger than 50 cm) selected by NASA, of six small metal spheres of the NASA experiment ODERACS-I (orbital debris calibration spheres, diameter of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm), as well as of three small metal spheres (diameter of 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm) and dipoles (two wires of 13.1 cm length and 0.1 cm diameter) of the ODERACS-II experiment.
A total of 44 objects (including radar calibration satellites) were frequently measured and analysed resulting in estimates of size, shape, intrinsic motion, mass, orbit, and orbital lifetime.
The results are useful for modelling drag effects of the high atmosphere, for validation of fragmentation events, for concept development of space based detection and warning methods, and for considerations of active removal techniques.
3. Advanced radar techniques for space debris observation
The purpose of an ESA-Study (ESA/ESOC Contract, 2/95-3/98) is to enhance the detection performance of the existing FGAN TIRA system to detect and track mid-size space debris in LEO (size 1-50 cm) in order to validate and improve the current environmental models.
Within this study all necessary hardware-upgrades and developments of special observation techniques as well as signal and data processing algorithms will be carried out.
It is hoped that space debris of 2 cm size will be detected in 1000 km range.
Activities were started to investigate, how this detection performance can be further improved with bistatic radar experiments.
Radar measurements of ARIANE upper stages in GTO will help to understand the generation of space debris due to fragmentation in these orbits.
Estimates of mass and ballistic coefficient could help to answer the question what the reasons are for the debris creation processes.
Radar measurements of debris objects of 1 m size and larger in GEO have been carried out with the FGAN TIRA system to investigate size, intrinsic motion, and the accuracy with which the orbit of these objects can be computed.
The activities were performed in cooperation with the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB), Switzerland.
4. Reentry predictions of high risk space objects
The objective of this activity is to provide the Federal Minister of Interior during reentry of high risk space objects with reliable predictions of reentry windows (time and ground track), estimations of object‚Äôs attitude, and risk assessments.
Within cooperation agreements FGAN provides ESA/ESOC tracking radar data of high risk space objects to support European reentry predictions.
C. Other research activities
Although the decision on an European contribution to the International Space Station has been made, activities in the field of shielding and impact analysis of the station construction elements have not yet been resumed in Germany.
Beside some industry-funded investigations, related to debris impact protection measures of pressure vessels and to the shielding effectiveness of composite materials, few ESA/ESTEC funded studies are under execution: the Ernst-Mach-Institute (EMI) investigates the phenomena of hypervelocity impacts on CMCs (Ceramic Matrix Composites) and on flexible thermal insulations.
Furthermore the study from the preceding year at EMI related to the investigations of the conditions of catastrophic failure of pressurized vessels under debris impacts is still running.
The ESA-study "Shaped charges for hypervelocity impact testing‚Äú at the Battelle Research Institute is also still running.
Just at the end of 1995 few hypervelocity impact shots with the shape charge facility of TDW (Gesellschaft f√ºr verteidigungstechnische Wirksysteme mbH) have been performed, funded by DARA, to investigate the suitability for debris impact simulation and phenomena at velocities higher than 15 km/sec.
The evaluation of these tests has not yet been closed.

Annex.
A. Background and objectives
. The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, decided, upon the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82),1 that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, inter alia, should organize meetings on advanced space applications and new system developments for managers and decision makers in the area of space application and technology development activities and for users of such technology and should promote greater cooperation in space science and technology between developed and developing countries as well as among developing countries.
. In response to General Assembly resolution 49/34, and in accordance with the recommendations of UNISPACE 82, a United Nations/European Space Agency Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development and Communications was organized, within the framework of the activities of the Programme for 1995, for the benefit of countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
. The Conference was organized jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Instituto Mexicano de Comunicaciones and the Instituto de Geograf√≠a, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico.
. The objectives of the Conference were: (a) to examine how space technology could support the planning and executing of sustainable development programmes or projects; (b) to discuss the existence, or need for the establishment, and utilization of global and regional environmental information systems; and (c) to examine the role of satellite communications in the generation and delivery of information and services, including those needed for rural communications, education and health care, as well as for the prevention and mitigation of the effects of natural disasters.
B. Organization and programme of the Conference
. The Conference was held from 30 October to 3 November 1995 at Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The Conference was scheduled to take place the week before the VII Latin American Remote Sensing Association (SELPER) Symposium, held at Puerto Vallarta from 5 to 10 November 1995.
This coordination enabled some participants from Latin America and the Caribbean, whose travel was provided by the co-sponsors of the Conference, to participate in the SELPER Symposium at minimal expense to their institutions. . The Conference was attended by 66 participants.
Participants came from the following countries: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.
The following organizations and institutions were represented: International Telecommunication Union, ESA, Inter-American Development Bank, International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), Agencia Espacial Brasileira, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America, Nuova Telespazio of Italy and RADARSAT International of Canada.
Financial support to defray the cost of air travel and living expenses of 31 participants was provided by the United Nations, ESA and the Instituto Mexicano de Comunicaciones.
The expenses for speakers and other participants were defrayed by their own institutions.
The programme of the Conference (see the annex to the present report) was developed jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, ESA, the Instituto Mexicano de Comunicaciones and the Instituto de Geograf√≠a, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico.
Through technical presentations and working group discussions, the participants received the most recent information on the vital role that Earth observation and communication satellites could play in the timely collection and dissemination of data and information, providing valuable, sometimes crucial, input for planning and executing operationally viable strategies for sustainable development such as those contained in Agenda 21.3
This capability is being utilized in improving telephone communications, as well as in transmitting entertainment, health and educational programmes, particularly to rural areas.
New areas of communications technology include the mobile communications and global positioning systems, both of which will have a strong impact on national economies.
Communication satellites, particularly in combination with data from Earth observation satellites, will increasingly be used in establishing systems for preventing or mitigating the effects of natural disasters.
. The present report, which covers the background, objectives and organization of the Conference, in addition to presenting the observations and recommendations of the Conference and a summary of the technical presentations, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
The participants in the Conference reported on the knowledge that they acquired and on the work conducted during the Conference to the appropriate authorities of the Government, universities and research institutions in their respective countries.
I. BACKGROUND ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The world, however, is confronted with increasing hunger, poverty, illiteracy, ill health, natural resource depletion and destructive human activity, which tend to dispel the applicability of this maxim.
. The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities, such as food, shelter, a clean and healthy environment and proper education, to the growing population of Earth.
Of the more than 5 billion people who currently inhabit the Earth, 1 billion, mostly in developing countries, do not have access to clean drinking-water and over 1.7 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation.
Moreover, it is estimated that in the next 25-40 years, the population of the Earth will surpass 9 billion.
. Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale, continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth's natural environment.
A good knowledge of the Earth environment is needed to develop national and international policies that can solve environmental problems and to properly manage limited natural resources.
. Natural disasters have direct economic costs amounting to billions of United States dollars per year.
Besides the loss of human lives and suffering, these events disrupt the normal flow of economies and require enormous amounts of financial resources that could otherwise have been channelled into development.
Usually the developing countries are least prepared to minimize and repair the damages and to provide the necessary emergency relief.
. Countries faced with these economic and social problems must not only formulate plans of action that promote important production objectives and improve existing human conditions, but must also attempt to provide contingency plans for future growth and further stress on already deficient infrastructure.
. A process of re-examining and redefining development is taking place at the United Nations.
Through a cycle of world conferences, consensus is being built around essential development values.
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992, the links between the environment and development were established.
The World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, reaffirmed the right to development as a basic human right.
The International Conference on Population and Development, held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994, indicated that population growth could be an asset or an obstacle to development, depending on whether it was left unchecked.
The World Summit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen from 6 to 12 March 1995, addressed poverty and unemployment, while the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace, held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995, addressed the integration of women into development and women's rights.
All these issues are part of development in the emerging United Nations definition. .
In his report entitled International Cooperation in Space Activities for Enhancing Security in the Post-Cold War Era (A/48/221, paragraph 17), the Secretary-General stated that it might be the time to examine ways to formalize international cooperation in the utilization of space systems and space technology for environmental purposes, particularly the implementation of the programmes recommended in Agenda 21, to ensure that all countries could obtain the information they needed to participate fully in the collective international effort.
It might also be said that it is time to examine how the use of space technology can contribute to the goals of the above-mentioned world conferences.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
. With the above-mentioned concepts in mind, the Conference discussed the following issues: (a) identifying appropriate technologies, techniques and data to support the planning and execution of projects; (b) developing awareness among decision makers of the cost-effectiveness of using space technology; (c) establishing follow-up networks and mechanisms for the exchange of information; and (d) education in space science and technology.
The discussions covered the use of satellites for Earth observation and communications.
In their observations and recommendations, which are presented below, the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments, national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development.
A. General observations and recommendations
. The Conference noted that, for a number of reasons, there was wide variation in the available resources and technological capabilities for using space technology among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
That applied to the use of Earth observation satellites for natural resource and environmental applications and the use of communications satellites for disaster prevention and relief and for the provision of basic services such as voice, video and data transmission for commercial purposes, rural education and rural health assistance.
. Better coordination of national space-related activities and increased awareness among countries of ongoing regional and global space-related programmes would result in their greater participation in those programmes and other space activities, making more direct and indirect benefits available to all countries.
It was noted that some countries had established or were in the process of establishing space agencies and that some countries had national space committees while others functioned through ad hoc mechanisms. .
The promotion of policies and actions leading to global sustainable development ought to be the concern of all countries.
Data and information from all countries in the region, including those with the least developed space-related capabilities, were needed to study the current state of and changes in the environment.
. In order to support the use of space technologies in sustainable development programmes or projects and in the diverse applications of satellite communications, all countries in the region needed to educate and train professionals and technicians in the fundamental and practical aspects involved in those technologies.
Recommendations
. States without a national entity to coordinate activities, to disseminate information and to advise on technical space matters should consider the desirability of establishing one. .
Regional priorities for technical cooperation should be identified; a survey of the state of space-related development of each country should be conducted at the national level in order to serve as a catalyst to enhance such cooperation and to promote the development of the least developed sectors and of those with the least installed capacities, bearing in mind the following:
(a) The survey should include space-related national organizational structures, if any, and should identify:
(i) National entities involved in space activities;
(ii) Priority areas for space applications;
(iii) Installed capacity in priority areas including main facilities for receiving and processing satellite data or for communications (satellite or ground-based);
(iv) Ongoing international cooperation programmes or projects;
(v) The existence and/or needs concerning qualified human resources, hardware and software;
(b) The results of the survey should be widely disseminated in order that countries, institutions and individuals could identify potential cooperation partners;
(c) Such a survey should be promoted by the United Nations with the assistance of space institutions in the region and interested international space agencies such as ESA.
. The indigenous development of space technologies in the region, particularly through regional and international cooperation, should be strengthened.
Conference participants from several institutions (i.e. Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Argentina; Asociaci√≥n Boliviana de Teledetecci√≥n para el Medio Ambiente; TeleBras; Agencia Espacial Brasileira; Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile; Comit√© de Actividades Espaciales of Chile; Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional of Costa Rica; Instituto de Geograf√≠a Tropical of Cuba; Instituto Mexicano de Comunicaciones; and Ministerio del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales Renovables of Venezuela) identified the following areas for regional cooperation involving institutions (other participants indicated interest in such cooperation but did not identify specific areas):
Integration of remotely sensed data; training in data processing and meteorological modelling; facilitating satellite data collection; working jointly on space propulsion systems, environmental impact, land degradation and desertification; integrating regional cooperative space applications projects; coastal and fishery applications; establishing benchmarks and testing connectivity devices in communication networks; and development and applications of new technologies for transmission of digital information.
(b) The network could be established through electronic mail, at minimal cost, by establishing its server at a national or international space institution and utilizing existing electronic mail nodes and computer equipment in the region.
Where those resources did not exist, they might be obtained through small local investments with the assistance of international funding institutions.
For its human element, the network would require that an individual or institution in each country be responsible for periodically updating national information of a general nature on a permanent bulletin board.
. There should be more education and training opportunities, particularly at the following levels: (a) in-depth education programmes leading to higher academic degrees (Master of Science or Ph.D.); (b) short, specialty or updating courses and workshops on specific project-related themes; (c) training courses for technicians on the use of specialized hardware or software; and (d) workshops lasting from one to three days on the potential and cost-effectiveness of the use of space technology for high-level decision makers and programme managers.
Various ongoing national and international efforts should be complemented through regional and international cooperation. .
The Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Latin America and the Caribbean, affiliated with the United Nations, should be supported as it would provide in-depth education in all space-related fields.
The Centre, to begin in 1996 with nodes in Brazil and Mexico, should, in due course, grow to establish programmes in other countries in order to use the full capacities of the region.
B. Earth observation satellites
. The Conference noted that the monitoring and gathering of environmental information were essential in characterizing a region, which was a necessary step in appropriate sustainable development planning and adequate territorial zoning.
The use of space technology, including data from diverse types of sensors and advanced satellite communications capabilities, could facilitate the timely and low-cost gathering of environmental and natural resource data.
. Once data were acquired by a satellite there was often a need to transmit such data to a functional ground-based satellite receiving station.
If that could not be done (many satellites did not carry on-board recorders) the information would be lost.
To a large extent, that was the current situation in Central America, parts of the Caribbean and the north-west portion of South America, which were covered by the satellite ground receiving station located at Cotopaxi, Ecuador.
Other gaps in data coverage existed in the region.
The Conference noted that efforts were currently being conducted through an Andean Group initiative to enable the regular operation of the satellite ground receiving station at Cotopaxi.
. The main obstacles to utilizing satellite data in the region were the access to and high cost of the data and not having a sufficient number of qualified professionals and technicians in the relevant disciplines.
Difficulties in demonstrating to high-level decision makers in developing countries that the use of space technology could be cost-efficient and could produce better and more timely results were intrinsically associated with those obstacles.
. It was also necessary to convince decision makers that an investment in the necessary equipment, data acquisition and training of qualified personnel for the operational use of satellite data would not need to be repeated in the short term due to rapidly evolving technologies.
. Alternative solutions to satellite data reception should be explored in order that valuable environmental data did not continue to be lost.
Alternative solutions, which were not mutually exclusive, included the following: (a) the continuous functioning of the satellite ground receiving station at Cotopaxi; (b) the installation of mobile antennas in States that would guarantee their continuous operation and access by all States to the data received; (c) the promotion among the satellite operators of greater use of on-board data recorders; and (d) the promotion of further support from international institutions and from the satellite operators for the satellite-receiving network of ground stations as sources of data for protecting the environment.
. Data formats should be standardized for all satellite systems, and space agencies should guarantee the continuous operation of their satellite systems in accordance with established parameters and data standards.
The work of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites should be encouraged and supported.
. A permanent programme for the systematic integral protection of the environment should be created at the regional level, bearing in mind the following:
(a) Such a programme should be associated and should work closely with the United Nations Environment Programme and with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme to address issues of a regional nature;
(b) The proposed programme would not need to be costly.
It would involve dissemination of information of recent, ongoing or proposed environment-related activities that could lead to joint or coordinated independent actions.
The exchange of experiences would also support sustainable development policies in countries in Latin America.
C. Communications satellites
. The Conference noted that disasters of natural or human origin, including environmental degradation were among the greatest obstacles to sustainable economic and social development.
In both situations, Earth observation and communications satellites could be used to great advantage for preventive and mitigation purposes.
Fixed and mobile communications satellites could provide the necessary means for disaster early warning systems.
Through the use of portable antennas or mobile communication units, the capability existed to restore in just a few hours vital communications connecting a disaster area to relief headquarters and to the outside world.
. Mobile satellite communications systems, domestic, regional and international, provided a robust and cost-effective means of re-establishing immediate communications in case of emergencies for the disaster relief operations.
Such systems could also be used to monitor environmental, seismic and meteorological variables for early warning or scientific purposes.
Considerable expertise in the use of mobile and fixed communications systems already existed in many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
That expertise was a good basis on which to build the telecommunications support needed by civil defence and emergency relief institutions.
That expertise could be augmented, and (in countries where it did not exist) built, by training provided by international organizations with experience in the relevant application fields.
. Establishing a telecommunications capability, whether land-based or satellite-based (or a hybrid of the two), was becoming essential to meet the basic needs of a developing society.
That capability could provide the means for normal telephone communications and commercial, entertainment and educational transmissions, in addition to reducing the cost of, or making possible, basic education and health services for rural populations.
. In order to be prepared for the occurrence of a disaster, all Governments in Latin America and the Caribbean had national disaster and emergency relief plans; however, satellite technology was often not used to the extent possible.
In such cases, Governments should prepare comprehensive plans for the use of telecommunications, including the use of fixed and mobile satellite communications systems, in their national disaster and emergency relief plans.
. In order to implement those plans, the funding required to acquire the equipment and for training in its use should be included in the national budgets for that sector.
Where needed, additional funding should be sought from international funding institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank. .
In the case of mobile communications equipment, a more recent technology, the relevant existing laws and regulations should be reviewed and modified with the aim of allowing the equipment to be moved at short notice in cases of emergency.
To promote the acquisition and routine use of such equipment, customs duties, licensing and setting of tariffs should reflect the high social value of the equipment for monitoring and early warning systems.
. A specialized forum should be established, possibly within the United Nations system, to discuss the range of mobile and fixed communications applications that could support the new national and global economic policies and to provide integral solutions aimed at specific economic sectors. That implied that communications facilities should be complemented with value-added services as a multiplying factor for the impact that they could have on economic development. .
The United Nations should play a crucial role in bringing together the many actors whose participation was required in order to improve the world's capability to deal with natural hazards and disasters.
. The United Nations should undertake the following: (a) enhance the database on natural hazards and the human-made conditions having a bearing on them, with special emphasis on high-risk locations; (b) facilitate sustained access of developed and developing countries to satellite-derived information to complement ground monitoring services; (c) develop means to effect the transfer of appropriate technology and financial support to the developing world, with specific applications in natural disaster prevention and mitigation; and (d) make natural hazard management an integral part of sustainable development efforts.
III. FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES
. During the Conference the representative of ESA had offered to explore the possibility of establishing such an information network at the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) facility of ESA at Frascati, Italy.
. Further to the proposal announced by the ESA representative during the final discussion at the Conference, work was started at ESRIN in December 1995 with the aim of providing an initial focal point for the quick and informal exchange of information to be made available to all who had participated at the Conference.
In order to ensure that similar opportunities are offered to all participants, the strategy being implemented entails the use of ESRIN communication facilities in the following way:
(a) Creation and updating of a dedicated homepage on the ESA/ESRIN World Wide Web (WWW) network (http://www.esrin.esa.it/);
(b) Simultaneous telefax or air mail distribution of that WWW information to participants not having access to electronic mail, using telefax transmission wherever possible;
(c) Setting up of a server to allow contributions from participants to be collected and viewed by others;
(d) Inclusion of contributions from the participants in the WWW homepage and their distribution via telefax and air mail;
(e) General use of the English and French languages, to comply with ESA rules.
The existing electronic mail link between the Office for Outer Space Affairs at Vienna and ESA/ESRIN at Frascati will ensure simultaneous communication with both institutions.
. The WWW homepage service is expected to start in February 1996; the first information note will be distributed to all participants of the Conference via telefax and air mail at the beginning of March 1996.
In a second step, the above communication tools will be made available to all participants of United Nations/ESA workshops and courses on the use of Earth observation satellite data and their applications to environmental and development issues, as well as to disaster relief and mitigation.
IV. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
A. Earth observation satellite systems
. It was stated at the Conference that the Earth observation programme of ESA included both meteorological and high-resolution systems.
The pre-operational meteorological programme had begun in 1977 and included Meteosat-1, Meteosat-2 and Meteosat-3, while the operational programme included Meteosat-4, Meteosat-5 and Meteosat-6.
Since 1 November 1995 the Meteosat programme had been operated by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), a European consortium, while ESA would continue to build and launch future spacecraft of the series.
Meteosat-7, scheduled to be launched in 1997, would mark the transition to Meteosat Second Generation.
The first of the series of second generation satellites was scheduled for launch in the year 2000.
. The first satellite of the European Remote Sensing Programme (ERS-1), launched in 1991, carried several microwave sensors on board.
Its primary instrument was the active microwave instrument (AMI), which could provide high-resolution images (in C-band) and wind speed through ocean wave spectra analyses.
While in an imaging mode, AMI covered a swath of 80-100 km, with a resolution of the order of 27 m in the range direction and 29 m in the azimuth direction.
Operating in wind mode, AMI covered a swath of 400-500 km over the ocean with resolution cells of 50 km and measured wind speed in the range of 4-24 m/s with an accuracy of 0.5-2 m/s.
. ERS-1 also carried a radar altimeter that operated at a wavelength of 2 cm.
The altimeter was used to measure average wave height and wind speed and to determine meso-scale ocean topography.
Data from the altimeter had been used successfully to determine ice type and topography, as well as water and ice boundaries.
. A third instrument on board ERS-1 was the along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR) that operated in three bands in the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The bands were centred around 3.7, 11 and 12 micrometres.
The ATSR looked through the atmosphere at the surface of the ocean from two directions, downwards vertically and at an incidence angle of 50 degrees.
The difference between the oblique and vertical measures provided information on atmospheric absorption while the differences between measurements at the three wavelengths were used to determine atmospheric water vapour content.
. The second satellite of the ERS programme (ERS-2) was launched on 21 April 1995 and was placed in the same orbit as ERS-1, following it with a difference of 31 minutes.
As the satellites were being operated in tandem, ERS-2 could visit a site 24 hours after ERS-1.
Such an arrangement allowed interferometric analysis that produced digital elevation models with a precision measurable in centimetres of the terrain being imaged.
In addition to the instruments carried by its predecessor, ERS-2 also carried Global Ozone Monitoring Equipment.
However, the ATSR instrument on board ERS-2 operated in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
. Although originally designed for ocean and ice applications, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained by ERS-1 and ERS-2 had been tested, with varying degrees of success, in agriculture, forestry, hydrology, cartography and geology and in monitoring natural hazards such as floods and mud-flows.
Near the coastline, SAR images had also found applications to aquaculture, mangrove forestry and coastal monitoring.
As such, they had become valuable data-gathering satellites to support environmental monitoring and sustainable development programmes.
. The ENVISAT-1 satellite was envisioned as an enhancement of the ERS programme.
However, in addition to contributing to environmental studies, the satellite would be an important tool for marine biology and atmospheric chemistry studies.
Its instruments would include advanced synthetic aperture radar, a Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars instrument, a medium resolution imaging spectrometer, a Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding, a radar altimeter (RA-2) and an advanced along-track scanning radiometer.
. Canada's Radarsat had been launched on 4 November 1995 carrying a SAR instrument on board that would operate in C-band with multi-mode single polarization.
Its polarization would be horizontal-horizontal (the terminology referred to the orientation of the microwave energy transmitted and received by the satellite's antenna).
The polarization property of microwaves was very useful in differentiating objects on the ground, as surfaces reflect differently depending on the polarization of the incident energy.
. Radarsat would have the capability of imaging swaths 50-500 km in width with associated resolutions of 10-100 m.
The instrument was designed with capabilities for the following five operating modes: standard (25 x 28 m resolution, 100 km swath), wide swath (25 x 28 m resolution, 150 km swath), fine resolution (11 x 9 m resolution, 50 km swath), ScanSAR (50 x 50 m and 100 x 100 m resolutions, 300 and 500 km swaths) and extended (10-20o and 50-60o incidence angles, 25 x 28 m resolution).
. The spacecraft, designed for a five-year lifetime, was in a Sun-synchronous orbit, dawn-to-dusk, with a 24-day repeat visit period and a three-day subcycle.
The SAR antenna would point north but the spacecraft was capable of rotating 180o about its yaw axis in order to obtain full coverage of the Antarctic.
Radarsat would operate with its antenna pointing south for a period of two weeks twice a year to allow full imaging of the Antarctic during its maximum and minimum coverage by ice.
. Because it would carry on-board recorders, Radarsat would be able to provide imagery of the entire globe.
The Radarsat instrument would be capable of collecting up to 28 minutes of SAR data during each of its orbits.
Radarsat mission operations would be coordinated by a mission management office which would serve as an interface between the user community, the mission control facility and the ground receiving and processing facilities.
The mission management office would monitor the entire data distribution, which would be carried out mainly by Radarsat International.
. The first Brazilian satellite, data collection satellite (SCD-1), had been in orbit at an altitude of 760 km for 16 months.
The second, SCD-2, would be similar to the first in its objective but would incorporate technical improvements and was expected to be launched in 1996.
Each of the spin-stabilized satellites had an approximate mass of 100 kg.
Their mission was to retransmit environmental data obtained by low-cost data collection platforms on the surface of the Earth.
. SCD-1 was already performing its functions, covering all of Brazil, and had the capability of servicing adjacent areas.
Neighbouring States had already expressed their interest in signing cooperation agreements through which SCD-1 data would be made available to them at no cost.
The services provided by SCD-1 could be extended to cover all tropical and subtropical areas of the globe.
Development work had already started on SCD-3, which, besides functioning as a data collection satellite, would serve to test equipment for mobile communications.
B. Satellite communications
. It was universally recognized that the information and telecommunications industries were part of the global economy.
They both contributed to, and benefited from, growth of gross national product (GNP).
It was also generally recognized that there was a correlation (though cause and effect had not been established) between levels of investment in telecommunications and levels of per capita GNP.
. Nearly two thirds of the current world population did not have access to basic telephone services.
In some developing countries telephone density was as low as 0.1 per cent, while in some developed countries it reached 60 per cent.
In many developing countries, the majority of telephones were located in cities while, at the same time, the majority of the population lived in small towns and communities.
That was a result of the services being offered where there was a demand from segments of the population which represented larger economic and commercial benefits.
. If the demand for national communications was a derived demand, then its growth was generated by the needs of the economy and society.
The same applied to the concept of a global economy and a global society.
It had already been recognized in some developed countries that the promotion of systems with only national coverage was not justified.
Consideration was being increasingly given to the idea that in order to promote international trade, the development of global transport and telecommunication systems was required.
. The above assertions appeared to be justified by the fact that telecommunications and information technologies were among the markets with the largest growth.
Their expansion was creating growth in the corresponding manufacturing industry, which was an indication of the multiplying effects that those technologies had on other sectors of the productive chain. Indeed, they could become economic engines for other sectors.
. Satellite communications had evolved very rapidly under the stimulus of important changes in national legislations affecting the communications sector around the world, and particularly in Latin America, aimed at promoting private investment and modernizing the infrastructure so that it could assimilate the rapid technological changes.
. Fixed and mobile satellite communication systems represented support for the industrial, commercial, service and social welfare sectors.
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global, regional, national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations.
They were also used in long-distance trunking links and when there was a need to access remote users requiring wide-band digital services.
Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) antennas had reduced the complexity and cost of data and information networks.
Developments in the areas of VSAT and mobile communication technologies had provided the means for efficient end-to-end services.
Those developments, coupled with relatively high costs of using terrestrial circuits, had resulted in a surge of corporate and public communications networks.
. Mobile satellite communications were still in their initial stages of development, with a few satellites in geostationary orbits and, in the near future, with satellites in low Earth orbits.
Those communications were currently oriented to fulfil the demand coming from mobile users (e.g. transport fleets), from difficult access locations (e.g. offshore oil rigs, mines), from rural communities and from emergency warning and disaster relief operations.
. Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications, their development would depend on the evolution of important factors, such as technological progress, the availability of orbital positions (for geostationary satellites), spectral bandwidths, costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services.
. In spite of the impressive growth of global networks such as the Internet, most applications for global use had still not been developed.
Projects were under way to make new systems available, such as the Global Information Infrastructure and Project G7.
For instance, Project G7 considered applications in such areas as education, libraries, museums, natural resource and environmental administration, emergency situations, health services, government use, maritime transport and commercial transactions for small enterprises.
For the development of many of those applications, it would be necessary to develop generic, value-added public services at the national and global levels.
. For some countries the use of fixed satellite communication services, such as those provided by INTELSAT, might be the choice.
Through the use of such services, countries could reduce costs and the risks associated with designing, launching and operating their own satellite systems.
Other countries might find it cost-effective to combine the use of their national systems with well-established systems such as those operated by INTELSAT.
Such an approach would provide users with access to state-of-the-art technology and to technical advice from the organization.
C. Satellite-based technology for sustainable development
. It was stated that when natural hazards impacted on human communities or destroyed property, they were considered disasters.
Not all natural hazards were disasters; fires, floods, earthquakes and drought all existed as part of natural cycles.
Thus, a disaster occurred when an extreme event coincided with a vulnerable situation, surpassing society's ability to manage the consequences.
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences, natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries, increasing debt, reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs.
Those impacts had long-term effects on the economic health of the countries concerned.
. Developing countries had few surveillance, early warning and disaster response programmes and, when confronted with catastrophic events, had to make decisions in a situation of shock, using outdated or incomplete communication and transportation systems and not having the benefit of an adequate information base.
That was what made natural hazard management a development issue.
Sustainable development thus reduced the population at risk and enabled a country to take adequate precautionary measures and to reduce the impact when precautionary measures were not sufficient.
. Since 1960, hurricanes, floods, droughts, desertification and landslides in Latin America and the Caribbean had killed over 200,000 people, disrupted the lives of some 100 million others and caused over US$ 50 billion in property damage.
Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes had taken the highest toll in terms of human lives and their financial consequences could be of the same order of magnitude.
Drought had threatened the economic survival of the largest number of people and the economic losses due to floods rivalled those of earthquakes.
. Drought and desertification were becoming a major source of alarm in Latin America, particularly along the Pacific coast of Chile and Peru, with milder but advancing traces in the coast of Ecuador.
Very severe desert conditions were present in La Pampa in Argentina and in Chihuahua in Mexico.
Severe desertification was evident in several provinces in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and Peru.
Those symptoms could usually be attributed to some combination of exploitative land management and natural climate processes.
. Salinization, frequently associated with desertification, was most often a result of uncontrolled and unwise irrigation resulting from lack of adequate water management policies and the prevalence of farming techniques inappropriate to the conditions of highly stressed soils.
Remote sensing data and the use of geographical information systems had been successfully used in a sustainable development project in Valle de Tulum, Argentina, where natural terrain conditions and agricultural practices had resulted in significant salinization of large areas and consequently in lower productivity of the valley.
. Each year, several hurricanes struck the Caribbean, sometimes causing damage amounting to billions of United States dollars (e.g. Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989).
Countries that had sustained the greatest damage, in terms of the number of people affected, included Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica.
Mexico normally experienced numerous hurricanes in the Yucat√°n peninsula.
In Central America hurricanes had caused not only human suffering, but also severe damage measured in economic terms; Honduras and Nicaragua had been among the worst affected countries.
. Space-based technology could help risk assessment concerning natural hazards by providing information to support the following tasks: (a) determination of the study area; (b) identification of natural hazards in the project area; (c) identification of population and structures at risk, and definition of their characteristics (size, location) and factors affecting their susceptibility to specific risks; and (d) identification and technical analysis of alternative mitigation measures.
. Fixed and mobile communications satellites could provide the necessary means for disaster early warning systems.
Through the use of portable antennas or mobile communication units, the capability existed to restore in just a few hours vital communications connecting the area affected by a disaster to relief headquarters and to the outside world.
. Remote sensing techniques were particularly useful in the identification of areas subject to high natural hazard risks.
This was because almost all geologic, hydrologic and atmospheric phenomena that created hazardous situations were recurrent events that left behind some evidence of their occurrence, allowing an observer to trace their origin, process and impact.
. Earthquakes presented a peculiarly difficult subject for risk assessment, as the frequency of their occurrence might be in cycles of decades or centuries, rendering remotely sensed historical observations irrelevant.
However, in areas with a history of earthquake activity, faults associated with seismic activity could be identified using satellite imagery.
Radar imagery was an ideal data source for that purpose.
The availability of satellite radar data would reduce the cost of studying large areas or covering specific events compared with the cost of doing it by conventional means.
Early warning of impending disasters .
It was stated that results of risk analyses to detect an area's vulnerability to a natural disaster provided valuable information to the decision maker.
Probability analysis followed to approximate a level of certainty that would warrant advising local authorities about the likelihood of an impending disaster.
Perhaps the most important step in that phase was the translation of collected information into a format that could be easily understood by the decision maker.
Satellite images were capable of providing a synoptic view of the problem and were particularly useful for that purpose.
Mitigation activities .
It was stated that, among global environmental problems, natural hazards presented the most manageable of situations as the risks were most readily identified, effective mitigation measures were available and the benefits of reducing vulnerability more often than not outweighed the costs of prevention.
The impact of natural hazards could be reduced by favouring non-intensive uses in high-risk areas.
Monitoring activities
. It was stated that the objectives of an emergency monitoring system were: (a) to provide national protection agencies and relevant research institutions with information to support strategic and emergency decisions; (b) to re-establish the telecommunications and environmental data collection systems when an event had occurred in order to coordinate the local relief operations from the coordinating centre and to collect real-time environmental data; and (c) to assess real-time and a posteriori damages, data that would be useful for understanding the phenomenon and its consequences.
. The monitoring of natural hazards was particularly useful where long-term processes were involved.
Remotely sensed data had proved extremely useful in such cases, since repeated readings of surface changes, ground coverage and other factors could be made available by satellite imagery.
The role of national and international institutions
. It was stated that pure scientific, applied and experimental research relevant to natural hazard management was required.
As such research involved a large part of the principal fields covered in earth sciences and social research, the need was opening up niches for many actors in that area.
However, funding for all forms of research was encountering great problems, particularly in developing countries, where other priorities seemed more urgent to decision makers.
More recently, the private sector (industries, special interest groups) had entered the scene, providing services that constituted either input to or processed output for research endeavours.
The possible relationships needed to be examined as those groups had the potential to become major contributors in that area.
. Beyond research needs, disasters caused by natural hazards generated a demand for significant additional amounts of capital influx to support countries in their efforts to restore services and structures and to ease human suffering.
Prime contributors to covering those financial needs were governmental (bilateral) donors, non-governmental relief services and multilateral financial institutions.
. Multilateral development agencies had financed and continued to finance natural hazard assessment and disaster relief efforts, but did so mostly as part of other investment or technical assistance operations. Consequently, figures depicting specific support in that area were not easily derived from financial statistics.
The World Bank had approved operations of environmental content (environmental institution-building, environmental management and pollution control, and natural resource management) for a total of US$ 5.10 billion in a four-year period (1989-1993), of which US$ 1.234 billion had been earmarked for Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Inter-American Development Bank had allocated a total of US$ 4.842 billion to the region also for a four-year period (1990-1994).
Both institutions were required to analyse natural hazard prevention and mitigation opportunities as part of project preparation.
V. CONCLUSION
. The peculiar circumstances that surround developing countries are such that satellite communications and remote sensing can be of greatest help in most areas of sustainable development, although the acquisition of highly developed technology is considered a luxury item.
To change that situation, efforts to convince high-level decision makers of the usefulness of space technology need to be intensified.

Annex.
A. Background and objectives . At its thirty-seventh session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, in which it endorsed the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82) that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should, inter alia, stimulate the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries, and promote greater cooperation in space science and technology between developed and developing countries as well as among developing countries.
The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), at its thirty-seventh session in June 1994, endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1995 as proposed by the Expert on Space Applications (A/AC.105/555) and as recommended by its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session.
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994, endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1995.
. In response to Assembly resolution 49/34, and in accordance with the UNISPACE 82 recommendations, the Programme on Space Applications included, as part of its activities for 1995, the organization of a Training Course for Asia and the Pacific Countries on Applications of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) Data to Natural Resources, Renewable Sources of Energy and the Environment.
It was the third in a series of similar training courses that were organized for the benefit of African French-speaking countries (1993) and Latin American and Caribbean countries (1994).
. The United Nations/European Space Agency Training Course for Asia and the Pacific Countries on Applications of the European Remote Sensing Satellite Data to Natural Resources, Renewable Sources of Energy and the Environment was organized jointly by the Programme on Space Applications, the Office for Outer Space Affairs and the Department for Development Support and Management Services (DDSMS) of the Secretariat, in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). .
The objectives of the Course were as follows: (a) to provide participants from the region of Asia and the Pacific with a theoretical basis and practical experience in various aspects of microwave remote sensing, focusing on the applications of that technology to natural resources, sources of renewable energy and, in particular, its use in conducting inventories and monitoring the environment; and (b) to familiarize the participants with the operational services of ERS-1 and -2 satellites (for example, data coverage, data sources and products processing levels) and with the bibliography and archives of ERS materials and data available at the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) facility at Frascati, Italy.
. The Course was held at the ESA/ESRIN facility from 13 to 24 November 1995.
It was attended by 14 participants from the following countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Financial support to defray the cost of international air travel and living expenses of the participants was provided by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and the United Nations Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy.
The programme for the Course (see annex) was developed jointly by ESA and the United Nations (Office for Outer Space Affairs).
The lecturers came from France, Spain and ESA.
. The Course provided participants with the physical theory on which remote sensing, both active and passive, is based.
The Course presented an overall view of remote sensing in various intervals of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the visible, infrared and microwave regions, and highlighted the multidisciplinary nature of the use of the data.
Since the ERS-1 and -2 payloads are composed mostly of active radar instrumentation, the Course emphasized active microwave remote sensing.
The Course included the theory and concepts of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation, as well as an introduction to digital image processing of radar data in oceanographic, geologic, hydrological, topographic and cartographic applications.
The Course also provided the participants with examples of the applications of the data received from the various instruments on board ERS-1 and -2 satellites, as well as with hands-on experience in digital processing of microwave image products.
The complementary information that can be obtained from optical and radar data was stressed as a powerful asset for remote sensing.
Presentations made by the lecturers included case-studies of programmes or projects conducted in Asia and the Pacific.
. The United Nations and ESA took advantage of the presence of participants representing institutions in 14 countries in the region of Asia and the Pacific to further develop the concept of a programme proposal that could provide satellite data for institutions in developing countries.
That concept had originated during the first course, for African French-speaking countries, held at Frascati in 1993, and had further evolved during the second course, for Latin American and Caribbean countries, in 1994.
The concept discussed by the participants and co-sponsors of the Course is summarized in section I below.
. The present report, which covers the background, objectives and organization of the Course, has been prepared for COPUOS and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
The participants in the Course have reported on the knowledge acquired and on the work conducted during the Course to the appropriate government authorities, universities and research institutions in their own countries.
. Together with satellite systems of other national agencies, the remote sensing satellites of ESA contribute to observing the Earth and its environment in a systematic, global and accurate manner.
Through modern technology they provide measurements of physical parameters of the ocean-land-atmosphere system with continuity, compatibility and full coverage, night and day.
Where supported by operational ground acquisition stations, they ensure long-term observations and yield time-series of consistent and calibrated remote sensing data that may be used to build up a history of parameters describing a physical phenomenon such as climate.
From such a history, characteristics, trends and anomalies of the phenomenon could be identified.
. Given the capability of microwave radiation to penetrate clouds, ERS provides all-weather images of the Earth surface and allows the monitoring of surface features even in areas, such as over equatorial and polar regions, where optical instrumentation fails because of frequent or permanent cloud coverage.
In addition, radar images provide information on surface geometry and humidity that significantly complements surface albedo and temperature data provided by optical satellites, making remote sensing observations a very powerful and versatile tool for applications to environmental disciplines.
The nature of such satellite data is in effect multidisciplinary, since they can be used simultaneously for many applications and different operational requirements.
Directly or through ESA services, national institutions may gather and archive the data, and, if required, further process them to serve their users in fields as diverse as geology, oceanography, hydrology, meteorology, glaciology, forestry, agriculture, topography, cartography, land use and environmental matters ranging from urban settlement to pollution monitoring.
. During the courses held at Frascati in 1993 and 1994, the participants had indicated that two obstacles to the utilization of image products such as those covered in the courses were the lack of access to them and the need for further education on the principles of their use, together with hands-on training to develop experience in the mechanics of analysis.
The representatives of the Secretariat and ESA had indicated that they would explore ways and means of providing at least a limited amount of data and further training for the ongoing activities of the participants.
. After the first course held in 1993, representatives of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, DDSMS and ESA discussed the issue and drew the following conclusions:
(a) For the courses to achieve their objectives fully, it was essential that participants returning home should have access to satellite data and to the necessary image-processing software in order to strengthen their newly acquired skills;
(b) Institutions with ongoing projects would be the most likely to need and utilize the data;
(c) The co-sponsors could develop a programme proposal for building capacities and strengthening institutions, through which a limited amount of data, necessary software and further training could be provided to some institutions in developing countries.
. The development of the programme would include the following three phases: (a) needs assessment to determine the degree of interest of institutions in the regions participating in the programme and the quantities and types of data needed; (b) identification of ongoing projects that are using or could use satellite data in the regions of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean; and (c) selection of projects on the basis of those remote sensing applications that were in greatest demand in the regions concerned.
Subsequently, the programme would be presented by the co-sponsors, with the endorsement of the institutions and their Governments, to potential funding sources.
The data provided by the programme would not be limited to ERS-1 and -2 data, but, on the basis of project requirements, could originate from other satellites (for example, the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) and the Satellite Syst√®me Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)) or from a combination of satellites in order to take advantage of the complementary nature of data obtained by satellites.
. During implementation of the above-mentioned programme, the data needs of several ongoing projects were to be submitted to the United Nations (Office for Outer Space Affairs and DDSMS) and ESA by participants in the first two training courses held at Frascati in 1993 and 1994.
The first series of submissions came from Latin America, and were integrated thematically into modules that the co-sponsors were to present to potential financial contributors.
A similar process was also under way for Africa, using input received from participants in other training courses jointly organized by the United Nations and ESA in the region.
. The above-mentioned programme was presented to the participants in the Course held in 1995, with an invitation to participate in the project and to contribute to the first two phases of the programme.
The participants expressed great interest in the offer.
A number of discussions took place to consider the issues related to phases (a) and (b) described in paragraph 14 above.
The United Nations and ESA provided additional information and assisted the participants in the discussions.
. During discussion of possible follow-up projects at the conclusion of the Course, the participants emphasized that ERS data could provide vital input for applications to the monitoring of natural resources, renewable sources of energy and the environment.
They identified a number of projects that could benefit from ERS data, some of them ongoing projects involving the institutions or agencies of the participants.
Discussing issues related to availability, accessibility and practical applications of ERS data, the participants noted, among other things, that present and potential users of the data should be more exposed to and trained in the basic sciences underlying microwave remote sensing technology, so that they could more fully benefit from the use of both the technology and the relevant data.
The limited availability of data and the lack of appropriate hardware and software needed for ERS data processing were the other obstacles to routine utilization of radar images.
It was also noted that combining ERS radar data with optical data would speed up the adoption of microwave technology, by supplementing existing operational methods of optical remote sensing.
That would assist in overcoming the cloud-cover problem in the region, and the complementary data would be especially useful in such applications as map updating, temporal monitoring and hazard assessment.
. The United Nations and ESA informed the participants that the co-sponsors would conduct, on the basis of submissions received from the institutions and agencies of the participants, a survey to assess the needs of the region as a preparatory phase in the process of developing the programme proposal referred to above.
The co-sponsors would keep the participants and their institutions informed of the progress that was made.
The participants were also informed that the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA were jointly organizing a workshop on microwave remote sensing applications to be held at Manila in April 1996 for the benefit of developing countries in the region of Asia and the Pacific.
The planned workshop would provide an opportunity to continue the process of needs assessment and selection of ongoing projects for further consideration.
II. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
. The training programme offered in the Course was similar to that of courses organized for the African French-speaking countries in 1993 and for the Latin American and Caribbean countries in 1994.
A detailed overview of topics presented at the Course is contained in the report on the United Nations/European Space Agency Training Course for Latin American and Caribbean Countries on the Monitoring of Natural Resources, Renewable Sources of Energy and the Environment using Data from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) (A/AC.105/594).
III. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
. During discussion at the conclusion of the Course, the participants made a number of recommendations, which may be summarized as follows:
(a) Pilot projects on the application of microwave remote sensing data in the region of Asia and the Pacific should be initiated at the earliest opportunity and with financial assistance coming from various donor agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and ESA;
(b) At least two training courses on applications of ERS data should be organized by the United Nations and ESA for countries in the region of Asia and the Pacific.
The duration of the training programmes should be at least six weeks, and emphasis should be placed on practical exercises;
(c) Upon request by States of the region, the United Nations and ESA, in cooperation with other donor agencies, should provide technical and financial assistance in establishing ERS data-processing facilities;
(d) The number of participants in the long-term fellowship and on-job training programmes offered by the United Nations and ESA in the area of ERS data applications should be increased.
. The participants in the course expressed their commitment to following up the work discussed in relation to the programme proposal to be prepared by the United Nations and ESA.
In that connection, they would inform the authorities of their institutions, and submit to the co-sponsors a brief overview of the objectives and current status of their ongoing projects.
The overview would include specific details concerning the type and quantity of the satellite data required.
. The participants expressed their appreciation for the technical quality of the training programme delivered to them, for the fellowships received from the co-sponsors, which had made their participation in the Course possible, as well as for the cooperation and support provided by the administrative and technical personnel of ESRIN.Annex PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE

A. Background and objectives
. The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, decided, upon the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82),See Report of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Vienna, 9-21 August 1982 (A/CONF.101/10 and Corr.1 and 2), para. 430. that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should, inter alia, stimulate the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries and promote greater cooperation in space science and technology between developed and developing countries as well as among developing countries.
The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its thirty-seventh session, held in June 1994, endorsed the programme of United Nations workshops, training courses and seminars proposed for 1995, as outlined by the Expert on Space Applications in his report (A/AC.105/555, paragraph 62).Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/49/20), para. 37.
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994, endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1995.
. In response to General Assembly resolution 49/34, and in accordance with the UNISPACE 82 recommendations, the organization of a Conference on Optics in Space Science and Technology was included as part of the activities for 1995 of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The Conference was jointly organized and sponsored by the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).
It was held from 20 to 24 November 1995 at Trieste, Italy.
. The Conference focused on the applications of optics in space science and technology, paying special attention to current and future developments in space-based optical instruments used in remote sensing, telecommunications, astronomy and astrophysics.
Matters related to education in space science and technology and to the development of international cooperation between scientists working in those fields were considered by the Conference as well.
. The present report, which covers the background, objectives, organization and recommendations of the Conference, as well as a summary of the papers presented, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants have reported to the appropriate authorities in their countries.
B. Organization and programme of the Conference
The Conference was attended by 52 experts, scientists and educators.
The participants came from the following countries: Argentina, Belarus, China, Czech Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, Ghana, Guinea, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Nigeria, Romania, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, United States of America, Viet Nam, Zaire and Zimbabwe.
The Office for Outer Space Affairs, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and ICTP were represented at the Conference. .
Funds allocated by the United Nations for the organization of the Conference were used to defray the cost of international air travel of 15 participants from developing countries.
Hotel accommodations and daily subsistence allowances for participants from developing countries, as well as conference facilities, technical support and documentation for the Conference, were provided by ICTP.
. The programme of the Conference (see annex to the present report) was developed jointly by the United Nations and ICTP.
Participants at the Conference discussed issues related to international cooperation in the development of optical instruments for applications in remote sensing, astronomy and space communications.
. At the conclusion of the Conference, the participants expressed their appreciation of the scientific and technical quality of the programme and the presentations.
In addition, they expressed their appreciation for the fellowships that they had received from the co-sponsors, which had made their participation in the Conference possible, as well as for the cooperation and support that they had received from administrative and technical personnel of ICTP.
I. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CONFERENCE
A. Observations of the Conference
. The Conference discussion focused on the participation of developing countries in international scientific and technical exchange and cooperation.
The Conference observed that international cooperation played a vital role in the development of space science and technology.
It was noted that most space-based instruments for astronomical or astrophysical observations were designed, constructed, launched and maintained in orbit by cooperating groups of countries.
In the field of Earth observation, regional and international programmes such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and Mission to Planet Earth provided the international research community with the opportunity to address effectively such issues as global warming and climate change, ozone layer depletion, global deforestation, land degradation and management of the coastal marine environment.
. It was noted that the development of new space-based communications systems with a higher communication capacity and more compact, lighter equipment for future space activities also required cooperative efforts such as the technology demonstration experiment for optical inter-orbit communications planned by the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan and the European Space Agency.
Two spacecraft - the Optical Inter-Orbit Communications Engineering Test Satellite and the geostationary satellite of the African Real-Time Environmental Monitoring using Imaging Satellites (ARTEMIS) system - would be involved in the experiment.
. The Conference noted that the participation of scientists, researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects, as well as in international scientific information exchange, was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources (both financial and human), but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information.
The Conference noted that international efforts were required to bridge the gap between scientific communities in developing and developed countries. .
The Conference emphasized the importance of efforts of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, within the framework of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, aimed at establishing regional centres for space science and technology education in developing countries and at establishing a satellite-based information network system, the Cooperative Information Network Linking Scientists, Educators and Professionals in Africa (COPINE), which would link scientific, research and educational institutions in participating African countries to similar centres in Europe, as well as in Africa, with the initial aim of improving the exchange of scientific and technical information.
. The Conference also noted with satisfaction the efforts of ICTP to support scientific and information exchange within the global scientific community.
Through an intensive programme of workshops and conferences, as well as through its large network of affiliated centres in developing countries, ICTP contributed greatly to the education process at the international level.
B. Recommendations of the Conference
. On the basis of the discussion, the Conference made a number of recommendations aimed at enhancing the role of scientists and researchers from developing countries in international scientific cooperation.
Those recommendations may be summarized as follows:
(a) Scientists, researchers and educators from developing countries should have more opportunities for in-depth training in the design, construction and applications of space-based optical instruments used in remote sensing, telecommunications, astronomy and astrophysics;
(b) International efforts should promote the adequate transfer of appropriate technologies from developed countries to developing countries, and universities and research centres in developing countries should actively participate in that process;
(c) A follow-up conference should be held in three years and regional workshops on the subjects covered by the Conference should be organized as well;
(d) Distribution of scientific and technical information should be promoted in order to keep researchers in developing countries informed of the latest developments in the field;
(e) A "focal point" for information on opportunities and possibilities for participation in international cooperative projects should be established;
(f) Five per cent of the scientific payloads of spacecraft should be devoted to instruments and/or experiments developed by research institutions in developing countries;
(g) United Nations efforts aimed at establishing regional centres for space science and technology education, as well as the COPINE project, should be encouraged and supported.
II. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
A. Use of space-based lasers in remote sensing, communications and instrumentation
. It was stated that the feasibility of using ground-based and airborne laser systems in remote sensing, communications and instrumentation had been demonstrated in numerous projects worldwide.
With recent advances in the development of new materials and improvements in the lifetime, frequency stability and reliability of lasers to be used in space, the development of spaceborne laser systems was approaching its operational stage.
Some experiments had already been performed on the Space Shuttle, and several instruments were planned for use on missions in the near future.
. Major efforts in the development of space-based laser systems were devoted to remote sensing instrumentation.
In fact, the application of light detection and ranging (lidar) instruments was considered an extremely promising new way of obtaining essential atmospheric and geophysical parameters on a global scale.
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development: (a) the back scatter lidar, with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology; (b) the differential absorption lidar (DIAL), which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity, temperature and pressure; (c) the Doppler lidar, with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies; and (d) the ranging and altimeter lidar, which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth's surface features.
. Spaceborne laser systems could also play an important role in the area of inter-satellite and inter-orbit communications.
The request for optical systems originated in the need for smaller payloads and/or equipment, broader bandwidths and more reliable data links.
. In future space missions, lasers, especially very small, lightweight semiconductor emitters, would often be incorporated into standard attitude control instruments and into scientific payloads.
The equipment under development included, for example, laser gyroscopes, as well as narrow-band spectrometers which required a compact and stable internal calibration source.
B. Spectrum-UV mission: an internationl ultraviolet laboratory
. It was stated that the Spectrum-UV mission was an international ultraviolet observatory for solar spectroscopy and wide field imaging of the Sun.
Launch aboard a Spectrum-series space platform into a seven-day, highly eccentric orbit (HEO) by a Proton booster from the Baikonour launch pad was currently scheduled for the year 2001.
The spacecraft's initial orbit, with a perigee of 500 km and an apogee of 300,000 km, met the criteria of stability of the operational orbit during the expected three-year lifetime of the mission, as well as the criteria of quasi-continuous visibility from ground stations in the Russian Federation and Ukraine and of rapid evolution of the perigee altitude to reach 40,000 km one year from launch.
. The mission would be operated in real-time mode in order to fully utilize the advantage of long, uninterrupted observation sessions allowed by injection in HEO, including flexible scheduling, on-line monitoring of data quality, and fine-tuning of observation modes and exposure time.
In order to make effective use of spacecraft during periods of non-visibility from ground stations or occasional unavailability of the network of the Deep Space Communications Centre, a fully automated operation mode would also be implemented.
. The primary scientific payload of the satellite consisted of an f/10 Ritchey-Chr√©tien configuration telescope with a 170 cm aperture.
Mirror coating (Al + MgF2) was optimized for enhanced and normal incidence reflection in the 900-1,500 angstrom band.
In-flight correction of the thin (10 cm) primary mirror was ensured by a system of actuators.
Secondary mirror rotation ensured 0.1 arcsec pointing and tracking accuracy within the 2.5 arcsec accuracy of the platform's attitude and orbit control system.
. Complementary instrumentation consisted of:
(a) A dual √âchelle spectrograph with three independent channels covering, respectively, 1,150-1,800, 1,780-3,500 and 1,150-3,500 angstrom intervals;
(b) A spectrograph in the Rowland mounting with three independent channels covering, respectively, 900-1,050 and 1,050-1,200; 1,150-1,900 and 1,300-1,900; and 1,150-4,000 angstrom intervals;
(c) A 4 x 4 sq arcmin field of view direct camera for wide and narrow band imaging in the 912-3,600 angstrom range with a resolution of 0.3 arcsec; a narrow field of view (10 x 10 sq arcsec) camera for imaging at a restored resolution of 0.03 arcsec was also being considered.
. An advanced feasibility study of the mission was being carried out by an international research team supported by space agencies of the four participating countries: Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
C. Trends in satellite communications
. It was stated that, at the World Administrative Radio Conference held at Torremolinos, Spain, in 1992, there had been signs of a revival of the enthusiasm displayed at the advent of satellite communications in 1965, when the first commercial satellite - the Early Bird - had been launched.
Apart from traditional telecommunications services, satellite technology had found increasing applications in rural telecommunications, direct and digital broadcasting (sound and television) and mobile telecommunications (land, maritime and aeronautical), as well as in global computer networking.
. The general trend was towards the development of a universal personal telecommunications system that would allow communications with network interface selected by a customer.
Satellites would continue to play a major role in the new wireless personal communications system, the global information infrastructure and the future public land mobile telecommunications system.
The latter system would provide telecommunications facilities particularly adapted to the needs of developing countries on account of its (a) capability for rapid provision of services in new areas; (b) growth capacity and flexibility; (c) potential for cost reductions resulting from technology advancement and mass production; and (d) capability for covering large geographical areas.
. Breakthroughs in microcircuit technologies had made it possible to "pack" an entire satellite communications ground terminal into a hand-held telephone unit, as well as to use satellites in non-geostationary orbits, such as low Earth orbits (LEO) and medium Earth orbits (MEO), for mobile telecommunications.
LEO microsatellites could benefit from technical characteristics that made that technology well suited both for mobile voice, data and messaging services and for fixed communications services, especially monitoring and control applications.
The main advantages allowed by a constellation of LEO and MEO satellites were: the low cost of individual satellites; the limited complexity of satellites; limited system design and production time; the use of small launching vehicles and the placing into orbit of a group of satellites (6-8) with a single launch; the increased reliability; the use of low-cost hand-held terminals; and global coverage.
. The inter-satellite link (ISL) was a further development of the on-board processing concept utilized in some communications satellite constellations.
ISL could be used for direct "repeaterless" communication between intercluster satellites; co-located satellites; interregional satellites (GEO to GEO); and LEO and GEO satellites.
In comparison with ISL based on microwave technology, optical ISL payloads had some advantages, especially in weight and size of equipment.
. Some optical communications subsystems of ISL payloads under development were based on the following technologies:
(a) Carbon dioxide laser system with heterodyne detection receiver;
(b) Neodymium-doped laser system with direct detection receiver;
(c) InGaAsP laser system with a neodymium power amplifier and direct detection receiver;
(d) GaAlAs laser system with direct detection receiver;
(e) GaAlAs laser system with direct wavelength division multiplexing and direct detection receiver;
(f) GaAlAs laser system with heterodyne detection receiver.
Test results for both analog and digital traffic had indicated a preference for the ISL system based on the GaAlAs semiconductor diode laser because of its small size, high electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency, direct modulation capability, broad wavelength selectability, and potential for high reliability.
Furthermore, the high level of research and development in the field of GaAlAs technology promised rapid advances in the development of GaAlAs diode laser communications systems.
D. Submilli-arcsecond astrometry Struve mission . It was stated that the Struve space astrometric project was under development at the Pulkovo Observatory at St. Petersburg, Russian Federation.
The aim of the project was to obtain more accurate measurements of parameters of stars covered by the Hipparcos satellite and to extend the reference system to 100 reference stars per square degree (4.1 million stars in the output catalogue).
The accuracy of observations was expected to be improved in comparison with the Hipparcos mission.
. The geometrical principle of measurements was similar to that of the Hipparcos mission, but two basic angles of 62 degrees and 74 degrees had been chosen instead of a single one in order to minimize systematic errors of observations.
Accordingly, two telescopes, each with a focal length of 2.5 m, would be installed on board the Struve spacecraft.
Two basic angles would be formed by a beam combiner placed inside the spacecraft.
A special optical system would be used for passive control of image scales and stability of the telescope components.
. The registration system of the instrument consisted of two micrometers and an on-board processing unit.
Two-phased charge-coupled devices were to be used as micrometers for both telescopes.
Flux from each registered star would be measured in seven visual wavebands that would also allow researchers to obtain information on the physical properties of the observed stars.
. The Struve spacecraft had a symmetrical shape to reduce the impact of solar light (i.e. to minimize torque on the spacecraft).
Additional surfaces were to be installed at edges of the solar panels in order to make the centre of solar pressure coincide with the centre of mass of the spacecraft.
The satellite payload did not contain any moving devices or parts because they created inner torque that might disturb the spacecraft's smooth rotation.
. The three-year Struve mission was to be launched soon after the year 2000, approximately a decade after the Hipparcos mission.
The Struve output catalogue would allow astronomers to establish a fundamental coordinate system with a higher level of accuracy and to extend it to fainter stars in comparison with the Hipparcos catalogue.
It would also bring a new level of accuracy to studies on structure and dynamics of the Galaxy and on evolution and chemical properties of stars. E. New technologies for Earth observations and astronomy .
A number of presentations made at the Conference were devoted to new technologies and materials applicable to the design and construction of optical instruments used in astronomy (both ground-based and space-based) and in remote sensing.
Developments in design and manufacturing of small satellites and microsatellites and platforms for Earth observation and astronomical missions were discussed in detail as well.
. It was stated that modern science required an extremely high imaging performance and quality of astronomical instruments.
For ground-based systems, a resolution better than 0.5 arcsec and higher could be considered a standard requirement, but in some observation projects a resolution of 0.3 arcsec could be requested.
For space-based instruments, the theoretical limit of the optics used was the only performance ceiling (except, naturally, such a limiting factor as budget constraints).
New technologies, advanced manufacturing processes and new materials might make it possible to achieve increased performance at reduced cost.
Active optics, computer-assisted polishing and ion-shaping of mirrors, and silicon-carbide mirror technology were typical examples of applications of new technologies for astronomical optics manufacturing.
. Accuracy and reliability of Earth observation data also depended on the performance of optical imaging instruments.
New materials such as fused silica glass, ultra-low expansion titanium silicate, and glass-ceramic, to name a few, as well as application of advanced glass coating techniques, could improve dramatically the capability and reliability of remote sensing instruments.
. The concept of small satellites and microsatellites and platforms had recently received considerable attention because of growing costs associated with "regular" scientific and Earth observation missions.
Low design and manufacturing costs, short construction periods, the low cost of launches and the availability of launchers, and opportunities to use updated technologies made such satellites very attractive to the scientific and educational communities, especially in developing countries.
A number of ongoing small satellite and microsatellite projects, including Central European satellite for advanced research (CESAR), joint ultraviolet night sky observer (JUNO) and Italian universities satellite (UNISAT), were discussed at the Conference.
A number of speakers at the Conference presented their experiences in applications of data derived from optical instruments installed on-board Earth observation satellites.
Those applications covered hazard assessment in tropical regions, environmental monitoring, water resource inventory and monitoring, atmospheric studies and meteorology.
National programmes and projects in applications of remote sensing data were also featured.

II. Agenda 10 INTRODUCTION
. The Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities was held at the United Nations Office at Vienna from 7 to 9 February 1996.
V. Kojarnovitch of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization was elected Chairman.
The list of participants is attached to the present report as annex I. .
On behalf of the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna, the Deputy to the Director-General, N. Jasentuliyana, opened the Meeting and welcomed the participants.
He noted that the United Nations system was called upon by the international community to carry out more activities with fewer resources in the areas of socio-economic development and humanitarian emergency assistance.
To demonstrate to the world its capacity to act as a force for improving social and economic conditions and for promoting global development and human prosperity, the United Nations system should direct its efforts towards implementing the action-oriented recommendations of the Secretary-General, as outlined by him in An Agenda for Peace 19951 and An Agenda for Development 1995,2 as well as those of recent major international conferences.
Those efforts should produce tangible progress towards the defined goals of development.
Space technology was one of the most promising tools available for giving effect to the recommendations on development, particularly those made by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992.
The Secretary-General had also stressed the importance of inter-agency coordination in development activities.
Efforts should therefore be made to identify key areas for inter-agency cooperation and coordination in space activities, and to develop practical schemes that would lead to tangible improvements in living conditions.
. The Meeting adopted the agenda contained in annex II of the present report.
I. SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE MEETING
B. Coordination of plans and programmes and exchange of views on current activities in the practical applications of space technology and related areas (agenda item 5)
1. Discussion of current and future plans of common interest, including consideration of the actual activities of United Nations organizations in the area of space science and technology and
its applications as they relate to their mandated programmes (agenda item 5 (a))
. It was decided to consider agenda items 4 and 5 (a) above together.
. The Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and the Expert on Space Applications informed the Meeting of the progress made by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees in implementing the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), and of other matters of inter-agency interest.
. The Meeting noted the progress made through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications in the establishment of the proposed regional centres for space science and technology education in the regions of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia.
The Meeting also noted that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27 of 7 November 1995, had endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that those centres should be established on the basis of affiliation to the United Nations as early as possible.
The Meeting was informed that the inauguration ceremony of the Regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the region of Asia and the Pacific had taken place in India on 1 November 1995, and that negotiations were under way with the Governments concerned in the other regions towards the establishment of other centres in the near future.
. The Meeting recognized the value of the concept of the above-mentioned regional centres, and commended the Office for Outer Space Affairs for its efforts in support of the initiative.
Some representatives expressed their wish to participate in the programmes, and offered to share their experience in the establishment of similar centres in their areas of competence.
Following a presentation by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, several representatives made substantive comments on the model curricula for the centres, which had been prepared to provide each centre with a benchmark of the academic level necessary for international recognition.
. The representatives of the organizations reported on their current activities and plans for 1996, 1997 and beyond.
They noted that they were continuing to implement the relevant recommendations of UNISPACE 82 (A/CONF.101/10), mostly as part of ongoing programmes.
In that connection, an exchange of views followed regarding how best to coordinate future activities. .
The Meeting noted that the Economic Commission for Africa, through the activities of its regional remote sensing centres, and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, through the steps taken to implement the recommendations of the Ministerial Conference on Space Applications for Development in Asia and the Pacific, held at Beijing in September 1994, had been successfully addressing the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
The Meeting further recognized that the regional commissions had an important role to play in assisting in the harmonization and coordination of the space-related activities of centres at the regional level.
. The Meeting concluded that efforts should continue to be focused on the identification of areas where the interests of different agencies coincided, and where coordinated actions could be undertaken.
The Meeting also noted with appreciation the strong emphasis given by the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, and by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, to the importance of cooperation between organizations in the United Nations system, and agreed to keep the Committee informed of the progress made in their activities.
The Meeting further stressed the importance of continued cooperation and coordination between the organizations in the United Nations system that pursued activities relating to outer space, and that were represented at the Meeting.
The Meeting reiterated its agreement that through the inter-agency process, ways and means should be found to advance the views of each organization at the conferences of other organizations.
In that connection, it was observed that each organization should continue the useful practice of apprising its member States of the important issues that should be followed up by those member States in other forums.
2. Consideration of matters to be included in the report of the Secretary-General
on the programmes of work of United Nations organizations (agenda item 5 (b))
. The Meeting had before it the draft annual report of the Secretary-General entitled "Coordination of outer space activities within the United Nations system: programme of work for 1996, 1997 and future years".
It was the twenty-first report to be submitted to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, in which information from organizations in the United Nations system was presented in an integrated form, and planned activities were outlined by field of applications.
. The Meeting noted that, in accordance with the agreement reached by the Administrative Committee on Coordination during its annual session in 1984 (ACC/1984/PG/8, para. 13), the draft report currently consisted of two major sections: one containing a summary of major planned activities and programmes, without reference to the organizations concerned; and the other containing a description of the future programmes of the individual organizations concerned.
. The draft report contained information on activities and programmes involving the applications of space technology in the fields of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), communications and navigation, meteorology and hydrology, basic space science, safety aspects and other related fields.
It highlighted activities carried out jointly by the organizations concerned through cooperative programmes, and included those carried out separately within their areas of competence.
Those activities included, for the above-mentioned fields: assistance in education and training through training courses, workshops, seminars and fellowships; expert services and survey missions to the countries concerned and conduct of studies on pilot projects or implementation of projects with operational applications of technology; and dissemination or exchange of information on the status of technology or operational systems.
The Meeting noted that the planned activities reflected the efforts of organizations to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
. The draft report was discussed in detail, and a number of suggestions and comments were made.
The Meeting adopted the report, on the understanding that the changes agreed upon would be incorporated in the final text, to be submitted by the Secretary-General in document A/AC.105/631 to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session, to be held from 12 to 23 February 1996.
C. In-depth review of the cooperation of United Nations organizations in remote sensing and related GIS activities: remote sensing data policy for requirements of the organizations of the United Nations system and implementation of the recommendations of Agenda 21 (agenda item 6)
. In its consideration of the item, the Meeting addressed a number of issues, and made a brief evaluation of activities supported in developing countries by organizations in the United Nations system.
The Meeting focused on what the emphasis of such support should be in the future.
Issues addressed in that context included: conferences, workshops and seminars on the applications of new and advanced systems; training and education programmes; institution-building; project formulation and execution; exchange of information; and other areas of inter-agency cooperation.
. The Meeting noted that there were many areas that needed close attention.
It recalled that at its previous session, it had discussed in detail the policy adopted by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) of charging a fee for access to direct read-out Meteosat high- resolution imager (HRI) data.
It also recalled, first, its recommendation that the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee might wish to consider the implications of that matter, and make its views known to EUMETSAT, and, secondly, its agreement that concerned organizations in the United Nations system should pursue the matter through their respective heads.
. The Meeting noted that the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, at its thirty-second session in 1995, had recognized the need for continuing free access to data from operational meteorological satellites.
It further noted that the Committee, at its thirty-eighth session in 1995, had once again stressed the need for the international community to utilize remote sensing data in an effort to fully implement the recommendations contained in Agenda 21,3 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and had recognized the example of international cooperation displayed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) through the exchange of meteorological data as provided for in resolution 11.4/1 adopted by the twelfth World Meteorological Congress of WMO on 21 June 1995.
. The Meeting was informed that, as of September 1995, EUMETSAT had commenced implementation of the policy of charging a fee for access to direct read-out Meteosat HRI data.
It was further informed that those countries with a per capita gross national product of more than 2,000 United States dollars per year would be subject to an annual fee of 80,000 European Currency Units for data access.
The Meeting noted with concern the recent decision of EUMETSAT to consider activities of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in connection with the African Real-Time Environmental Monitoring using Imaging Satellites (ARTEMIS) project as commercial, and therefore subject to a higher annual fee.
. The Meeting voiced deep concern that such a policy of charging a fee for access to satellite data, if applied to other organizations in the United Nations system or if followed by other satellite operators, could severely limit the capability of developing countries and organizations in the United Nations system to carry out space activities.
. The Meeting agreed that since WMO was the only organization in the United Nations system invited as an observer to attend meetings of EUMETSAT, the highest-ranking officials of other organizations in the United Nations system should inform the Secretary-General of WMO of their contacts with EUMETSAT.
It also agreed that every effort should be made to document all projects in which United Nations bodies assisted national meteorological services of their member States, and to ensure that EUMETSAT and WMO were made aware of such projects.
. The Meeting agreed that in its deliberations on matters relating to remote sensing, several important points had been identified for discussion at future meetings.
It was noted that discussions should continue on those points and other selected issues because, unlike other emerging areas of technology, such as space manufacturing, the benefits of which were not yet apparent as far as developing countries were concerned, remote sensing was definitely an important tool for those countries.
. The Meeting took note of the need for further inter-agency consultation on, and coordination of, the activities and programmes of the organizations in the United Nations system, particularly in view of the follow-up activities to be undertaken in response to Agenda 21.
The Meeting agreed that the in-depth review of the cooperation of organizations in the United Nations system in remote sensing and related GIS activities should be continued at its next session.
. The Meeting was informed of the progress made in the discussions conducted on a third UNISPACE conference by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and by the Committee during their sessions in 1995.
It had before it document A/AC.105/575/Add.1, which had been submitted to the Subcommittee, and document A/AC.105/1995/CRP.7, which had been submitted to the Committee.
. The Meeting noted the agreement by the Committee and subsequently by the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, that a third UNISPACE conference could be held before the turn of the century.
The Meeting took note of the recommendation of the Committee that the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, at its thirty-third session in 1996, should aim at completing its work on developing and refining a framework that would make it possible to consider every means of achieving the desired ends, as well as to evaluate proposals made by the Committee at its thirty-ninth session in the same year.
It further noted that, on the basis of the work of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, the Committee would consider all issues relating to the possible holding of a third UNISPACE conference, including other means of achieving the objectives of the conference, with a view to making a final decision on the matter at its session in 1996.
. The Meeting agreed that an important matter that should be dealt with by the proposed conference was the protection of intellectual property such as inventions and databases relating to activities in outer space, including direct transnational satellite broadcasting.
. The Meeting expressed the hope that in scheduling an eventual third UNISPACE conference, due consideration would be given to the calendar of major activities planned by organizations in the United Nations system.
II. CONSIDERATION OF AN INTER-AGENCY SPACE APPLICATIONS PROJECT
. The Meeting noted that the Secretary-General in An Agenda for Development 1995 had emphasized the importance of operational coordination within the United Nations system for development activities in order to achieve the benefits of a unified system, while preserving the strength of the current approach.
It also noted that the Secretary-General had listed several objectives to be attained, including the strengthening of United Nations capabilities in the linking of emergency relief and development and in the promotion of preventive and curative development.
. The Meeting recognized the potential contribution of space technology to socio-economic development, particularly in the area of disaster prevention, warning and relief.
In that connection, the Meeting noted with interest the project proposal by the Office for Outer Space Affairs regarding disaster warning for small island developing states.
The Meeting reviewed the proposal in detail, and agreed that it should be submitted to other organizations involved in related activities for their consideration and comments, in particular the secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.
Some representatives suggested that a volunteer working group might be established to review the feedback from those other organizations and to refine the concept of the project when the proposal had further evolved.
. The Meeting further noted the initiatives of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications in implementing the project entitled "Cooperative information network linking scientists, educators, professionals and decision makers in Africa" (COPINE), which would establish an information network linking institutions in Africa and institutions in Europe through the use of communication satellites.
The participants exchanged views and made several comments on the COPINE project.
III. OTHER MATTERS
. The Meeting discussed various means of better coordinating its work, especially through the use of new technologies.
The Internet and its various services, including electronic mail, the File Transfer Protocol, name lists and the World Wide Web (WWW), were identified as highly useful for achieving that purpose.
Various agencies informed the Meeting of already existing home pages on WWW.
The Meeting agreed that the use of the Internet should be further expanded as a means of strengthening inter-agency coordination, and requested the Office for Outer Space Affairs to determine whether such an expanded service could be ensured, and to act as its central coordinator.
. The Meeting agreed that the Office for Outer Space Affairs could serve as a coordinating node for accessing space-related information of agencies in the United Nations system.
For that purpose, it further agreed that the home page of the Office for Outer Space Affairs should contain pointers to access the home pages of other agencies.
To that end, the Meeting suggested that interested participating agencies should provide their WWW addresses for inclusion in the home page of the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
. The Meeting noted with satisfaction that additional artifacts had been contributed to the permanent Exhibit on International Cooperation in Utilizing the Benefits of Space Technology for Improving Life on Earth and for Protecting the Environment, which was housed at the United Nations Office at Vienna.
It further noted that the work of several organizations in the United Nations system were reflected in the Exhibit.
IV. FUTURE PROGRAMME OF WORK
. The Meeting reiterated the importance of continuing its meetings on an annual basis, in order to better coordinate activities relating to outer space within the United Nations system.
Various intergovernmental committees, particularly the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, had expressed concern about the duplication of efforts in the work of various organizations in the United Nations system.
In that connection, the Meeting noted that its own work had helped to allay those concerns, and that the committees had commended its work in their recent reports.
. The Meeting, noting the recommendation of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee concerning the necessity of ensuring continuous and effective consultations and coordination in the field of outer space activities between organizations in the United Nations system and of avoiding duplication of activities (A/AC.105/605, para. 38), agreed that the present report should be brought to the attention of the Subcommittee.
. The Meeting considered the need for further inter-agency consultation on, and coordination of, the activities and programmes of the organizations in the United Nations system, particularly in view of the implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 and the follow-up activities to be undertaken in response to Agenda 21.
It was therefore agreed that the provisional agenda of the next Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities should include the following major items on its provisional agenda:
1. Implementation of the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
2. Coordination of plans and programmes and exchange of views on current activities in the practical application of space technology and related areas:
(a) Discussion of current and future plans of common interest, including consideration of the actual activities of United Nations organizations in the area of space science and technology and its applications as they relate to their mandated programmes;
(b) Consideration of matters to be included in the report of the Secretary-General on the programme of work of United Nations organizations.
3. In-depth review of the cooperation of United Nations organizations in remote sensing and related GIS activities: remote sensing data policy for requirements of the organizations of the United Nations system and implementation of the recommendations of Agenda 21.
4. Review of progress on the proposed inter-agency space applications project for disaster prevention, mitigation and relief.
5. Inter-agency coordination in matters relating to the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
6. Enhancement of coordination among the organizations within the United Nations system through the use of advanced information technologies.
7. Other matters.
. The Meeting agreed that it should continue its in-depth review of cooperation between United Nations organizations in some specific areas of space applications, such as remote sensing, communications, navigation, meteorology and related technology transfer, education, intellectual property and spin-off benefits, in order to ensure that the activities of the United Nations system in those areas should be suitably integrated and that the services rendered to Member States should fully meet their requirements in an efficient and cost-effective manner. .
Since interested agencies would be represented at meetings of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the Meeting agreed that its future sessions should be convened at Vienna in June in conjunction with the annual sessions of the Committee.
That agreement was made without prejudice to any invitation by an interested agency to host a future session at its headquarters.
. The Meeting expressed its disappointment that some of the organizations in the United Nations system that were active in space activities and had been invited to participate were not present at the current session.
It noted that several organizations had been unable to participate because of financial restrictions.
Nevertheless, recognizing the importance of its work, the Meeting urged all concerned organizations in the United Nations system to actively participate in its future sessions.
. The Meeting expressed its appreciation to the Chairman for the efficient manner in which he had guided the work of the Meeting, and thanked the Office for Outer Space Affairs for acting as host and providing secretariat support.

INTRODUCTION The present report has been prepared by the Secretary-General at the request of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and concerns efforts at coordinating the activities of organizations within the United Nations system that relate to assistance to developing countries in the practical applications of space technology.
The report is based on the contributions submitted by the organizations concerned in response to the United Nations request for information on concrete programmes of work envisaged primarily for 1996 and 1997, and was reviewed in its draft form at the Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities, held at Vienna from 7 to 9 February 1996.
The report consists of three sections.
Section I contains a list of the participants in outer space activities within the United Nations system.
A matrix of outer space programmes is also provided to identify the activities of each participant in specific fields.
Section II presents a summary of major activities and programmes planned for 1996 and 1997 and future years by the organizations within the United Nations system as a whole.
Section III presents concrete activities or programmes planned by individual organizations in an integrated form under subsections on remote sensing and the Geographic Information System (GIS), communications and navigation, meteorology and hydrology, basic space science, safety aspects, and other activities in the field of space science and technology and its applications.
There are three headings - education and training programmes, expert services and survey missions, and dissemination or exchange of information - under each of the first three subsections in section III (remote sensing and GIS, communications and navigation, and meteorology and hydrology).
Concerning the last of those headings, more efforts are being made within the United Nations system to develop databases to disseminate information with increased accuracy, quantity and speed.
In the present report, activities related to the establishment or development of databases are categorized as studies on or implementation of pilot projects while those related to the operation of databases, after the development phase is completed, are categorized as dissemination or exchange of information.
Valuable information on space technology or on operational systems can also be disseminated at meetings or conferences where decision makers in space activities exchange their opinions and may elaborate strategies or plans for future activities.
Since the main purpose of such meetings or conferences is not to educate or train, they are also categorized as dissemination or exchange of information, rather than education and training programmes.
Under the subsection on remote sensing and GIS, there are two more headings, "Establishment of centres for space science and technology education" and "Capacity building", reflecting the increase in efforts to develop indigenous capability in space science and technology in developing countries.
Under the subsection on activities in the field of communications and navigation, there are two additional headings relating to the efforts in the United Nations system concerning legal aspects.
One concerns the regulation of the use of the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio-frequency spectrum allocated to space communication services.
The other heading concerns the efforts towards the establishment of new legal frameworks or the development of new technological systems to complement the existing legal frameworks.
NATIONS SYSTEM AND MATRIX OF OUTER SPACE PROGRAMMES
A matrix of outer space programmes within the United Nations system is presented below.
Organizations within the United Nations system have planned activities for 1996 and 1997 and future years within the fields of remote sensing and GIS, communications and navigation, meteorology and hydrology.
Valuable space-related or space-aided activities in basic space sciences, improvement of safety and other activities related to space science and technology and its applications will also be conducted by organizations within the United Nations system.
The planned activities range from education and training to operational applications of technologies.
Three categories of activities are notable in most of the above-mentioned fields of space activities.
The first category to be noted is the education and training programmes, which are generally offered by holding training courses, workshops and seminars or supporting fellowships.
Efforts are being made to improve the educational and training environment by establishing new facilities or providing educational tools.
Secondly, organizations within the United Nations system provide expert services and conduct survey missions to identify specific areas of applications relevant to a given country or group of countries.
Specific studies on pilot projects in a country or group of countries are also being conducted.
In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on maximizing the benefits from space activities for social and economic development through the operational applications of existing space technologies.
A number of projects with such emphasis are carried out at the local, regional or global level.
Thirdly, dissemination of information on the status of technology or on the operational systems has always been an important element in space activities.

In the field of remote sensing, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have planned a number of international, regional and national training courses and workshops.
They cover remote sensing applications in general as well as specialized topics such as sustainable development of natural resources and energy, natural resources and environment management, land-cover mapping and land-use planning.
Most of these international and regional training courses are jointly organized by two or more organizations within the United Nations system, often in cooperation with other international organizations and/or Governments.
Many of the organizations of the United Nations system offer expert services in their respective areas of competence and carry out pilot projects with the use of remote sensing technologies and GIS.
These technologies are applied to a wide range of activities, such as natural resources and environment monitoring, management and development, monitoring of natural resources and natural disasters, early warning for food security, land-cover mapping and land management, forest planning and management, mapping of desertification, monitoring of cultural sites and pest disease control.
In the area of dissemination of information, organizations either provide information upon request or issue recurrent or non-recurrent publications concerning technological status or existing operational systems to increase awareness of the useful applications of remote sensing technologies.
Reflecting the rapid expansion of the information superhighway with the use of computer networks, an increasing number of organizations are establishing databases that will tremendously increase the availability of data of interest for a larger number of computer users.
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies.
Further progress has been made towards the establishment of regional centres for space science and technology education with the cooperation of the Secretariat, regional commissions and other interested organizations within the United Nations system, after the completion of evaluation missions to Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and West Asia.
The centres for space science and technology education in Asia and the Pacific and in Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to become operational in the period 1996-1997.
There will be more activities within the United Nations system with the particular objective of capacity building in developing countries with the use of remote sensing and GIS technologies.
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development, natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping.
Especially within the framework of field projects, the development of human resources is considered an important factor.
In the field of communications and navigation, efforts are being made to organize a training course and workshops and to provide fellowship support.
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned, organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education, increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security.
Satellite communication systems are also considered a vital tool for social and economic development, as demonstrated by the Regional African Satellite Communications System (RASCOM) project.
The results or interim reports of the projects or studies conducted within the United Nations system are also available in the form of recurrent or non-recurrent publications or digitized data disseminated through computer networks.
Various studies are being carried out to examine the technical constraints associated with radio-frequency allocations and related provisions for space radiocommunications below 3 GHz with a view to facilitating the use of those frequency bands.
Efforts are also being made towards the establishment of new legal norms or the development of new technological systems to complement the existing legal framework.
Examples of such efforts are the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including copyright, and the development of a new system in the interest of international civil aviation.
The work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations is also making significant contributions in the area of applications of space technology for land, maritime and aeronautical mobile communications.
Studies on a worldwide radio-navigation system are being conducted within the United Nations system.
While the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) are regarded as candidates, consideration is also being given to a post-GPS/GLONASS system.
The application of satellite technology forms an important element of technical cooperation activities in both meteorology and operational hydrology.
A series of workshops, training courses and fellowship programmes are planned for 1996 and 1997 to discuss the subjects of satellite meteorology, tropical meteorology, hurricane forecasting, marine studies and watershed management, among many others.
Through the provision of expert services, efforts are made to develop a marine and coastal zone data information system, to improve management of water and coastal resources, to upgrade meteorological observations by installing data collection platforms and to improve the meteorological telecommunication system by planning the implementation of a regional meteorological telecommunication network in various regions.
Reflecting the increasing awareness of global changes, including climate change, organizations within the United Nations system also cooperate in global schemes, such as the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme.
A series of technical reports on climate research and ocean observations, as well as water-resource management, are also published.
In basic space sciences, workshops are being planned in the regions of Asia and the Pacific and of Europe for the period 1996-1997.
Selected presentations and lectures delivered at the workshops will be published on a yearly basis.
Furthermore, organizations within the United Nations system continue to collaborate with the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) to support space research activities of scientists from developing countries.
Organizations within the United Nations system also make efforts towards the improvement of safety in various human activities.
While studies are under way to apply space technology to establish safety systems, such as the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), consideration is given also to emerging risk and danger as a result of expanding space activities, such as the risk of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space.
Space technology can be a solution for safety in many aspects.
Conversely, space activities may create a risk which should be dealt with by various organizations.
The responsibility of the United Nations for social and economic development on Earth and the protection of the global environment is being emphasized more than ever.
The importance of coordination among the organizations within the United Nations system has been underscored in a number of studies carried out in recent years on the future of the United Nations system.
The importance and potential of space science and technology for the prosperity of the Earth and human beings are widely, although not sufficiently, recognized.
With high-level coordination among the organizations within the United Nations system in conducting outer space activities, space technology can have a positive impact on various aspects of human activities while contributing to the achievement of goals set within the United Nations system.
Since the Administrative Committee on Coordination established a subcommittee on outer space activities in 1975, inter-agency efforts to ensure cooperation among interested organizations in outer space have resulted in a number of projects involving two or more organizations.
As the United Nations system enters the third decade of such efforts, it is hoped that this report on the future space activities of the organizations within the United Nations system will lead to even more initiatives to plan and implement inter-agency outer space projects.

2. Expert services and survey missions to identify specific areas of applications relevant to a
given country or group of countries and to carry out specific studies on pilot projects
Provision of expert services and survey missions
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will continue to provide technical advisory services to the Government of Ecuador for promoting regional cooperation, administration and funding of the ground receiving station at Cotopaxi (A/AC.105/587, para. 47).
The Programme, in cooperation with the Department for Development Support and Management Services and ESA, will continue its efforts to identify and implement support mechanisms to enable scientists from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean to receive and utilize data from the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT), Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) and European remote sensing satellites (ERS) of ESA.
The Office for Outer Space Affairs continues to provide support to the Government of Chile, at the request of the latter, in its follow-up activities, as pro tempore secretariat, of the recommendations of the second Space Conference of the Americas, which was held at Santiago from 26 to 30 April 1993 (A/AC.105/551, para. 44).
At the request of the Government of Uruguay, which will host the third Space Conference of the Americas in 1996, the Office for Outer Space Affairs is prepared to provide any necessary support to the Government.
The Department for Development Support and Management Services continues to provide technical support to Member States to improve, among others, the planning and management of energy and natural resources, as well as operational cartographic activities related to the recommendations derived from Agenda 21.
For 1996 and 1997, the Department is planning activities through which GIS and land information system (LIS) technology will be disseminated to the international community through seminars and expert services, as well as technical advisory missions.
It is expected that the plan to decentralize the natural resource and energy programme, which was initiated by the Secretary-General, will be actually implemented in the biennium 1996-1997.
In accordance with the plan, the regional commissions will work jointly with Headquarters under a single and unique cooperative programme between the regional commissions and the Department for Development Support and Management Services.
In the light of the above, ECA expects that services to member States will continue to expand, as was the case for 1994 and 1995.
In 1996 and in future years, particular attention will be given to its sponsored regional training and service remote sensing centres, when new medium-term programmes will be initiated for both the Regional Centre for Training in Aerospace Surveys (RECTAS) and the Regional Centre for Services in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (RCSSMRS).
In this context, the proposals of ECA to reorient the functions and activities of the centres will be pursued in accordance with the results of the assessment in 1995 of the African remote sensing programmes and the real results achieved so far by the centres.
The harmonization and rationalization of ECA-sponsored regional institutions will continue to be a priority objective until a final decision is made on the future activities of the regional centres.
ECA progressive studies on the matter, presented at its Conference of Ministers of the Commission in 1992, 1993 and 1994, recommended the merging of some institutions and the conversion of others into specialized agencies of subregional economic communities.
It was recommended that RECTAS and the Ouagadougou Regional Remote Sensing Centre (CRTO) should be merged into one centre.
ESCAP will conduct consultative meetings with missions to donor agencies to arrange for cost-sharing and co-financing of regional GIS and remote sensing activities during 1996.
Each year, the FAO remote sensing, agrometeorology and GIS centre provides technical support, including advisory services, formulation, backstopping and evaluation of field projects, to about 50 developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and central and eastern Europe.
In addition, FAO provides support to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) for their field project activities.
FAO will continue to cooperate with the regional commissions and regional remote sensing centres in the efficient use of remote sensing technology for the mapping, assessment and monitoring of renewable natural resources and natural disasters.
The priorities of this assistance will follow the Agenda 21 recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.
FAO will continue its assistance to the Government of Afghanistan in preparing for the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector through an inventory of current land utilization based on satellite remote sensing and GIS technologies.
Such assistance will also be provided to Albania, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Pakistan.
FAO will implement phase II of its regional remote sensing/food security early warning project for the member States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) with funding by the Government of the Netherlands.
FAO will also continue its sister project for the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) with funding by the Government of France.
FAO will continue its assistance to countries in the Caribbean subregion in establishing LIS based on aerial photography, satellite remote sensing and orthophotomapping.
At present such assistance is being provided to Barbados, Belize and Trinidad and Tobago, and possibly to Guyana and Haiti.
FAO will continue to assist countries in central Europe in increasing their capacities for agricultural and environmental applications of remote sensing and GIS.
In particular, FAO will continue to offer advice on the use of remote sensing and GIS in planning and implementing agricultural land reform and in assessing and monitoring environmental damage.
At present, such assistance is being provided to Albania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
FAO continues to contribute, with the use of remote sensing technology, to the development of schemes to control pest diseases.
Earlier studies relating ARTEMIS normalized difference vegetation index data sets to tsetse fly distribution and land utilization types in Nigeria and Togo led to the establishment of an operational information system to define policies for African animal trypanosomiasis control.
Remote sensing is used to define technical concepts for tsetse control in countries where high resolution satellite images are available to discern land utilization types.
A project is currently being prepared to design maps and GIS to assist 11 western African countries affected by onchocerciasis.
In the field of agricultural statistics, FAO continues to assist approximately 10 developing countries in satellite imagery techniques, which can be used for geographical stratification (subdivision in homogenous land units), area sampling frame, regression estimate and area sampling surveys.
UNESCO, in cooperation with the Center for Remote Sensing of Boston University in the United States of America, will assist in 1996 the Omani authorities in establishing a GIS and a digital image-processing laboratory.
Study, pilot projects and operational applications
The Office for Outer Space Affairs and FAO continue to have discussions with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) to define possibilities for cooperation in the use of remote sensing technology by UNDCP.
The subjects of the discussions include the organization of expert meetings in 1996 and beyond regarding remote sensing and associated technologies to consider the use of satellite data for detecting and monitoring narcotic crops, monitoring alternative development projects and crop substitution activities, and determining environmental damage due to narcotic planting, processing and distribution.
Projects are being conducted by FAO in Afghanistan, Colombia and Lebanon.
Plans are also being made for an expert consultation (see paragraph 93 below).
In a holistic study initiated by UNDCP and undertaken by the FAO Remote Sensing Centre, an attempt will be made to determine the potential role of remote sensing technologies for gathering inventory on and monitoring the extent of illicit crop cultivation.
The study is expected to lay the foundation for a workshop in early 1996 to discuss the technical feasibility and operational requirements of programmes for the application of remote sensing technologies for the above-mentioned purposes.
Remote sensing projects of this sort are being considered for Lebanon and Myanmar and could be extended elsewhere if the technology proves effective.
Those activities are being coordinated by the Division for Operational Activities and Technical Services of UNDCP.
The Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat continues to promote and direct activities of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-1999) (General Assembly resolution 44/236 of 22 December 1989) through the secretariat of the Decade.
As a part of the activities for the Decade, special attention has been directed towards using remote sensing and space technology monitoring and reducing the impact of natural disasters. Several projects for the Decade developed by Governments and specialized agencies are aimed at improving the use of satellite monitoring and communication systems so as to widen their actual geographic coverage and to enhance the dissemination of effective warnings in case of disaster.
As a part of the above-mentioned activities, the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, organized by the secretariat of the Decade, was held at Yokohama, Japan, from 23 to 27 May 1994.
The Conference adopted the Yokohama Strategy for a Safer World: Guidelines for Natural Disaster Prevention, Preparedness and Mitigation, and its Plan of Action, in which it requested the United Nations, through the secretariat of the Decade, to provide Governments, upon request, with technical assistance in the preparation and development of disaster management plans and programmes.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Geneva, continues to work closely with the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the secretariat of the Decade in the development of Global Information Systems on Natural Hazards (GISNH) for that facility, in order to ensure that the results are useful for natural hazard research and operational applications.
GISNH is a "meta-database" of natural hazard databases established worldwide at various agencies and organizations.
It allows the user to search for and obtain a wealth of information on historical occurrences of natural hazards for application on a global, regional or local scale.
GISNH is also a contribution of the GRID facility at Geneva to the on-line HazardNet project of the Decade and Simon Fraser University at Vancouver, Canada.
Environmental monitoring at the global, regional, national and local levels requires new and innovative approaches to the analysis of multi-course, multi-scale and multi-temporal spatial data sets.
There is a constant, pressing need for establishing a base of scientifically proven analysis techniques to support environmental sensing using remotely sensed data.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Sioux Falls, South Dakota (United States), will continue its cooperation with scientists of the Earth Resources Observation System Data Center in the development of algorithms and techniques for change detection using remotely sensed data in support of operational programme needs.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Sioux Falls, is collaborating with the United States Geological Survey in the development of a global land cover characteristic database using advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data (with 1 km resolution) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellite.
This will also include other ancillary information such as data on elevation, eco-regions, climate and soils.
The tasks involved are AVHRR time series data assembly, ancillary data collection, interpretation, validation and evaluation, and product generation.
The land cover classification for North America is complete and the one for South America was scheduled to be completed by late 1995.
The global database will be completed in 1997.
The land cover characteristics database is designed for a wide variety of environmental and sustainable development applications.
Operational uses of the data include weather forecasting, fire danger modelling, air pollution assessments and crop condition analysis.
The land cover classification for North America is being used by the North America Commission on Environmental Cooperation for continental reporting on the state of the environment.
In addition, experimental work has demonstrated the utility of this data set for carbon stock inventories and other types of land process modelling.
Several other agencies of the United States, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Environmental Protection Agency and the forest service, are also cooperating in this project.
UNEP, through the GRID facilities at Bangkok and S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, will continue to contribute to an effort similar to the one mentioned above.
The UNEP contribution will also include, depending on the availability of funds, establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national, continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies.
There will be possibilities for experts from developing countries to participate in database development by working at the GRID facility at Sioux Falls for periods ranging from six months to one year.
The development of an appropriate statistical sampling strategy for validation of results will also be continued.
UNEP, through its Environment Assessment Programme for Asia and the Pacific, is engaged in the macro-scale land-cover assessment and monitoring of selected countries in the region using AVHRR data.
Land-cover mapping for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal and Viet Nam for the periods 1985-1986 and 1992-1993 was completed in 1994.
Data for Pakistan and Sri Lanka are currently being processed and analysed.
Negotiations are under way with China, India, Indonesia and Iran (Islamic Republic of) for possible extension of the project to those countries.
Two "hot spots" (major disturbance fronts), one in the northern part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the other at the Mekong delta in Viet Nam, have been identified for further investigation using high-resolution data from LANDSAT thematic mapper and SPOT.
Meteorological guidelines on the use of AVHRR data for the assessment and monitoring of major land-cover types in the region are being developed.
Those activities are expected to continue in 1996 and beyond.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Sioux Falls, will continue in the period 1995-1996 to contribute towards the further development of algorithms and techniques for the automatic identification and extraction of various phenologically indicative parameters from time series AVHRR (with 1 km resolution) normalized difference vegetation index composites.
Through its Desertification Control Programme, which was carried out in association with Institut g√©ographique national - France international (IGN-FI) for the period 1987-1992 (A/AC.105/587, para. 78), UNEP will continue to implement the following projects in 1996 using remotely sensed data: (a) national land degradation assessment and mapping in Kenya (in collaboration with the Governments of Kenya and the Netherlands); and (b) qualitative and quantitative assessment and mapping of desertification in two countries in the ESCAP region (in collaboration with Governments and ESCAP).
UNEP and UNESCO will continue cooperation with the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in 1996.
UNEP, through its Environment Assessment Programme (EAP), will continue the Soils and Terrain (SOTER) database activities throughout 1996.
A joint GEMS and FAO activity involves the development of a SOTER database on the scale 1:5,000,000 for Latin America, which is implemented by the International Soils Reference and Information Centre.
UNEP, through its EAP, including GEMS and GRID, will continue to contribute to the work of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) as an affiliate.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Sioux Falls, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, will expand the coherent high-resolution 30-arc-second global, digital elevation data set, the work for which was initiated in 1994.
The work on Africa and North America is complete, and data sets on Africa were made available in 1995 on the World Wide Web homepage of the GRID facility at Sioux Falls.
UNEP, through the GRID facility at Arendal, Norway, will initiate in 1996 the development of an environmental atlas for the Barents region.
A wilderness map for the region and an operational pilot database containing selected geographical data sets have been completed.
There are plans to develop by 1997 a pilot version of a GIS-based environmental atlas for the Barents region.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Arendal, is supporting a pilot study to establish the methods and organizational framework for the implementation of an extensive Arctic environmental database for Asia and Europe.
In addition, the pilot study will, in 1996 and beyond, lead to the establishment of a database containing high-priority GIS data and an extensive reference database.
UNEP cooperation with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) at Cambridge, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, will continue in 1996 and beyond.
Through its GRID facility at Geneva, UNEP, in consultation with WCMC, the European Forest Institute at Joensuu, Finland, and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission at Ispra, Italy, has completed the first version of a European survey of forest and other maps possessed by international, regional and national agencies in both analog and digital format, including those obtained by space-based means.
The results have been incorporated in an on-line database product, and the first printed version was to be distributed in September 1995 to all survey participants and other interested parties.
The database will also be made available as a diskette product, and updates will continue to be incorporated in the database in 1996.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Geneva and its joint environment unit with the Department of Humanitarian Affairs is examining the feasibility of a pilot study on the applicability of space-based data for emergency response.
The study would follow at least one environmental catastrophe, chemical or oil spill, forest fire, manufacturing plant explosion or a natural disaster, which could be analysed using satellite imagery.
Which catastrophe would be covered by the study has not yet been determined.
The purpose of the study would be to determine the practicality of the use of space-acquired data for operational purposes, as well as to strengthen cooperation among United Nations agencies in an emergency response situation.
UNEP, through a project managed by its GRID facility at Arendal, is assisting the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in the application of GIS technology in agricultural research management.
Cooperative links between UNEP and the international agricultural research centres of the Consultative Group are being forged to integrate natural resources and socio-economic data and information into agricultural research activities in a more effective manner.
Project activities include (a) strengthening the network between the research centres and GRID facilities; (b) holding workshops to consider Consultative Group needs and refinement of project implementation strategy; (c) GIS technology transfer among the research centres and GRID nodes; and (d) identification of, access to, and/or generation of priority data sets for agricultural research, such as climate, population and soil databases on suitable scales.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Arendal, will cooperate with its partner organizations in increasing the utility and reliability of the Digital Chart of the World for GIS applications by conducting quantitative assessments of its reliability and accuracy in selected areas of interest.
The results will be coupled with feedback on the experiences of users in those areas.
ECA will undertake in the biennium 1996-1997 the following studies and projects:
(a) Study on mapping and LIS as the foundation for sustainable development of resources;
(b) Study on the status of natural resources and environmental baseline information in Africa with emphasis on the role of the private sector;
(c) The third and fourth phases of the Digital Cartographic Inventory Atlas project;
(d) The production of the first phase of a digital atlas on natural resources and energy in Africa.
In the period 1996-1997, ESCAP will continue or will start the following pilot projects in its region as collaborative projects to promote and customize remote sensing and GIS operational use in natural resources and environment monitoring:
(a) Pilot project on remote sensing in support of the implementation of Agenda 21 in the subregion of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN);
(b) Integrated study on sustainable development in arid zone;
(c) Coastal zone development and environment monitoring using integrated GIS and remote sensing technology.
FAO and ESA will continue their cooperation in developing appropriate techniques for the application of satellite synthetic aperture radar imagery to agriculture and forestry in developing countries.
Similar cooperation has started between FAO and the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing.
A pilot study on the use of ERS-1 and ERS-2 data for land-cover mapping in Africa is in progress.
FAO is continuing cooperation with the Government of France in developing operational methodologies for applications of high-resolution remote sensing data in international development projects through the implementation of pilot studies.
The results are published in the FAO Remote Sensing Centre series of technical publications and brochures for decision makers.
In addition, the Government of France is supporting FAO in the field of standardization and harmonization of methodologies on the use of remote sensing and GIS techniques.
The feasibility study on a global operational forest-cover monitoring network based on satellite remote sensing, which was conducted by FAO in cooperation with the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) of the Netherlands and the Agricultural University of Wageningen, will be followed by other feasibility studies as required by the global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) project of FAO in 1990.
The 1990 FRA project, a survey of pan-tropical resources, demonstrated that information on changes in forest and land use can be obtained on a global basis in a cost-effective, timely and statistically sound manner.
FAO concluded that such surveys, if continued over time, would lend factual support to global environmental researchers and policy makers by providing detailed descriptions of the processes of change and the quantification of essential parameters on a reliable basis.
In view of the international community's information needs, in particular, for studies on global change, FAO intends to continue to build consistent and reliable time series observations of forest and land use.
