75. Since the international community had failed to come up with an effective development-oriented strategy, the debt had reached unsustainable levels for some countries.
The situation was the same with regard to market access, since the access of the poorest countries to markets had not improved following the signing of the Uruguay Round agreements.
On the contrary, many developing countries were likely to suffer as a result of the removal of the Generalized System of Preferences, the increase in disguised protectionist measures and in world prices for some foodstuffs, imported textiles and clothing.
76. Consequently, in her delegation's view both the Declaration and the Strategy had not been implemented.
While most developing countries had been reforming their economies, the external environment had not been supportive of their development efforts.
International cooperation should be strengthened and the measures adopted by the recent major conferences, which aimed at achieving development within the larger context of peace and security, should be fully implemented.
Indeed, international peace and security could neither be achieved nor maintained in the absence of development.
The ongoing reforms in the Eastern European countries and in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States contributed to promoting that process.
78. As the Secretary-General had noted in his report on the integration of the economies in transition into the world economy (A/51/285), despite the continuing and severe problems, there had been a marked improvement in macroeconomic performance in recent years.
79. Many United Nations agencies made substantial contributions to the economic development of the countries in transition in various forms such as financial support, technical assistance, coordination and personnel training.
80. Georgia was facing specific obstacles in its efforts to transform the economy as a result of the conflict in the Abkhazian region.
Despite those difficulties, his Government was determined to press ahead with the implementation of its economic stabilization programme and with plans to balance public finances.
81. The United Nations agencies had an extremely important role to play in the macroeconomic stabilization process and structural reforms pursued by the countries in transition, and their support could only facilitate the integration of those countries into the world economy.
82. Mr. MODOUX (Director of the Communication Division of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) introduced the report of the sixth Interagency Round Table, which had taken place in Harare, Zimbabwe, in September 1996.
The meeting had enabled participants to share information and concrete experiences, explore common strategies and identify mechanisms to improve communications for development experiences among key actors in development, with emphasis on southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe.
83. The Round Table had focused on communication for development at the grass-roots and community level, in particular, communication techniques, methods and technologies to increase people's participation and catalyse the creation and sharing of knowledge and skills.
Like President Konare of Mali, participants in the meeting had asserted that it was only through participatory communication, namely, open, two-way communication that fostered dialogue, that communities could speak out and participate in the decisions that concerned their development.
Participatory communication also sought to change attitudes and behaviour in order to empower the people and strengthen the democratic process so that, in the long run, the development agenda could be set and implemented by the people.
84. The Round Table had noted that the effective use of communication for development depended on several factors: the integration of communication as a component in every development project or programme; the formulation of national policies, strategies and programmes for building or enhancing communication for development capacities and structures; national and local human capacity-building and training in the use of communication and information technologies; the establishment of national coordination mechanisms for communication for development activities; increased access to communication media, for women, young people, people living in rural communities and disadvantaged sections of urban areas; research, evaluation and assessment.
85. Bearing in mind those factors, participants in the Round Table had addressed recommendations to various actors in development, Governments, international organizations, bilateral donors and others. They had recommended that: the communication for development component should be included in the programmes of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa through appropriate funding; development and donor partners should ensure the long-term viability of their projects by establishing management and financial plans designed to generate income and ensure the sustainability and independence of such projects; specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations, and in-country institutions should contribute towards the development of rural radio and community radio through the formulation of an appropriate legal framework; low-cost broadcasting technologies and low-cost radio receivers should be used; Governments, development institutions and other partners should increase their efforts to build capacities in the use of new information and communication technologies for development in Africa.
The Round Table had also recommended that financing should be identified to ensure the sharing of the experiences of the Federation of African Media Women of Zimbabwe in contacting rural communities, in mobilizing women to enhance their role in development and in training people to use technical equipment and make their own radio programmes; that countries should be encouraged and assisted to build the appropriate capacities and institutions at the local and national levels; that the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Governments of the region should continue to promote the services of the SADC Centre for Communication for Development; that specialized agencies, governmental and non-governmental organizations should share methodologies and the results of research work and collaborate whenever feasible; and, lastly, that all agencies should support communication programmes aimed at making the recommendations of United Nations conferences more widely known and contributing to their implementation.
86. Mrs. RADUCHOWSKA-BROCHWICZ (Poland) said that the increasing globalization and liberalization of the world economy made it necessary for developing countries and countries with economies in transition to adapt their economies to new circumstances while introducing reforms needed in order to achieve sustainable, human-centred development.
87. Notwithstanding the emergence of positive trends in the economies of many countries, dramatic variations between regions persisted.
The international community should strive to reduce those disparities by focusing first on those in greatest need.
Efforts to bring about more equitable growth also should take into account other key components of sustainable development, including its social and environmental aspects and the gender perspective.
88. The developing countries and the countries with economies in transition had made some progress in recent years towards the establishment of a market economy; for example, prices had been liberalized, most currencies were convertible, inflation had been reduced, shortages had been eliminated and the private sector played a greater role.
New international business practices and standards had been adopted.
Nevertheless, many problems continued to hamper the full integration of those countries into the world economy.
For example, their banks and other financial institutions required strengthening and large State enterprises should be privatized as a matter of priority; it also was necessary to create social safety nets and fully involve women in the reform process.
Accordingly the international community should continue to assist the countries with economies in transition to establish a market economy and achieve sustainable and balanced development.
It should be noted in that connection that many United Nations bodies provided very useful assistance in those areas.
89. Mr. MARRERO (United States of America) said that the private sector was the primary engine of economic development.
The key to growth was the creation of the necessary conditions to foster private sector investment, including the development of human resources and environmental protection.
In that process, the State must avoid any action which might be harmful to development fostered by the private sector, provide economic incentives where appropriate and combat abuses.
90. Official development assistance and multilateral lending were most effective when they promoted private sector participation.
Sound fiscal and monetary policy, free trade, currency convertibility and straightforward procedures for the creation of businesses were the best ways to achieve sustainable growth, at any stage of a nation's development.
The attainment of that objective required good governance, which could be defined as government that was honest, open and equitable, that provided public institutions which were stable, responsive and reliable and that was transparent, representative, accountable and restrained.
For the same reasons that it was necessary to promote the values of good governance, it also was necessary to highlight the evils which threatened it, namely, corruption and related illicit practices.
There was growing awareness in the international community that corruption undermined good governance and the effective use of scarce aid resources.
As Mr. Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank, had stated, corruption was a "cancer" that formed a major barrier to sound and equitable development.
Corruption in any form must not be tolerated.
91. Corruption threatened good governance not only because it spread the social corrosion of crime, but also, because it exacted devastating economic, environmental and political consequences.
It distorted markets and hindered economic development, enriching a few at the expense of many.
Corruption could degrade the environment and endanger public safety.
In short, corruption constituted a multifaceted menace to society and its development.
92. The battle against that scourge therefore must be waged at all levels, international, national and local.
It must enlist all countries and all segments of society - government, private enterprises and non-governmental organizations.
It was time that the United Nations, too, paid greater attention to the challenge of corruption.
The adoption of the draft United Nations declaration against corruption and bribery in international commercial transactions would be a first essential step to that end; the credibility of the economic dialogue under way in the General Assembly demanded nothing less.
The matter currently was under discussion in the Economic and Social Council.
Just as Member States had in the past insisted on social and economic development and environmental protection, so they must now demand that good governance be recognized as part of the development consensus.
93. Mr. PAPIAN (Armenia) said that the special situation of the countries with economies in transition merited a specific analysis by the organizations of the United Nations.
There was no question that the integration of those countries into the world economy and their involvement in the work of multilateral institutions would have a very positive impact on the global economy.
94. Armenia's strategy for economic reform involved three main elements: macroeconomic stabilization, economic liberalization and the privatization of State-owned assets.
Notwithstanding a number of obstacles which it had encountered, Armenia had achieved a fair degree of economic stability and an increase in output.
The Government maintained the necessary fiscal and monetary discipline and endeavoured to rationalize social expenditure while protecting those in greatest need.
95. The presence of the United Nations specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions in Armenia clearly enhanced the durability of the transition process. However, the integrated approach taken by the United Nations system should be strengthened through the country strategy notes and the resident coordinator system.
By using each country's indigenous knowledge and available international expertise, it would be possible to enhance the effectiveness of measures adopted.
The meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.

1. Mr. GUTIERREZ (Costa Rica), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that, following the meeting of Ambassadors held on 27 November 1996, the Group had deemed it necessary to change its previous position regarding the use of the expression "within the existing resources" or other similar expressions in the resolutions of the Second Committee.
The Group believed that by wondering whether or not to use such expressions, the Committee would in fact be encroaching upon the prerogatives of the Fifth Committee, which was primarily responsible for the consideration of the financial aspects of all programmes and the budgetary implications of any of the Main Committees' resolutions.
In that regard, the Group drew the Committee's attention to the letter from the Chairman of the Fifth Committee addressed to the Chairman of the Second Committee (A/C.2/51/9), which in fact recalled that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters.
The Chairman of the Fifth Committee requested therefore that the Second Committee should leave aside any financial aspects when considering drafts, so that the Fifth Committee could take the appropriate action.
Given the Fifth Committee's priority in that matter, the Group of 77 and China wished to eliminate the use of the expression in question. If necessary, there should be a vote on the relevant paragraphs of the resolutions introduced.
(b) FINANCING OF DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING NET TRANSFER OF RESOURCES BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (continued)
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.26 and L.53: Net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries
2. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.53, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.26.
As the draft had met with general approval, he hoped that the Committee would adopt it by consensus.
3. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.53 was adopted.
4. Ms. LEBL (United States of America) expressed her delegation's reservations concerning the tenth preambular paragraph of the proposed resolution.
She reaffirmed that the United States understood that the expression "sustained economic growth" as it appeared in the resolutions referred to growth within the framework of sustainable development, as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and maintained by the heads of State and Government of more than 130 countries during the World Summit for Social Development.
The entire paragraph in question read:
"We are deeply convinced that economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development, which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people.
Equitable social development that recognizes empowering the poor to utilize environmental resources sustainably is a necessary foundation for sustainable development.
Her delegation was not in a position to accept the objectives in paragraph 3 of the draft concerning official development assistance.
She requested that her statement should be fully reflected in the summary record of the meeting.
5. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.26 was withdrawn.
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.28 and L.50: Global financial integration and strengthening collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions
6. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.50, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.28.
He noted that, in the first line of the fourth preambular paragraph, "section VIII" should be replaced by "section VII".
7. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.50, as orally revised, was adopted.
8. Mr. FLORENCIO (Brazil) said that he had coordinated the negotiations on the draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77. He emphasized how important it was for the United Nations to continue the debate on the global financial integration phenomenon, the problems and the opportunities that it presented, including the debate on the instability of short-term capital flows.
The draft resolution drew on two previous resolutions, General Assembly resolution 50/91 and Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/43. However, it further emphasized the conceptual framework of the global financial integration issue and described the effects of that phenomenon on different countries and regions.
The draft also sought to give impetus to collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, which could only have favourable effects for all parties concerned.
9. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.28 was withdrawn.
Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.16/Rev.1: International trade and development
10. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, said that the draft resolution was novel in that it was not just a text introduced by the Vice-Chairman and adopted by consensus, but a draft sponsored by a number of countries.
However, its uniqueness stemmed from more than just the number of sponsors.
An effort had also been made to implement the provisions of General Assembly resolution 50/227.
Accordingly, the preamble had been condensed in an effort to streamline the text, and the draft was divided into three sections: the first section was devoted to the ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the second section to the multilateral trade system, and the third section to other questions related to trade and development.
He recommended its adoption by consensus.
11. Ms. KELLEY (Secretary of the Committee), in reference to paragraph 14 of draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.16/Rev.1, said that the Secretary-General would soon present his proposed programme budget for 1998-1999, dealing, inter alia, with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and that his proposals would be considered by the competent bodies in accordance with established procedures.
12. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.16/Rev.1 was adopted.
13. Mr. FLORENCIO (Brazil) said that it was the first time a draft resolution on international trade and development prepared by the Group of 77 had been co-sponsored by developed countries. That unprecedented circumstance was testimony to their political will to cooperate in North-South relations and set an example for the development-related work of the United Nations.
14. He reiterated the Vice-Chairman's observation that the draft resolution was much shorter and much more action-oriented than those previously adopted.
By confirming the consensus reached in Midrand, South Africa, and providing broad support for the draft, the General Assembly was restating its confidence in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development by recognizing that the Conference had adopted far-reaching reforms and should from now on devote itself to its vast programme of work.
15. Regarding the World Trade Organization, the draft resolution reaffirmed the major role that the Organization played as a framework for a rule-based multilateral trading system, and requested that its Ministerial Conference in Singapore should make an effort to achieve balanced results taking into account the concerns of all countries, in particular those of developing countries.
16. Mr. MOGOTSI (South Africa) said that, as host of the ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, South Africa welcomed the fact that the draft resolution on international trade and development had met with consensus and broad-based co-sponsorship, including the United States, the Russian Federation, Norway, Japan and Mexico.
The extreme diversity of sponsors of the draft reflected the relevance and dynamic nature of the "Partnership for Growth and Development" established in Midrand, and his delegation expressed its appreciation to those who were helping to ensure that the Partnership went beyond mere rhetoric.
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.14 and L.49: Commodities
17. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria) said that, in reference to the last paragraph of the draft resolution, concerning the scheduling of consideration of the item, it had been decided during informal consultations that the General Assembly would henceforth consider it every two years and would take it up again at the fifty-third session.
He invited the Committee to adopt the draft by consensus.
18. Mr. OUATTARA (Côte d'Ivoire) said that, as coordinator, he would like to introduce some clarifications omitted from the final wording of the draft resolution.
After "a driving force of investments and" the word "contributor" was to be inserted in the second preambular paragraph.
In paragraph 4, the word "emphasizes" was to be replaced by "expresses".
In the second line of paragraph 6 (c), the word "aim" was to be replaced by "have as their objective", which was the wording adopted at the ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In the fifth line of paragraph 12, after "Net Food-Importing Developing Countries", the word "and" was to be inserted. In the sixth line, the words "the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development" were to be replaced by "it" to avoid repetition.
19. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.49, as orally revised, was adopted.
20. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.14 was withdrawn.
Draft decision on various reports, notes and comments of the Secretary-General (A/51/388, A/51/331, A/51/255, A/51/152, A/51/152/Add.1)
21. The CHAIRMAN introduced a draft decision concerning agenda item 94 which read: "The General Assembly takes note of the following documents: Report of the Secretary-General on global financial integration: challenges and opportunities (A/51/388); Report of the Secretary-General on strengthening international organizations in the area of multilateral trade (A/51/331); Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development concerning specific measures in favour of island developing countries (A/51/255); Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled `United Nations Conference on Trade and Development: Review of institutional and programme issues' (A/51/152) and the comments of the Secretary-General on the above-mentioned report of the Joint Inspection Unit (A/51/152/Add.1)".
22. The draft decision was adopted.
23. The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee had concluded its consideration of agenda item 94.
(a) INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION (continued) (A/C.2/51/L.12 and L.46, A/C.2/51/L.38 and L.47)
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.12 and L.46: Industrial development cooperation
24. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.46 on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.12.
As a consensus had been reached during informal consultations, he recommended that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.
25. Ms. LEBL (United States of America) stated that her delegation disassociated itself from the draft resolution.
In particular, it had reservations concerning the sixth preambular paragraph.
She reaffirmed that the United States understood that the expression "sustained economic growth" as it appeared in the resolutions referred to growth in the framework of sustainable development, as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and maintained by the heads of State and Government of more than 130 countries during the World Summit for Social Development.
The entire paragraph in question read:
She requested that her statement should be fully reflected in the summary record of the meeting.

27. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.12 was withdrawn.
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.38 and L.47: Food and sustainable agricultural development
28. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.47, produced after consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.38. He recalled that the text had been introduced after the World Food Summit, held in Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996, and was a follow-up to the Plan of Action adopted on that occasion.
29. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.47 was adopted.
30. Mr. WEIBGEN (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) pointed out that the draft resolution had several provisions concerning the follow-up to the Summit, and concerning reports to the Economic and Social Council and to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session.
31. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.38 was withdrawn.
Draft decision on the report of the Secretary-General on the use of freshwater resources for food and agricultural production, as well as the implications of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations for food production, including agro-industrial products and on global food security in developing countries (A/51/431)
32. The CHAIRMAN introduced a draft decision under agenda item 95 that read: "The General Assembly takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the use of freshwater resources for food and agricultural production, as well as the implications of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations for food production, including agro-industrial products and on global food security in developing countries (A/51/431)".
33. The draft decision was adopted.
AGENDA ITEM 96: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION (continued) (A/C.2/51/L.23, L.45, L.21, L.52, L.19, L.43, L.15/Rev.1*, L.18 and L.51)

34. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.45 which was being proposed after consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.23, and stated that the words "entitled Communication for development in the United Nations system," should be added at the end of the first preambular paragraph. He recommended that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.

The entire paragraph in question read:
44. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.19 was withdrawn.

47. The CHAIRMAN emphasized that the draft had no programme budget implications.
48. Ms. LEBL (United States of America) said that the words "from within existing resources" in paragraph 19 should therefore be deleted.
49. Mr. SEATON (South Africa), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, reaffirmed that the Group opposed linking statements on programme budget implications and the use of the words "from within existing resources".
50. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.15/Rev.1*, as orally revised, was adopted.
51. Mr. AARDAL (Norway) said that his delegation had reservations concerning paragraphs 19 and 33 and pointed out that it was important to guarantee transparency in the evaluation.

52. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.51, submitted on the basis of consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.18. Although the title referred to the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, the text was about the overall problem of poverty.
In the text, the General Assembly welcomed the initiative to convene a micro-credit summit in Washington, D.C., from 2 to 4 February 1997.
He recommended that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.

55. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.18 was withdrawn.

56. The CHAIRMAN drew attention to document A/C.2/51/L.48, which contained the programme budget implications of the draft.
57. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran) introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.39, submitted after consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.10. He recommended that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.
58. Ms. LEBL (United States of America) said that her delegation was in favour of the draft resolution but, in view of the potential implications of paragraph 12, she would like to make some clarifications.
Several important questions concerning the transition period leading up to the establishment of a permanent secretariat remained pending.
The interim secretariat should provide as soon as possible an estimate of its needs during the transition period so that a knowledgeable decision could be made regarding the resources to be allotted for that period.
The United States would like the question of resources to be considered during the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
The resources allocated to the negotiation process, which had been paid into the special Trust Fund and the Special Voluntary Fund, should be drawn upon first, and the regular budget should be used only when all extrabudgetary resources had been exhausted.
59. Mr. CHOUINARD (Canada) said that his delegation would like to sponsor the draft.
60. Mr. O'CONNELL (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that his delegation supported the resolution, it being understood that nothing in it should prejudge the decisions to be taken by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention or by the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, or the decisions to be taken concerning the programme budget for the 1998-1999 biennium.
61. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.39 was adopted.
62. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.10 was withdrawn.

63. Ms. KELLEY (Secretary of the Committee) pointed out that the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.41 were contained in document A/C.5/50/43 of 13 December 1995.
64. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran) introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.41 and recommended that it should be adopted by consensus. The sponsors of A/C.2/51/L.11 were prepared to withdraw their draft.
65. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.41 was adopted.
66. Mr. DELANEY (Papua New Guinea), speaking as coordinator of the Group of 77 and China, expressed satisfaction with the progress made since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 50/113.
Only 11 weeks remained before the preparatory meeting of the special session and some essential questions had yet to be settled, including the participation of the major groups and non-governmental organizations.
Although the Second Committee could not consider this type of question in detail, the text of the resolution provided for a broader range of consultations with the President of the General Assembly.
The Group of 77 and China did not by any means want the process to lead to the elaboration of an abbreviated version of Agenda 21. The consideration should be the occasion for all to confirm the commitments made and to make practical suggestions.
Participants in the special session should consider the progress made and make available the necessary resources to assist developing countries.
In the spirit of compromise, the Group of 77 and China had deleted any reference to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, but were convinced that it was an essential principle.
67. Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.9 and L.11 were withdrawn.
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.5 and L.31: Convention on Biological Diversity
68. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-Chairman, introducing draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.31, submitted after informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.5, said that he would like to make an amendment to paragraph 5, replacing the word "secretariat" with the words "Executive Secretary" in order to use the same wording as in paragraph 6 of document UNEP/CBD/COP/3/L.10, adopted at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
He recommended that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.
69. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.31, as orally revised, was adopted.
70. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.5 was withdrawn.
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.4 and L.42: International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
71. The CHAIRMAN said that the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.4, contained in document A/C.2/51/L.36, did not apply to draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.42.
72. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.42, submitted after informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.4. He hoped that it would be adopted by consensus.
73. Mr. PRENDERGAST (Jamaica), Coordinator for the Group of 77 and China, said that he would like to make the following changes to paragraph 14 of the English text. In the fourth and fifth lines, the words "to" and "proposals" should be added, so that the sentence would read: "and to set forth in his substantive report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, proposals regarding the format ...".
74. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.42, as orally revised, was adopted.
75. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.4 was withdrawn.
AGENDA ITEM 98: OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT (continued) (A/C.2/51/L.8 and L.44)
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.8 and L.44: Operational activities for development
76. Ms. KELLEY (Secretary of the Committee) said that under paragraph 27, the General Assembly would decide to convene a special session in 2001 in order to review the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children.
As the meeting schedule had yet to be established, it was not possible to give an estimate of conference-servicing costs, but the dates, duration and services required for the special session and preparatory meetings would be determined in consultation with UNICEF, at which time assessment of the programme budget implications would be made.
77. Ms. REBONG (Philippines), Coordinator for the Group of 77 and China, said that the order of paragraphs 5 and 6 should be inverted.
78. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introducing draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.44, submitted after informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.8, said that the text emerging from the consultations stressed the need for assistance for children in especially difficult circumstances, including those victims of conflicts or those suffering from exploitation.
Agreement on the paragraph concerning the convening of a special session in 2001 had been particularly difficult, but he hoped that the draft would be adopted by consensus.
79. Mr. BURHAN (Turkey) and Mr. LOZANO (Mexico) said that their delegations would like to sponsor the draft resolution.
80. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.44, as orally revised, was adopted.
81. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.8 was withdrawn.
Draft decision on a note by the Secretary-General (A/51/391)
83. The draft decision was adopted.
AGENDA ITEM 12: REPORT OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL (continued) (A/C.2/51/L.29, L.30/Rev.2 and L.37)
Draft resolutions A/C.2/51/L.29 and L.30/Rev.2: Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, and the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources
84. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.30/Rev.2, and said that, as it had not been possible to reach a consensus during informal consultations, it would be necessary to have a vote.
85. Mr. IBRAHIM (Malaysia) said that Algeria, Cuba, Jordan and Saudi Arabia would like to sponsor the draft resolution.
86. Mr. MANOR (Israel), speaking in explanation of vote before the voting, said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995, and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way.
The principle of direct negotiations also applied to Syria and Lebanon, and he invited them to resume negotiations with his country.
The real objective of the draft resolution was to predetermine the outcome of the negotiations, which contradicted the spirit and letter of the Interim Agreement and of the Madrid Conference.
His delegation would vote against the draft and invited other delegations that supported the peace process to do the same.
87. Mr. HAMDAN (Lebanon) pointed out that occupation was the most serious obstacle to economic development. He was well aware that the Second Committee was not authorized to deal with political problems, but the problems were of an economic nature.
The international community should remain faithful to the spirit of the Charter and stress the disastrous consequences of the occupation.
The implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) would allow for the establishment of a climate of peace in the region and put an end to the violent acts taking place there.
Lebanon was asking other countries not to help settle its internal problems, but to add no new ones.
He therefore requested the immediate withdrawal of the occupying Israeli forces.
88. At the request of the representative of the United States of America, a recorded vote was taken on draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.30/Rev.2.
In favour: Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Canada, Chad, Chile, China, Comoros, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
Against: Israel, United States of America.
Abstaining: Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Côte d'Ivoire, El Salvador, Fiji, Georgia, Kenya, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Ukraine, Uruguay.
89. The draft resolution was adopted by 123 votes to 2, with 17 abstentions.
90. Mr. TANAKA (Japan) said that his Government participated actively in the peace process, having already provided approximately $200 million. Japan had therefore voted in favour of the draft resolution, but that did not prejudge its position on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations or the status of the occupied territories.
His delegation believed, however, that the Second Committee was not the appropriate forum for the draft resolution, as it contained very political elements.
91. Mr. MURPHY (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the European Union, stated that it recognized the applicability of the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
It also believed that the issues taken up in the draft should be dealt with in negotiations on the permanent status, and that the adoption of the draft should not be seen as prejudging their outcome.
The European Union was concerned by the addition of a supplementary item to the already heavy agenda of the Second Committee.
92. Mr. WINNICK (United States of America) expressed his delegation's firm opposition to the draft resolution, which involved the General Assembly in the direct negotiations under way and amounted to a prejudgement of their outcome.
The explicit reference to Jerusalem was unacceptable.
The United States had voted against the resolution because it risked compromising the efforts of the parties involved in the direct negotiations.
93. Mr. FERNÁNDEZ PALACIO (Argentina) said that his delegation's abstention did not contradict Argentina's long-standing support for the Security Council resolution mentioned in the draft, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force and the applicability of the Geneva Convention.
94. Ms. CARAYANIDES (Australia) said that her delegation had voted in favour of the draft resolution as the goal of the text was to guarantee that the natural resources in the occupied territories were not used inappropriately.
The goal was not to undermine the outcome of the negotiations.
95. Ms. McVEY (Canada) said that the proliferation of resolutions was not good for the United Nations and its various committees. The draft resolution just adopted was an example of proliferation.
However, as Canada was in favour of several elements of the draft, it had voted in favour.
She had noted the reference to the ongoing process of negotiations, and believed that they offered the best way to settle the problems covered in the draft, as well as the question of the status of Jerusalem.
She also believed that the adoption of the draft should not be considered as prejudging the outcome of the peace process.
96. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his delegation's vote in favour of the draft resolution should not be regarded as a recognition of Israel.
97. Mr. SEYOUM (Eritrea) said that his delegation had intended to vote in favour as in previous years, but its vote had not registered on the board. He requested that that fact should be reflected in the summary record of the meeting.
Mr. MONTOYA (Colombia) said that, if his delegation had been present during the voting, it would have voted in favour of the draft.
98. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.29 was withdrawn.
Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.37: United Nations Declaration against Corruption and Bribery in International Commercial Transactions
99. Mr. RAMOUL (Algeria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.37, and said that the Economic and Social Council had recommended that the draft should be adopted by consensus. It has been approved by consensus during informal consultations.
100. Mr. AMMARIN (Jordan) said that his delegation would like to co-sponsor the draft.
101. Ms. CARAYANIDES (Australia) said that Australia fought against corruption and would like to join the consensus.
Her Government had not yet taken a final decision on the criminalization of certain practices and the tax deductibility of bribes.
102. Mr. YUAN Shaofu (China) said that corruption was a high-priority problem which he hoped would be the subject of further consultations.
103. The CHAIRMAN announced that Bolivia and Ecuador had joined the sponsors of the draft.
104. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.37 was adopted.
105. Mr. WINNICK (United States of America), Mr. LOZANO (Mexico), Mr. SEATON (South Africa) and Mr. VIVAS (Venezuela) welcomed the adoption of the resolution on the fight against corruption, which marked a stage in international cooperation in the struggle against bribery and sent a crucial and unequivocal message to ordinary criminals. 105 bis.
Mr. LOZANO (Mexico) stated that an attempt should be made to eradicate tax havens and the influence of certain transnational corporations which sometimes served as accomplices.
Draft decision on various reports and notes by the Secretary-General
107. The draft decision was adopted.
108. The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 12.
Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.17: Integration of the economies in transition into the world economy
109. Mr. DJABBARY (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.17, submitted after informal consultations. Its adoption by consensus had been recommended during the consultations.
At the end of the last preambular paragraph, the following words should be added: "in accordance with the multilateral trading agreements". In the fifth line of paragraph 2, the words "within existing resources" should be deleted.
110. The CHAIRMAN informed the Committee that the adoption of the draft resolution would have no budgetary implications.
111. Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) informed the Committee that Argentina and Israel had joined the sponsors of the draft resolution.
112. Draft resolution A/C.2/51/L.17 was adopted.
113. Mr. SABOIA (Brazil) expressed his country's firm support of the efforts made by the countries with economies in transition towards integration into the world economy.
114. Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) warmly thanked all of the countries that had supported the draft resolution.
The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.

SECOND COMMITTEE
5th meeting held on

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 5th MEETING
Chairman: Mr. HAMBURGER (Netherlands)
CONTENTS
GENERAL DEBATE (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
1. Mr. KA (Senegal) said that despite the fact that the cold war had ended, the world situation at the end of the century was much less stable than had been hoped.
Certainly, the advances achieved in creating a climate of peace and cooperation had raised legitimate hopes of sharing in the dividends of peace.
Nevertheless, those dividends, which could facilitate the work of social and economic development sponsored by the United Nations, had yet to appear.
Many regions of the world continued to suffer from poverty, unemployment, disease, poorly controlled population growth and environmental deterioration, sometimes on an unprecedented scale.
2. Clearly, under the current conditions of interdependence, the attainment of lasting international peace and security depended fundamentally on the international community's ability to find practical solutions to those problems.
3. In Senegal's view, the series of major United Nations international conferences that would culminate in the World Food Summit had clearly reflected the closely interdependent relationships that existed among peace, development and the security of humankind.
4. Currently, all that was lacking was the political will to fulfil the commitments undertaken, by means of adequately mobilizing new and additional resources.
The paradoxical result was that, in an era of continuously growing need, official development assistance was plummeting.
5. Senegal reiterated the need to establish a new form of joint participation in development, sustained by common but differentiated accountability and by a genuine spirit of solidarity. That would entail envisioning a new world, definitively solving the debt problem, renouncing protectionist and isolationist measures, protecting the environment and universally applying transparent, non-discriminatory and equitable trade rules, as agreed to in the relevant international accords.
6. The mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s had revealed the great progress achieved by the African countries in the political, economic and social spheres, with the goal of creating and strengthening the framework necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development.
Although several praiseworthy initiatives had been undertaken, such as the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, the international community had yet to fulfil the commitments it had made in connection with the implementation of the New Agenda.
7. In view of the collapse five years previously of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, the development partners of that continent should redouble their efforts to ensure that the New Agenda would not have similarly discouraging results.
In any case, the era of unfulfilled promises seemed to have definitively ended and the need to follow through was greater than ever before.
8. Africa wished to break out of the cycle of assistance and indebtedness, and hoped to open markets for its products in order to be able to take its rightful place in the world economy and finance the development process on its own.
With that objective in mind, the African countries had initiated reforms to encourage private-sector initiative, mobilize domestic resources and attract foreign investors.
9. Finally, he called upon the partners in African development to recognize the significance of the silent revolution arising from the reforms in progress and highlighted the importance of the principles of solidarity and complementarity and of the spirit of joint participation that should govern international cooperation.
10. Mr. BACHARD (Niger) expressed his delegation's support for the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and said that the ending of the cold war, the ratification by a large number of States of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty marked a decisive step in the history of humanity.
In that context, Niger invited the international community to continue to actively promote world peace.
Nevertheless, such peace would not last without the adoption of concrete, radical measures to eliminate poverty and establish universally applicable rules of justice.
11. More than half the world's population lived in poverty, and the least developed countries suffered the worst consequences of that situation. In particular, the debt problem had increased to an intolerable level.
That required a rapid and appropriate decision that would offer a solution to some of the crucial problems confronting developing countries, especially the least developed among them.
12. Niger firmly believed that the means existed to achieve the well-being of the world's population and that the United Nations could act as a catalyst to that end.
The financial and economic difficulties of developing countries derived mainly from political considerations affecting international investments, and not from a lack of cost-effective projects.
The United Nations system should encourage investors to consider only the criteria of security and profitability in their initiatives for the production of goods and services.
Financial speculation on the part of some countries of the North was causing false monetary devaluations and adversely affecting the terms of trade, to the economic detriment of the countries of the South.
13. The praiseworthy initiative of the Bretton Woods institutions to create a multilateral trust fund for alleviating the external debt of the least developed countries had nevertheless fallen short of meeting the expectations of those countries, which had hoped for the cancellation of their debt.
14. Increased official development aid was another major factor for the economies of developing countries and should be given urgent consideration.
Without overlooking the need for States to increase domestic saving, official development aid was one of the essential conditions for reviving the development process in the least developed countries. The developed countries' contributions should therefore reach the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national product laid down in General Assembly resolutions.
He welcomed the efforts of certain Member States to fulfil their commitments.
15. Urgent consideration should also be given to the implementation of the Marrakesh agreements, within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Carrying out infrastructure projects and providing technical and financial aid to enable developing countries to implement a policy of export diversification, both horizontal and vertical, would provide those countries with the means to achieve effective economic development.
16. At recent major United Nations international conferences, it had been clear that the world community had become aware of the realities of life of peoples in certain parts of the world.
Even so, most political decision makers and the peoples of many countries were unaware of the exact significance of the political, economic and social mechanisms leading to absolute poverty in some countries.
In order to remedy that ignorance, it was vital that the United Nations should elaborate new working methods to further increase awareness among decision makers, such as parliamentarians, civil society and peoples, by giving them more information on United Nations activities and on the status and mechanisms of multilateral cooperation.
17. Programmes about the United Nations shown by the mass media were insufficient.
The number of hours of such programmes should be increased, and press articles should be published in every country.
Direct contact should also be promoted among peoples, through their parliamentary representatives and other authorities.
In short, international information on developing countries should cease to reflect solely the major problems afflicting them; it should also deal with the causes of those problems.
18. Mr. JAYANAMA (Thailand) supported the views expressed in Costa Rica's statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well as those contained in the ministerial declaration adopted at the 20th Annual Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 and China.
19. His delegation was encouraged by the continued expansion of the economies of the developing countries and the positive achievements which had also taken place among least developed countries in Africa and Asia.
Those favourable trends should encourage all Member States to intensify international cooperation.
20. Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy, the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries, and that their sole objective was to make profits.
That contrasted with public-sector objectives, which were broader because, depending on the stage of development of their countries, Governments had different priorities and pursued different policies on many important economic and trade issues, including how to achieve sustainable development.
Consequently, there was no common view on globalization, and intergovernmental cooperation within the framework of the United Nations was more difficult.
21. As for the relationship between economic growth and sustainable development, Thailand, which had established that there was a strong linkage between economic growth and human development, saw the former as an indispensable factor for human development and sustainable development as a whole.
22. Nonetheless, sustained economic growth could only take place with the implementation of consistent macroeconomic policies and other government decisions.
There must be domestic political will at the national level and commitment to development by peoples and their leaders. A favourable international environment was also necessary.
23. Concerning the current negotiations on the reform of the United Nations, he recalled that during the previous year's debate in the Second Committee, his delegation had expressed its dissatisfaction at the absence of a common political will regarding international cooperation, particularly the role of the United Nations in development.
The divergence of views had also obstructed the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50/227.
In addition, an agenda for development, which would provide an outline for reform of the role of the United Nations in the area of development and a framework for international cooperation, had yet to be completed.
His delegation considered that those two important tasks should be concluded and implemented as soon as possible. He urged all Member States to show maximum flexibility in the negotiations on an agenda for development and to concentrate on issues on which agreement had not yet been reached.
24. His delegation considered that the Second Committee's work should be focused on reviewing the implementation of recommendations produced by major United Nations conferences relating to development.
All Member States should examine the progress or setbacks of international cooperation in the areas of environment, population, job creation, technology transfer, capital movements, international trade and South-South cooperation.
25. Ms. RAMIRO-LOPEZ (Philippines), having associated her delegation with the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77, said that human development entailed the full realization of the potentials and capabilities of human beings, in harmony with the environment and sharing the fruits of prosperity.
Although her delegation did not agree with all the conclusions contained in the Human Development Report produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), she recognized that the development of the Human Development Index, as well as the report itself, constituted a serious and laudable effort to better reflect development and to give shape to the concept of sustainable human development.
In that respect, the Index could perhaps be expanded to include some indices relating to the environment, such as levels of pollution.
In promoting sustainable human development, account should be taken of the fact that links between economic growth and human development should be forged with political will and determination, so that they could be mutually reinforcing and so that economic growth could improve sustainable human development.
26. The East Asian countries had invested heavily in human resource development, which had contributed to the achievement of sustained economic growth for over a decade.
The Philippines had oriented its efforts towards developing the potentials of its peoples and safeguarding their well-being, as could be seen in socio-economic programmes directed towards the disadvantaged sectors of society.
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit: the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased; economic growth had been sustained; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing.
27. In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity, economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent. A supportive international economic environment characterized by openness in the global economy and consideration of the needs and conditions in the developing world would be necessary to achieve that goal.
However, the international community should guard against forces that inhibited the broadening of benefits from globalization and ensure that it led to steady increases in exports where the developing countries enjoyed a comparative advantage, especially in labour-intensive areas.
Protectionist measures were unacceptable, whether in the guise of subsidies, environmental protection, labour rights or sanitary standards.
28. Preferential treatment should be given to the exports of developing countries, with special attention being paid to the situation of the least developed countries.
In East Asia, where benefits had been obtained from trade liberalization and capital flows from abroad, the sustainability of those flows must be ensured and ways to explore their extension to the developing world in general must be studied.
29. Considering the impact of the monetary policies of the developed countries on the entire world, her delegation took note of the efforts of the group of seven major industrialized countries to strengthen the international monetary system through better coherence of their macroeconomic policies, in line with the appeal made in the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade.
30. Although it was true that there was no automatic link between economic growth and human development, the developing countries were caught in a vicious circle, because sustained economic growth was also doubtful in the absence of a certain level of human development. Those countries either stagnated economically, realized marginal growth, or took a much longer route to sustained economic growth.
31. Finally, she urged the donor countries to meet as soon as possible the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for development assistance, which was an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in order to implement fully the priorities established at the various international conferences on development.
She also drew the attention of the international community to the debt problem of developing countries, especially the least developed countries. Solving that problem would require more than the flexibility offered under the Naples terms, and she stressed that the consensus reached in the negotiations should provide appropriate support to those countries' efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development.
32. Mr. GLAVANAKOV (Bulgaria) said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union and associate countries. Bulgaria welcomed the streamlining of the activities of the relevant bodies and agencies in the United Nations system, in accordance with the concept of sustainable development.
Sustainability, in its global context, embraced the economic, environmental, social and humanitarian dimensions of development.
In recent years there had been a general trend towards globalization and liberalization, which offered new opportunities and challenges for all States, allowing them to benefit from their own comparative advantages through free and fair trade.
33. Bulgaria attached particular importance to its full integration into the world trading system as a prerequisite for sustained economic growth and development, and to the integration of countries with economies in transition into the world economy.
The level of foreign investment flows in the economies of such States and access for their products to the markets of developed economies were still insufficient to generate sustainable economic growth.
In his delegation's view, the United Nations should intensify its efforts to support the process of integrating countries with economies in transition into the world economy on the basis of each country's respective stage of transformation and restructuring, encouraging the establishment of private businesses and market-oriented management of State-owned enterprises.
Those elements, along with systematic coordination of the activities of the United Nations, international financial institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO), should be taken into account in designing programme activities in the countries in transition.
34. Another matter closely related to sustainable development was the issue of foreign debt, which the international community should continue working to overcome, since it was an obstacle to sustainable development in various countries and regions of the world.
35. His delegation noted with satisfaction the adoption of General Assembly resolution 50/227. The specific problems of the countries with economies in transition, however, could be reflected more thoroughly in the agenda of a substantive session of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies.
36. The special session of the General Assembly in 1997 for the appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 and of the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development should be properly prepared in order to achieve its goal.
His delegation was satisfied with the successful work completed by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session, especially the review of all chapters of Agenda 21 in the context of its first multi-year thematic programme of work.
It shared the opinion that the special session should not attempt to renegotiate Agenda 21, but should focus on its further implementation.
Bulgaria supported the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, bearing in mind the economic and technological potential of the different States.
The exchange of environmentally sound technologies should be further liberalized so as to enable the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to fulfil their obligations successfully.
37. Another relevant issue in the context of sustainable development was special economic assistance to third States adversely affected by the implementation of Security Council economic sanctions.
The suspension of sanctions did not eliminate their long-term negative consequences for the economies of affected third States even though the participation of such States in the ongoing peace process, and, together with other partners, in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the crisis-stricken areas did partially alleviate the negative impact of sanctions.
38. The practical steps aimed at rendering concrete assistance to affected third States remained highly insufficient, however.
Bearing in mind the seriousness of the problem, Bulgaria intended to resubmit a draft resolution on the subject at the current session of the General Assembly. The promotion of active economic cooperation in the region was a way to help in alleviating the negative impact of sanctions.
In July 1996 Bulgaria had convened a conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Countries of South-Eastern Europe, at which a variety of possibilities for intensifying regional cooperation in various fields had been discussed, including cross-border infrastructure, promotion of trade and investment, and cooperation in combating organized crime and illicit drug trafficking. The results of the conference were outlined in the Sofia Declaration, issued as an official United Nations document (A/51/211-S/1996/551).
39. Mr. SIKRA (Slovakia) said that changes in the global economic and political structure had led to the emergence of new challenges and opportunities for the international community.
The economic performance of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in 1995 had been mixed.
In some countries, mainly the members of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), considerable progress had been made in the transition from central planning to a market economy and growth rates of the gross domestic product (GDP) of between 5 and 7 per cent had been achieved.
Slovakia's economy had boomed in 1995, with the GDP increasing by 7.4 per cent. The process of transformation to a market economy had basically been completed, as shown by the fact that the private sector accounted for almost two thirds of the GDP in 1995.
The National Bank was strongly committed to low inflation and stable currency targets.
40. With regard to regional economic integration, Slovakia had signed an association agreement with the European Union (EU) in 1993. That agreement had entered into force in 1995 and had opened the way to expanded trade with EU.
Slovakia was also a party to an agreement with the Central European countries to lower and eliminate trade barriers beginning in 1997.
Slovakia supported modern models of sustainable production and consumption and the principles of sustainable development, and, in that connection, recognized the need to seek solutions to environmental problems in a pan-European and global context.
41. His Government attached great importance to the activities of regional and international bodies of the United Nations system, such as the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), which in spite of its scarce financial and personnel resources, was carrying out valuable work.
ECE should continue to prepare independent in-depth analyses of economic growth in the countries in transition and provide assistance to those countries, especially for the implementation of wide-ranging economic reforms and the promotion of the integration of those countries in the European and world economy.
ECE should collaborate in activities in which pan-European cooperation was required and which could not be carried out by subregional associations or other international organizations.
42. The ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) had shown UNCTAD to be the most suitable forum for the integrated solution of problems involving trade in services and raw materials, investment, technology, enterprises and trade facilitation.
The ninth session had been a historic success in bringing about reform which would facilitate the integration of developing countries in the international trading system.
In that connection, cooperation between the CEFTA countries was a good example of participation by developing countries in a multilateral trading system and their integration in the global economy.
It should be noted that the CEFTA countries provided the developing countries with a very liberal Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), with specific advantages for the least developed countries.
43. His country paid special attention to cooperation with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), which was in a period of consolidation of reform.
His delegation agreed with the general policy of UNDP to allocate the bulk of its resources to countries with per capita GDP lower than $750, but believed it was necessary to continue to support development programmes in the countries in transition.
44. As far as the Second Committee itself was concerned, his delegation supported rationalization of its work and efforts to define more clearly the work of the Second and Third Committees.
In that connection, it believed that the General Committee of the General Assembly should ensure better coordination and harmonization of the work of those two Main Committees and determine where duplication in the consideration of items was inevitable and where it was useless.
His delegation likewise supported the view that the Economic and Social Council should remain the main body for management of the economic and social activities of the United Nations and that its efforts should be focused on policy-making rather than on management of specific operations. It supported in principle the proposals for reform of the Council contained in the Secretary-General's "Agenda for Development".
45. Mr. THEOPHYLACTOU (Cyprus) said that the Second Committee should tackle pressing international economic issues that affected developed and developing countries alike. For the latter countries, such issues were not only crucial but often determined the very survival of their peoples.
There was no doubt that the development of Africa should be a high priority and, in that connection, his country welcomed the recent entry into force of the Convention to Combat Desertification. It trusted that the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, the mid-term review of which had been concluded recently, would be fully implemented.
His country had always supported, to the extent it was able, initiatives for the development of Africa and would continue to support all international initiatives for the eradication of poverty and the promotion of social and economic development and sustainable human development in Africa.
46. His country was also engaged in regional cooperation schemes in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region and provided assistance to Central and Eastern European countries for their reconstruction.
His country's main objective was the achievement of social justice in conditions of economic freedom and democracy, constant improvement of living standards and an equitable distribution of wealth.
47. Although Cyprus was doing well in the economic sphere, he wished to point out that the dire economic situation in the Turkish-occupied parts of the island affected all Cypriots, but especially the Turkish Cypriots.
Despite the continuing invasion and occupation of a substantial part of its territory, Cyprus was a sponsor of various useful meetings and seminars dealing with a wide range of economic and development issues, and, in that connection, his delegation agreed that a "new and equitable partnership" must be based on equality and that economic cooperation for development must be the central objective of that process.
Economic and social development and environmental protection were mutually reinforcing elements and led to sustainable development.
In that connection, his country looked forward to the preparations for the special session of the General Assembly on the review and implementation of Agenda 21.
48. Small States must rally together on economic and development issues.
His country had been successful in bringing together experts from small States to address common problems and seek solutions through partnership.
Because of the small size of their economies, their limited natural wealth and their dependence on a small number of commodities, small States were especially vulnerable to outside risks.
Increased cooperation could help those States to have a stronger voice in world markets and international forums.
He consequently urged the prompt implementation of the policy recommendations of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, which had been held in Barbados.
He pledged his country's support for appropriate follow-up of major United Nations conferences and expressed the strong belief that what was important was practical implementation, not simply taking decisions.
49. Mr. MAHUGU (Kenya), after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth, with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent, that growth rate concealed sharp regional, subregional and national differences.
Although Africa had registered a positive GDP growth rate of 2.7 per cent, many African countries were still among the poorest in the world, and, according to the World Economic and Social Survey, 1996, the improved economic performance of the African continent was a short-term phenomenon which in some cases was being offset by the high population growth rate.
Therefore, unless it accelerated, economic growth would not be sufficient to bring about a significant alleviation of poverty in the region.
50. Many developing countries were continuing to implement structural adjustment programmes, which had adverse effects on the social sector.
Kenya was committed to the implementation of comprehensive structural reforms with a view to achieving long-term economic growth and sustainable development.
However, although Kenya's economy was fully liberalized and the reform measures had created an enabling environment for the promotion of investment, Kenya's economy remained vulnerable to an unfavourable external economic environment because of low commodity prices and declining financial resource flows.
Reform efforts should therefore be matched by international commitment, understanding and support from development partners.
51. The multilateral and bilateral debt of the developing countries was a major obstacle to economic growth; his Government believed that an early consensus on effective debt relief, reduction and possible cancellation would go a long way towards alleviating that problem.
The external debt burden was being exacerbated by the dismal participation of a majority of the developing countries in world trade, deteriorating terms of trade and net negative transfer of resources from developing countries to developed countries.
52. Consequently, in order to achieve economic growth in the developing countries, their commodities must have access to international markets so as to bring about an increase in export earnings.
In that connection, it was essential for WTO to assist in the establishment of a system that would uphold the rights and interests of the weaker countries.
Compensation should also be provided to the developing countries which encountered short-term losses as a result of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements.
In addition, Kenya believed that the ministerial conference of the member countries of WTO to be held shortly in Singapore should take stock of the Uruguay Round agreements and their implications for the multilateral trading system, discarding new concepts that linked trade measures to domestic standards in the spheres of the environment and labour laws.
53. The United Nations should continue to play a fundamental role with a view to achieving consensus on international economic cooperation.
In that respect, it was significant that the agenda for development which was currently being formulated by the General Assembly enhanced the relationship between the United Nations and its specialized agencies in order to foster sustained economic growth and development.
It would be preferable for cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions to be carried out through the Economic and Social Council, whose organs should be strengthened in order to follow up effectively the programmes of action agreed upon at the international conferences.
54. The series of global conferences held in recent years had made it possible to create a new vision of development.
The most recent conference, HABITAT II, had endorsed the necessity for quick action in addressing the need for adequate shelter for all as well as sustainable human settlements.
The achievement of those objectives required a strengthening of the role of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements and the provision, by the international community, of new and additional resources from domestic and international sources.
His delegation strongly supported the efforts made so far by the Secretary-General of the summit and hoped that the clear objectives of the summit would galvanize the support of the international community for food and agricultural issues in future years.
56. Kenya was committed to regional economic integration and cooperation; a new chapter had been opened in that process in Africa with the entry into force of the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community in 1993.
Through the ratification of that treaty, the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA) had been transformed into a Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which had implemented vital programmes on tariff reduction and harmonization, transport and communications.
57. Efforts to integrate the economies of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya were another milestone in the subregion.
The three Heads of State had agreed on steps to be taken to that end and the harmonization of the various aspects of cooperation and integration was already underway in the areas of trade, transport and communications, finance, investment and subregional immigration and security.
58. Convinced that economic cooperation among developing countries was a vital means of widening the scope of international cooperation and accelerating the economic growth and productivity of developing countries, the member States of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), namely Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Kenya, had recently revitalized that body and expanded its mandate to include issues of development and conflict prevention, management and resolution.
Kenya appealed to all its development partners to complement those efforts with technical and financial support in order to facilitate the effective implementation of the programmes and projects for Africa's economic integration.
59. Mr. AHMED (India) said that his delegation associated itself with the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77. The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics: in the case of the developed countries, there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion, but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates, and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies; in the case of the developing countries, there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade, but also problems of poverty, lack of infrastructure, human resources and technological strength.
60. In 1996 his Government had adopted the Common Minimum Programme, which entailed a continuation of the liberalization and reform programme.
Greater attention would be paid to the needs of social development and the empowerment of underprivileged communities and sectors with the aim of eradicating absolute poverty by the year 2005.
61. As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations, the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows, better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory, concessional and preferential basis.
However, very few concrete measures had been taken in that respect, and in that regard it was encouraging to note that those issues would be discussed at the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council in 1997.
62. Nor could the need for a substantial increase in official development assistance be disputed.
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty, levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera.
63. His delegation welcomed the recent initiative to tackle the problem of multilateral debt and to enhance rescheduling by the Paris Club; however, the approach must be broadened, bearing in mind the requirements of economic growth and social and environmental sector investments.
There was still a pressing need to find an early and lasting solution to all types of debt which also took into account the problems and requirements of individual countries. Special attention should also be focused on low-income countries and on those that were tackling the problem of widespread poverty; in that connection, schemes such as debt-for-environment and debt-for-social development swaps should be considered.
64. Those efforts must be supplemented by measures to accelerate the flow of private investment to developing countries through the use of such instruments as guarantees, co-financing and insurance schemes by the international financial institutions.
Efforts could also be made to develop physical and economic infrastructure and human capital in order to attract and absorb foreign investment flows.
At the same time, ways must be found, including through the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to tackle problems arising from the potential volatility of some of the private capital flows and the resulting destabilization in recipient countries.
65. Although many donors attributed the lack of development to policies that did not allow the market to function properly or entrepreneurship to flourish, in the past few years, many developing countries had introduced market-oriented reforms. Ironically, however, they had become more dependent on the vagaries of the international economic system.
The United Nations should test the mechanisms governing the flow of trade, money, finance, technology and information to developing countries in order to identify remedial action as appropriate.
Developing countries should also be more involved in international macroeconomic policy-making.
66. The first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO), to be held in Singapore in December, would provide a good opportunity to seek a deepening of trade liberalization in respect of sectors of comparative advantage for developing countries, such as agriculture, textiles and clothing, footwear and leather goods. It would also be an opportunity to focus attention on the implementation of the weighty Uruguay Round package.
On that occasion, new issues, such as those relating to the social clause and the multilateral agreement on investment, trade and competition policy, should be avoided; they were complex, controversial and could adversely shift the balance against developing countries.
67. Those issues should be clearly understood in a forum such as UNCTAD before they were submitted to WTO.
Their consideration required focusing on the asymmetry in the current trade system between the rights of private operators and the obligations of Governments.
In addition, genuine liberalization of trade must be broad and include the movement of labour across national borders.
68. Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable, non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology, on the basis of a more transparent, critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged "dual use".
Proposals for setting up technology transfer rights banks and information networks on proven and environmentally sound technologies should be pursued.
69. Lastly, he wished to note the challenges to the role of the United Nations in the areas of development and economic growth, which were bound to intensify in the context of the Organization's current budgetary constraints.
70. Ms. KEW (Malaysia) echoed the comments of other delegations concerning the deplorable situation of developing countries owing to their marginalization by the globalization process, coupled with their unsustainable levels of debt and the fact that more resources had to be allocated to debt-servicing than to financing basic programmes for health, education and humanitarian relief essential for their development.
71. The situation was compounded by the reduction in assistance from industrialized countries, by cutbacks in pledges to replenish resources for international development assistance and by the unwillingness to liquidate earlier arrears.
Although the Bretton Woods institutions had the specific mandate of facilitating development and regulating the international monetary system, they were acting more as debt collectors for the wealthy countries of the North.
In 1995, the World Bank had collected a net amount of $7.2 billion in debt repayment over and above what it had disbursed in aid to the poor indebted countries, and had earned a profit of nearly $1.5 billion.
Her delegation wished to reiterate that the eradication of poverty was the centrepiece of all international efforts to achieve economic and social development, and stressed the need for urgent reform of the Bretton Woods institutions.
72. Her delegation strongly supported the globalization of international trade, but questioned the manner in which the industrialized North used it in order to preserve its economic dominance over the South. That was clearly illustrated by the efforts to frustrate initiatives to form regional consultative forums on trade and economic issues.
During the Uruguay Round negotiation process, the developing countries had discovered that the wealthy countries of the North had expanded the agenda and promoted liberalization in economic areas where they clearly had an advantage, in particular financial services and investments. She also noted efforts to deny whatever competitive edge the developing countries might have. That could be seen in the move to link trade and labour standards, not out of concern for the well-being of workers in poor countries, but rather as a protectionist measure against the growing and competitively priced imports from the South.
73. Concerning technology transfer, the countries of the North insisted that all States members of WTO should promulgate national laws to protect intellectual property rights, which, in effect, meant legal protection of the technological monopoly of the North, curtailing the right of developing countries to have access to new technologies.
Under such circumstances, it was not surprising that the developing countries believed that globalization simply meant the breaking down of national borders so that those with capital and goods could dominate the markets.
74. Malaysia hoped that the basic focus of the Ministerial Conference of WTO, to be held in Singapore in December 1996, would be on reviewing the implementation of the Uruguay Round results and not on considering new issues that were not within its competence, such as multilateral investment rules, competition policy and trade and labour standards.
WTO and the developed countries should consider as a matter of priority assisting the developing countries in order to enhance their ability to benefit fully from opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round.
Another priority issue was the enlargement of WTO membership by expediting the admission of countries that were at various stages of the process, thereby giving a truly global character to the new multilateral system.
75. Malaysia fully subscribed to the concept of sustainable development.
Although it acknowledged the critical role of national policies in that regard and the Organization's efforts to raise awareness in the world community, it believed that sustainable development required a favourable international economic environment.
Like many developing countries, it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries' failure to contribute, in clear and specific terms, the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21.
76. Malaysia was also concerned because the availability of funds and access to international funding to carry out environmental programmes and projects in developing countries were often subject to conditions which were irrelevant and which could not be met by the recipient countries.
77. In Malaysia's view, the funds needed to achieve sustainable development should be obtained through the establishment of a global system of levying taxes in proportion to each Member State's consumption of resources.
The Commission on Sustainable Development should be the institutional mechanism that monitored the flow of resources for development from the countries of the North to those of the South.
78. Malaysia, which also supported the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to appraise the implementation of Agenda 21, felt that the debates of that session should analyse compliance with the commitments made thus far, instead of continuing to discuss general aspects of sustainable development.
79. Lastly, she raised two more issues.
The first was the problem of the information technology gap between developed and developing countries.
Owing to the rapid advances being made in that field, the gap would continue to widen unless the international community took specific steps to address the situation.
The second issue was the need to recognize the role of the private sector in development.
Malaysia felt that there was an increasing need for the public and private sectors to share the burden of national development.
In Malaysia, the role of the private sector as the engine of growth had resulted from a deliberate national policy.
Therefore, discussions of development in general were incomplete unless they took the private sector's role into account.
80. Ms. BULENOVÁ (Czech Republic) said that she supported the statement made by Ireland on behalf of the European Union and its associate countries and that the many achievements of global significance which had been made in the increasingly complex modern world were accompanied by lasting problems.
Moreover, there was a certain political and economic instability related to the growing tendency towards nationalism and isolationism in some countries.
81. International multilateral forums were best suited to tackle the problems and possible impacts of globalization and liberalization for both developed and developing countries, but those institutions were losing their credibility and suffered from a lack of funds and financial discipline.
It was therefore important to strengthen confidence in the United Nations system and to reaffirm its global role in providing policy guidance.
In that connection, adjustments to the system were insufficient, since the outcome of the process also depended on the efforts and attitudes of all Member States.
82. Her country felt that efforts should focus on a number of areas.
First, the Organization's financial resources should be restructured and the efficiency of its operations should be improved. Second, an international legal framework should be established for economic cooperation, including economic security. Third, the multilateral system should be strengthened; in that regard, the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO), to be held in Singapore, would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process. Fourth, new forms of cooperation between developed and developing countries should be found.
A good example of such cooperation had been the establishment, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), of a special fund of $0.5 billion to facilitate write-offs of the debts of poor countries.
83. In addition, capacity-building, good governance, institutional reforms and better access to markets could facilitate the integration of poor countries into the world economy.
Other initiatives, such as the one on poverty eradication in Africa and the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, were positive, but would bring only temporary assistance to the countries concerned.
84. General Assembly resolution 50/227 represented a major step forward in terms of reforming the United Nations in the economic and social fields, and the Czech Republic participated actively in its implementation.
Streamlining the hierarchical structure of United Nations bodies in the economic and social spheres, enhancing the efficiency of the Economic and Social Council and redistributing the agenda items covered by the Council and by the Second and Third Committees were urgent tasks.
The positive experience with the Second Committee's programme of work, including panel discussions, should be utilized in preparing for the following year's substantive session of the Economic and Social Council.
85. The Czech Republic strongly supported the vigorous implementation of General Assembly resolution 50/120, since it would simplify and harmonize procedures and documentation, as well as monitoring and evaluation, which were important components of the United Nations reform effort.
86. She greatly appreciated the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Directorate for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, which had established new and more effective cooperation mechanisms and had brought its services closer to the region.
Her Government would welcome a more flexible approach, within the limited resources of UNDP, which would strengthen the outcome of regional programmes and projects, and was increasingly interested in extending its support to intraregional cooperation for development and in promoting the interregional exchange of ideas and experiences in the area of technical cooperation.
87. The Czech Republic closely monitored progress in the area of sustainable development and welcomed the outcome of the most recent session of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
As a result of the Commission's fruitful work, the concept of sustainable development had systematically permeated the agendas of United Nations bodies and specialized agencies, as well as those of other multilateral organizations.
88. On the other hand, her country shared the concern of a number of States with respect to other activities that followed up the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the mission of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
In her country's view, the Commission could better fulfil its mandate by emphasizing cross-sectoral issues.
89. Mr. PARK (Republic of Korea) said that the globalization of the economy since the end of the cold war had been marked by three distinct features: a deepening linkage between the economies of developed and developing countries, and intensified competition for economic excellence; the emergence of a new consensus on the importance of a market-oriented development strategy, and enhanced economic performance by those developing countries which had pursued a market-oriented and linkage-intensive development strategy; and the increasing marginalization of some developing countries, particularly the least developed and some African countries.
90. After reviewing IMF statistics constituting positive indicators of the economic performance of the developing countries, he said that the deepening linkage to which he had referred had indeed revitalized the economies of many developing countries, but had also triggered fear and mistrust both in developed countries, where some worried that cheap imports from developing countries would contribute to domestic unemployment, and in developing countries, where there were fears that indigenous industries would be destroyed by foreign multinational rivals, or that developed trading partners would use labour and environmental standards as an excuse for protectionism.
91. The role of the United Nations was to enhance trust between the North and the South by proving that a stronger linkage was beneficial to both partners and by improving the understanding of the dynamics of economic interaction on both sides.
Sustained economic growth in the developing world was an increasingly realistic prospect.
If current positive trends continued, and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization, it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries.
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership, and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries, which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development.
It should not be forgotten that the market had its own limitations and that investment was not always attuned to development needs.
92. His delegation welcomed the adoption of General Assembly resolution 50/227 and believed that the United Nations should strengthen its role in defining and promoting a new development strategy marked by increased cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions; moreover, the capacity of the Economic and Social Council to implement major decisions on international economic issues must be strengthened.
The efforts of individual organizations to restructure and enhance their own effectiveness, as in the case of UNCTAD and UNIDO, were also important.
93. The Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development had not been able, despite its achievements of the past three years, to reach a final conclusion on the issue of development, which had emerged as a priority concern of the international community; accordingly, it was appropriate that the Group's mandate had been extended until the end of the current session.
It was to be hoped that developed and developing countries would reach agreement on Part III, concerning institutional issues, which could establish a paradigm for a global development partnership.
94. The Commission on Sustainable Development, whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference, played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns, a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world.
95. It was to be hoped that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to an appraisal of the results of Agenda 21 would contribute to forging a global partnership for sustainable development which would promote progress in the areas of financing, technology transfer and vital sectoral issues.
96. His country, which had continued to increase its official development assistance and would do so in the future, planned to make large contributions to the eleventh replenishment of the International Development Association; it had also increased the cooperation funds of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
In the same spirit, the Korea International Cooperation Agency had collaborated on various projects with countries in Latin America and other regions, and the Government had worked jointly with UNDP and the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, which would be dedicated to building the capacity of developing countries to develop and use vaccines, particularly for children and low-income persons.
Such actions reflected his country's determination to continue making a contribution to the establishment of a global partnership for development and the promotion of sustainable development, which was one of the main missions of the United Nations.
97. Mr. MWAKAWAGO (United Republic of Tanzania) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair: hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future, and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty, especially in developing countries, which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership, unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated.
98. Despite the adoption of wide-ranging adjustment programmes, most developing countries could not sustain their economic policies and programmes, and were unlikely to be able to stem the decline of their economies and promote recovery and growth without sustained international cooperation which could trigger a flow of additional resources.
That was particularly urgent at a time when the forces of globalization and liberalization were becoming the driving force in world trade.
It was necessary to look closely at the policies that should be applied by all actors at all levels to ensure that the development process did not relegate the developing countries to the margins of the world economy and to facilitate foreign direct investment in a manner that contributed to sustained economic recovery and growth.
99. Since 1992 there had been a series of major United Nations conferences aimed at promoting the well-being of humanity.
What was required now was coordinated implementation of those decisions at both the national and international levels.
In that process, the critical element was the provision of new and additional financial resources to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries.
The decline in official development assistance and the restriction of capital flows were therefore a serious cause for concern.
While the primary responsibility for development remained with the developing countries themselves, they required the cooperation and solidarity of the international community in order to mobilize additional resources to support national efforts.
100. One of the problems that affected developing countries in their development efforts was the question of external indebtedness.
The question of the external debt of developing countries must be considered in realistic terms - including its possible cancellation - in order to balance the obligations of the debtor countries and their ability to sustain reform and growth.
It was now increasingly accepted that many developing countries could not service their external debt and at the same time set aside resources to fund the reforms and economic restructuring that were necessary in laying foundations for long-term sustainable development.
In that regard, he urged the Paris Club creditors to recognize that, for their initiative to have a positive impact, it was important to go beyond the Naples terms for the heavily indebted poor countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa.
The resources which could be used to promote the reform process and development were swallowed up by debt-servicing obligations.
101. The problems facing the commodity sector were of great concern to most developing countries. The international community must help correct the imperfections in the commodity markets and commit itself to supporting the commodity diversification programmes, including the establishment of financial mechanisms such as the proposed African diversification fund.
102. In June 1996, the international community adopted by consensus the Habitat Agenda, which clearly demonstrated the concern shared by all countries about containing the scourge of poverty and deprivation and offering new hope.
103. Achieving sustainable development and enhancing the environment were priority issues that affected economic growth and the well-being of peoples throughout the world.
The global environmental deterioration had been the result of unsustainable consumption patterns and production processes, especially in the industrialized countries, which were responsible for the greater proportion of pollutant emissions, including toxic and hazardous wastes.
The developed countries had the capacity and the main responsibility to combat the global impact of such pollution.
104. Desertification and drought were another impediment to the development process in many developing countries, particularly those in Africa.
The Convention to Combat Desertification, which 50 States had thus far signed and ratified, was a framework for joint action.
The importance of the Convention could not be overemphasized, especially since it recognized the link between desertification, energy needs and poverty and the fact that, in order to deal with the problem of desertification comprehensively, the international community must first address the underlying problem of poverty.
105. The mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, which had concluded the previous month, had showed that many of the critical social and economic problems that had led to the adoption of the Agenda still existed and had worsened in some countries.
The mid-term review had reaffirmed and underscored the mutuality of commitments and responsibilities as well as the need for urgent and concrete action on the part of Africa and the international community.
The New Agenda was a framework for a global partnership, which required collective political will in order to work.
In conclusion, he emphasized that for Africa to sustain recovery and growth, the developed countries should complement Africa's development efforts.
That could be done by reorienting a significant proportion of aid flows towards activities aimed at facilitating Africa's entry into the world economy.
106. Mr. ZULU (International Monetary Fund (IMF)) said that major decisions had been taken at the meetings at the end of September by the Interim Committee of the IMF Board of Governors, which played a strategic policy-making role in the institution by providing member countries with clearer guidance on the policy strategy of sustained growth with price stability and by underscoring the importance of transparency in the formulation and management of economic policies.
The first decision was linked to the issue of external debt.
In order to help solve that problem, IMF would provide the heavily indebted poor countries, within the framework of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, with grants or loans with extended maturities for debt servicing falling due to the Fund in order to reduce the current net value of that debt.
107. Another important step taken by the Interim Committee was the adoption of the Declaration on Partnership for Sustainable Global Growth.
The Declaration was both a reaffirmation of the Declaration on Cooperation to Strengthen the Global Expansion, adopted two years earlier, and recognition of the need to update and broaden the earlier initiative in order to include structural issues and in light of other new challenges in a changing global environment.
The Declaration on Partnership underscored that there was a need to provide well-targeted and affordable social safety nets by reducing unproductive spending, while ensuring adequate basic investment in infrastructure; that the sustainability of economic growth depended on the development of human resources; and that it was highly desirable to reform public pensions, employment insurance, social security and health systems in order to ensure their long-term viability.
In that new framework, the old dichotomy of characterizing structural adjustment programming as a concern only of developing countries was a thing of the past.
The Declaration also discussed ways to promote good governance in all aspects, including tackling corruption, ensuring sound banking systems, and curbing money laundering.
108. He wished to mention a few highlights from the exchanges among the participants at the Annual Meetings.
Firstly, it had been recognized that the relatively favourable economic situation was not a fortuitous outcome, but the product of many years of hard work and sacrifice in pursuit of sound economic policies at both the national and international levels.
Governors from both industrialized and developing countries had acknowledged the benefits of macroeconomic stability and structural reform, while others had highlighted issues such as the importance of investing in health and education, the role of such investments in increasing social equity, and the link between social equity and the sustainability of the reform process.
It had also been recognized that, ultimately, all countries were seeking similar goals and that each country therefore had a stake in the success of all the others.
109. With regard to the possibility of selling a limited amount of IMF gold, he said that the Fund's Executive Board was committed to securing, by means of the usual financing methods, the resources for financing the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility that were necessary in order to ensure its continuation and the Fund's participation in the initiative concerning the heavily indebted poor countries.
If the need arose and bilateral sources were exhausted, IMF must be prepared to optimize the use of its resources, which could entail the sale of some gold.
In any event, it was premature to say whether that need would arise since it would depend on the size of bilateral contributions and the rapidity with which potential recipient countries would seek assistance from that special fund.
110. In closing, he said that, although the current climate of stability and economic progress was promising, it would not be lasting unless it served to open opportunities for all persons and that the crucial link between economic and social development and the efforts to enhance the dignity of mankind made the Fund's work a truly meaningful task.
111. Mr. SFEIR-YOUNIS (World Bank) said that in 1996 the World Bank and the International Development Association (IDA) had together granted loans worth $21 billion divided among 256 projects.
Most of that amount had been earmarked for the electricity, transportation and agriculture sectors.
The Bank's lending programme was structured in three main areas: the first was investment in people and human resource development.
Over the past 10 years, that had been the area which had undergone the greatest growth, and the Bank had become the world's largest source of external financing for the development of human resources.
In 1996 that area had included loans worth $700 million for education and loans worth $2 billion for health care, and also new initiatives in the spheres of unemployment subsidies, the establishment and maintenance of social security networks and the promotion of equality between men and women in national and regional strategies.
112. Another important area of the World Bank's lending programme was projects designed to promote environmentally sound and socially sustainable development.
In 1996, $1.6 billion had been allocated to 20 new projects under that heading and since 1987 the Bank's lending programme in the sphere of the environment had grown to nearly $11 billion for 153 projects.
The composition of those loans had been changed to take into account the environmental consequences of rapid urban growth and a renewed commitment to the solution of environmental problems in rural areas.
114. On the question of debt, the World Bank, IMF and other donors had agreed on a programme to combat that problem.
Furthermore, the Development Committee had approved an instrument known as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund, which had a balance of $500 million.
Mechanisms had also been approved for using the Paris Club to take up issues of bilateral aid and related matters at the international level.
The Development Committee had also considered the increasingly broad functions of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
115. The question of poverty alleviation had been the subject of broad debate and a programme had been drawn up in that sphere which would have repercussions on gender issues and rural development during the next century.
116. Mr. WINNICK (United States of America) said that it was significant that attention was being paid to social development issues in the debates of IMF and especially its Interim Committee, which was a bastion of the international financial system.
In that respect, he asked what influence the work of the United Nations and, especially, a meeting like the World Summit for Social Development, had on the activities of IMF.
He also asked whether the representative of the World Bank could make available the document on the multilateral trust fund so that it could be circulated as a United Nations document and taken up by the Committee.
117. Mr. KERPENS (Suriname) and Mr. GRANT (Ireland) said that they supported the request that a document expanding on the information provided by the representative of the World Bank should be circulated among delegations.
118. Mr. OJIMBA (Nigeria) said that the representatives of IMF and the World Bank should be invited to make fuller statements to the Committee.
119. The CHAIRMAN said that because of time limitations and the need to allow the exercise of the right of reply, it had been necessary to limit the length of the statements by the representatives of IMF and the World Bank, but that an informal meeting would be arranged so that delegations could receive more information about the Bretton Woods institutions and, in particular, on the conclusions of the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and on those of the fund for the transfer of real resources to developing countries (Development Committee).
120. Mr. ZULU (International Monetary Fund), replying to the representative of the United States of America, said that over the past five years IMF had paid constant attention to the social dimension, and the World Summit for Social Development had simply added impetus to IMF activities in that sphere.
It had also carried out studies on income distribution, a new area in which IMF assigned important functions to the various sectors of society and ensured that the policies which were applied to countries took into account the income distribution situation in each case.
121. Mr. SFEIR-YOUNIS (World Bank) said that a document containing detailed information on the new multilateral trust fund was available to delegations.
122. Mr. BURHAN (Turkey), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that the Permanent Representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus would make an appropriate response to the comments made earlier at the meeting.
123. Mr. THEOPHYLACTOU (Cyprus), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that the person named by the previous speaker was not entitled to speak in the Committee, and that the entity he had mentioned was not recognized by any country except Turkey.
124. Mr. BURHAN (Turkey) said that the letter from the Permanent Representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus would be circulated as an official document of the United Nations.
125. Mr. THEOPHYLACTOU (Cyprus) said that the alleged republic was not recognized by any United Nations body, and referred to Security Council resolution 541 (1983) which called upon all States not to recognize any occupying regime in Cyprus.
The meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 9th MEETING
Chairman: Mr. HAMBURGER (Netherlands)
CONTENTS
AGENDA ITEM 98: OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
AGENDA ITEM 98: OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT (continued) (A/51/256, A/51/357 and A/51/391; A/51/208-S/1996/543 and A/51/462-S/1996/831)
1. Mr. ABDELLATIF (Egypt) endorsed the statement made at a previous meeting by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Operational activities for development, in which the United Nations had acquired vast experience, were an essential factor in economic and social development.
Unfortunately, fewer and fewer resources were being allocated for such activities.
His delegation was surprised that the Secretary-General had not submitted a report on the subject and expressed concern that the cuts in overall resources might affect the continuity and effectiveness of activities and the capacity of funds and programmes to carry out their mandates.
Everyone was aware of the pressing needs of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries of Africa, and of the need to support the development efforts of such countries, especially with a view to strengthening their capacity and alleviating the adverse impact of economic reform programmes on the most vulnerable sectors of the population, particularly women and children.
It was necessary to ensure the effective provision of such assistance to developing countries.
3. His delegation wished to stress the need to implement fully all the elements of General Assembly resolution 50/120 in a coherent manner.
Greater transparency was also needed with respect to the proposed reforms of the United Nations programmes and funds.
Such reforms should not be carried out without prior consultations with intergovernmental mechanisms.
4. The CHAIRMAN, referring to agenda item 98, drew the Committee's attention to a note by the Secretary-General (A/51/124-E/1996/44) containing the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) on the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU), entitled "United Nations system common premises and services in the field" (A/49/629; see also E/1996/43).
5. Ms. RANA (Nepal) endorsed the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Nepal had been one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Government of Nepal had enacted some laws in line with the provisions of the Convention and had finalized a national plan of action, which was already being implemented.
6. Nepal attached great importance to the work carried out by the United Nations development system in developing countries, despite diminishing resources.
Reform in United Nations development agencies, such as UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), was essential to bring about the efficient use of scarce resources at the country level.
The implementation of General Assembly resolution 50/227 had made it possible to avoid duplication in many areas.
However, the reforms must be implemented cautiously in order not to affect the most essential programmes such as poverty eradication, health and education.
In that connection, her delegation was concerned about the sharp decline in both official development assistance (ODA) and contributions to the core programmes of UNDP.
7. The programmes of action of recent major international conferences had provided basic guidelines on how to solve current problems.
In that regard, her delegation appreciated the creation of four different inter-agency task forces to oversee the coherent and coordinated application of cross-sectoral issues agreed upon at international conferences.
Following the Fourth World Conference on Women, her Government had established the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare.
In the area of poverty eradication, her Government was committed to expanding existing credit services, while in the area of education it had declared its goal of achieving universal literacy by the year 2000.
At the World Summit for Social Development, Nepal had pledged to continue to intensify and expand literacy programmes and promote a method of participatory development in all government initiatives and programmes.
8. In order to meet the goals of the World Summit and other international conferences, developing countries like Nepal looked forward to the financial and technical support of all donor countries and agencies.
Nepal sought social and economic development within a framework of political stability, freedom and justice.
While Nepal's citizens currently enjoyed multi-party democracy and fundamental human rights, it had not been possible to meet the high expectations of the people because the means and resources at Nepal's disposal were extremely limited.
9. Nepal's development plans were based on the premise that every citizen had the right to development.
Therefore, along with economic liberalization, Nepal was pursuing a development policy focused on people, especially on poverty eradication.
Her Government had been allocating an increasing portion of its budget to the areas of child and maternal health and welfare and other basic human services.
Her delegation also supported the resident coordinator system, which would increase the capacity of United Nations development agencies to operate in a more efficient and coordinated manner.
10. The situation of women in Nepal was particularly unsatisfactory. For that reason, the Government's eighth five-year plan for the period 1992-1997 placed special emphasis on improving the situation of women with a view to increasing their participation in the economy and their role in reducing Nepal's rate of population growth, which was essential if Nepal was to achieve a sustainable increase in production and economic growth.
11. The ninth five-year plan for the period 1997-2002 was currently being prepared.
The Government was making every effort to include women in the development process.
UNDP, UNIFEM, UNFPA, UNICEF and other development agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) were implementing special programmes in many areas to improve the situation of women and also to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare in national capacity-building.
Her Government was grateful to all those organizations.
In that regard, her Government was also conscious of the importance of the assistance of non-governmental organizations and the private sector, and always endeavoured to involve them in all social development activities.
12. Mrs. REBONG (Philippines) said that her delegation fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, in particular with respect to the critical importance of ODA for the operational activities for development of the United Nations system.
In that connection, the developing countries had repeatedly stressed the importance of available resources.
That was not the only area of concern: the proper functioning of the resident coordinator system, particularly at the field level, and closer cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions were also important.
13. The issue of resources for operational activities, however, was particularly important because, in the view of her delegation, if resources could not be increased on a predictable, continuous and assured basis, the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired, developing countries' development programmes would be jeopardized and, in the long run, international development cooperation would be affected.
The developing countries therefore believed that there should be a continuous dialogue on the issue in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.
Her delegation had hoped that some of the reports on operational activities that had been submitted to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in July 1996 or, at least, some oral reports on progress in implementing General Assembly resolution 50/120 could have been presented during the current session of the General Assembly.
14. In view of the disturbing decline in the level of ODA resources, a new approach was needed in order to ensure their more efficient utilization.
Such resources should be used to finance the development programmes of developing countries.
Activities relating to the implementation of resolutions on triennial policy reviews should not be financed from a trust fund. Her delegation was certain that the Trust Fund was constituted from resources that donor countries had earmarked for ODA, and it considered that such activities should be financed from the regular budget of the United Nations.
15. The Trust Fund for Case Studies in Operational Activities for Development should have been a temporary arrangement, and donor countries that had supported the Trust Fund should contribute instead to the core resources of the funds and programmes once the regular budget of the United Nations had taken over those activities.
That also applied to the activities, at the Headquarters level, of the Office of the Special Coordinator for Economic and Social Development.
Her delegation commended the work of that Office and the dedication of the Special Coordinator to his mandate and its worthy objectives.
However, funds for operational activities, which could have been added to the financing of development programmes at the field level, should not be used to finance the activities of the Special Coordinator.
16. The CHAIRMAN said that he believed that the Director of the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, at a meeting held on the previous day, had already addressed some of the issues raised by the representative of the Philippines.
17. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme) said that UNDP fully agreed with the view that it should improve its cooperation with the World Bank.
In fact, the UNDP Administrator and the President of the World Bank had already taken steps in that direction.
With regard to core and non-core funding, UNDP believed that co-financing should be a key aspect of development cooperation and that core resources were the lifeblood of UNDP operations.
Therefore, while UNDP welcomed the increase in contributions of non-core resources, it believed that core resources should remain central to UNDP activities.
18. With respect to the comments of the representative of the Philippines regarding the Office of the Special Coordinator for Economic and Social Development, which was headed by the UNDP Administrator, he said that the Administrator was supported by a very small unit, the Office of United Nations System Support and Services (OUNS), which was staffed by UNDP.
The Office played a key role, since coordination was essential to development cooperation.
He therefore agreed with the representative of the Philippines that resources and staff should be allocated to OUNS so that it could adequately provide its important services.
The Trust Fund covered small amounts, since most of the activities called for under the resolutions were carried out by the operational funds and programmes and agencies of the United Nations system, while the Fund was used only to carry out certain studies and prepare reports requested in the resolutions.
20. Mr. KABA (Guinea) endorsed the views expressed by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and said that the serious economic difficulties confronting the Organization had led to a considerable decline in ODA.
In future, more needs would have to be met and better results obtained with a constantly shrinking pool of resources; that was a matter of concern to developing countries such as Guinea, which had many pressing development needs.
It was clear that like all United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, States had to review the priorities of their programmes, plans and strategies in order to make the painful choices that were essential for adapting programmes to available means.
21. The African States were facing difficulties of all kinds in view of the many pretexts for making ODA, which had already been drastically reduced, conditional, and the stagnation or decline in UNDP core resources.
In such difficult times, the complex political climate in those States must be taken into account.
His delegation was convinced that operational activities for development could be strengthened through the harmonization and simplification of procedures and a more coherent definition of national priorities within the framework of the activities of United Nations bodies at the field level.
Operational activities for development should be periodically assessed in order to ensure that they met the needs of States' national objectives and priorities.
22. His delegation welcomed the decisions adopted at the recent Summit of the Group of Seven concerning the need to maintain adequate ODA funding and establish coordination in that area between the United Nations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions in order to harmonize and promote sustainable human development.
In cooperation with United Nations agencies and other development partners, Guinea had recently held a country workshop in Dalaba on a strategy for mobilizing and coordinating assistance for the period 1996-2001. The workshop had elaborated a strategy and planning note and a plan of action that required the support of the international community.
23. In view of the economic and institutional reforms undertaken by African States and the need for assistance to ensure the success of those reforms, Guinea pinned great hopes on the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa, which would put the solidarity of the international community to the test and would require African States and their international development partners to take an innovative, coherent and pragmatic approach.
24. Mr. ABDELLATIF (Egypt) requested clarification from the UNDP representative of some aspects of a report which outlined the reform process known as "UNDP 2001", in particular, whether the process had been approved by the UNDP Executive Board, what it involved, whether its scope would be regional or global, the nature of its relationship to the restructuring of the United Nations in the economic and social fields, and its prospects with regard to official development assistance and the provision of financial resources.
25. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme) said that the report referred to by the representative of Egypt was not an official document, but rather confidential, and that it had been prepared by the UNDP Administrator in response to a request from the Secretary-General to provide him with ideas on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields.
A review of the reforms currently under way would enable UNDP to implement more effectively the decisions already adopted by the Executive Board and to improve its management and work methods with a view to the next century.
26. The "UNDP 2001" reform process should not give cause for concern, since it was fully consistent with the current work of the organs and governing bodies of the United Nations, and did not involve any change in the functions of the Executive Board and the Economic and Social Council, respectively.
Notwithstanding the central role of UNICEF in the follow-up process, all United Nations development agencies should strengthen their mutual cooperation and incorporate implementation of the World Summit Declaration and Plan of Action in their respective programmes.
28. In that connection, the resident coordinator system should be strengthened at the field level and cooperation-oriented dialogue should be held more frequently among the United Nations development agencies, and between those agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.
The national programmes of action should be incorporated into national development plans and should form the basis for implementing joint development activities through country strategy notes.
30. Concerning resources for operational activities for development, his delegation attached great importance to official development assistance, in particular to the portion that was earmarked for the least developed countries and Africa, and supported the statement by the Group of 77 in that regard.
General Assembly resolution 50/227 provided valuable guidance in the search for new and innovative funding modalities, and his delegation hoped that the discussions among Member States would result in a more secure and effective funding mechanism.
31. Mr. KA (Senegal) expressed full support for the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. In the current context of scarce resources and an unprecedented increase in the amount of work expected of the Organization, the United Nations mandate in the area of operational activities for development must be improved.
Otherwise, executing agencies would be unable to fulfil the needs of beneficiaries effectively.
33. Moreover, the dialogue between the executive heads and teams in the field, held during the recent session of the Economic and Social Council, had highlighted issues which interfered with the smooth functioning of operational activities for development.
Innovative measures for harmonizing standards and procedures, administrative services and common premises, evaluation and monitoring were necessary in order to avoid the duplication of work.
His delegation believed that national human resources must be used more systematically.
In that connection, he referred to paragraph 78 of resolution 50/227, whose implementation would increase the transparency of those bodies and the legitimacy of their deliberations.
However, every effort must be made to ensure that the reform process did not mean budgetary reductions and the elimination of certain bodies; that would inevitably lead to the dismantling of the multilateral development cooperation mechanism to the detriment of the developing countries.
35. His delegation was convinced that, however comprehensive and relevant the reform process was, it would be futile unless the disturbing reduction in official development assistance was halted.
A solution to the financial crisis afflicting the United Nations must also be found as rapidly as possible.
36. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme), referring to the statement by the representative of Senegal, said that UNDP programmes were flexible, which had made the large-scale decentralization possible; for example, the resident representatives could approve projects up to the amount of $1 million in their respective countries.
UNDP currently had designated nine experimental centres, where the resident coordinators had increased power to approve projects.
38. Mr. ZARIE-ZARE (Islamic Republic of Iran) welcomed the fact that the item on the promotion and protection of the rights of children was included in the agenda of the General Assembly, and noted the tremendous strides made by the international community, from the adoption of the Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child of 1924 to the convening of the World Summit for Children in 1990, when 27 objectives aimed at ensuring the survival, development and protection of children to the year 2000 had been established.
39. Nonetheless, millions of children throughout the world were currently victims of poverty, hunger and sickness on a daily basis and were even exposed to the risk of being sold.
He noted discrimination even in those deplorable circumstances, for the burden was borne mainly by the girl-child.
The chief impediments to the implementation of plans and programmes for children were poverty and the lack of economic growth, particularly in the developing countries.
Economic exploitation as a result of extreme poverty, coupled with unstable family structures, led to an increasing number of divorces and undermined ethical and spiritual values.
The proper attention must therefore be focused on child-related issues in all United Nations forums where family issues were considered.
40. He stressed that urgent action must be taken in order to enable the United Nations bodies and agencies to implement the provisions of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and the Plan of Action for its implementation, and to respond to the needs of refugee children and internally displaced persons.
41. His delegation wished to request the Secretary-General to consider refugee children as one of the key beneficiaries of the World Summit and the Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s.
In that regard, measurable indicators and targets could be established.
Inter-agency collaboration should be strengthened and the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the issue of refugee and internally displaced children would be taken into account in the relevant policies and programmes of the United Nations system.
42. As a host to millions of refugees, his country had carried out many activities aimed at alleviating the hardships of the Afghan people inside and outside Afghanistan.
To that end, his Government had built hospitals and medical centres to provide treatment free of charge, offered educational programmes for Afghan students, provided medical training, had implemented a plan for the vaccination of 8 million children and provided the necessary services to orphanages as well as food and other assistance.
43. With respect to the situation of children in his country and his Government's policies in that regard, the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, had formulated a national plan of action which had been incorporated into the second five-year national development plan up to the year 2000 aimed at implementing the provisions of the Convention.
Considerable resources had already been allocated for that purpose.
44. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) had recognized his country's work for the benefit of children and had indicated in its report that the Islamic Republic of Iran would attain the goals set by the above-mentioned plan before the year 2000.
45. His delegation fully agreed that operational activities for development should be funded in a comprehensive manner.
However, solutions must be found to the financial difficulties bedevilling the funds and programmes of the United Nations.
The lack of political will and resolve had been the main cause of the failure of consultations on the modalities for funding operational activities during the past two years.
46. Mr. VAHER (United Nations Children's Fund) congratulated the Islamic Republic of Iran on the progress it had achieved towards the goals set by the World Summit for Children.
The treatment of refugee children was part and parcel of an inter-agency endeavour agreed on at that Summit.
UNICEF had signed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) a memorandum of understanding which accorded priority attention to the situation of children; it had signed another memorandum of understanding with the International Labour Organization (ILO) concerning the controversial issue of child labour.
47. Ms. SIBAL (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) said that there was a close relationship between the work of UNESCO in the area of basic education and the eradication of illiteracy and the work of the Organization.
Moreover, the collaboration of UNESCO with UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other bodies of the United Nations system, which had produced felicitous results at the World Conference on Education for All held at Jomtien in 1990 and the Education for All Summit of Nine High-Population Developing Countries held in New Delhi in 1993 was also worth mentioning.
48. UNESCO had organized a Mid-Decade Meeting of the International Consultative Forum on Education for All in Amman, in June 1996, which had showed the continued commitment to the principles embodied in the World Declaration on Education for All.
However, UNESCO had found that progress towards the achievement of the goal of universal primary education had been very uneven and that the gender gap was closing too slowly.
49. The UNESCO/UNICEF Joint Committee on Education had elaborated strategy guidelines on issues such as the education of girls and a more effective monitoring of the goals set by the Jomtien Conference and by the World Summit for Children.
The many guidelines set by that Committee had been reflected in the Medium-Term Strategy for the period 1996-2001 adopted in 1995 by the General Conference of UNESCO at its twenty-eighth session.
Such fruitful cooperation between UNESCO and UNICEF would encourage the two organizations to seek further synergy at the country level with their respective field offices.
50. On the threshold of the twenty-first century, almost one billion adults were still illiterate and over 130 million children of primary school age were denied their inalienable right to education.
There was a continuing need for innovative approaches and for strong political commitment on the part of Member States.
UNESCO continued to advocate increasing investment in education.
Six billion dollars a year would be sufficient to provide every child a place in primary school by the year 2000.
51. She highlighted the similarity between the ideas that had been put forward by the Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation at the Second Committee's 3rd meeting and the concept of the culture of peace being advocated by UNESCO.
A culture of peace addressed the root causes of conflicts through a long-term approach which promoted development, democracy, the full achievement of human rights and the transformation of values, attitudes and behaviours in order to promote non-violence and solidarity.
52. A culture of peace must be linked to development based on justice and the full exercise of democratic principles.
That required a wide range of actions at all levels, from the local to the global. National and regional programmes were needed as well as global formal and informal thematic education initiatives which reflected the everyday lives of people.
Lastly, she stressed the leading role played by education in the promotion of a culture of peace.
53. Ms. HOMANOVSKA (Ukraine) said that UNDP should continue to play a key role within the operational activities of the United Nations system. She welcomed the efforts of UNDP to adapt its activities to present realities, particularly the reorientation of its activities for the eradication of poverty, the advancement of women, the generation of the environment and the attainment of sustainable living conditions.
54. She commended UNDP for its work in preparing the latest edition of the Human Development Report, which explored the links between economic growth and human development.
55. However, it was unreasonable to use purchasing power parity for measuring the gross domestic product in international comparisons.
56. Moreover, she disagreed with the data published in the Report on Ukraine's education profile.
As had happened in previous editions of the Report, the data presented were completely different from those published in the national statistics and did not reflect the actual situation.
57. In her view, a set of measures aimed at developing initiatives for change specifically the introduction of new criteria for programming UNDP activities should be approved and supported.
In future, UNDP should develop a programme approach concept; upgrade a programme harmonization mechanism bearing in mind the economic priorities of the recipient countries; strengthen the monitoring and evaluation functions within its mandate in order to ensure a more efficient implementation of its programmes and projects; harmonize its actions and strengthen coordination with the World Bank and other partners of the Administrative Committee on Coordination.
58. Her delegation also advocated further decentralization of United Nations activities, in particular with a view to expanding the scope of the functions of country offices and providing them with access to relevant resources, information, knowledge and experience.
59. The strengthening of the resident coordinator system was of crucial importance in the process of reorganizing the entire United Nations system of operational activities.
At the same time, it was necessary to establish the organizational structures of the relevant bodies to meet the new requirements of international technical cooperation.
In that connection, her delegation welcomed the planned reduction of UNDP headquarters staff.
However, the central aspect of that issue was the simplification of the UNDP organizational structure, which would also have a positive impact on its functioning.
60. Lastly, operational activities must have adequate financial support.
It was therefore necessary to seek new sources and establish new mechanisms, including the effective involvement of the private sector.
61. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme), responding to the Ukrainian delegation, explained that the data on that country's education profile had not been prepared by UNDP; they had been supplied to UNDP.
He would inform his colleagues about that discrepancy.
62. The process of reducing the UNDP headquarters' staff had begun four years previously; thus far, some 600 posts had been eliminated mainly through attrition and offering early retirement packages, ensuring that the process did not cause considerable prejudice to the staff.
That policy's aim was to allocate the bulk of the Programme's resources to development cooperation activities and not to administrative costs.
UNDP had one of the best administrative costs/programme execution ratios.
63. Mr. SOEPRATO (Indonesia) said that General Assembly resolution 50/120 provided a more comprehensive framework for the integration of all the elements that made up the Organization's operational activities.
The core dilemma stemmed from the fact that there was a sharp decline in resources even as the need for technical assistance increased.
That regrettable trend included a 9 per cent reduction in UNDP core resources for 1996.
That situation had been compounded by the substantial decline in official development assistance, which had fallen by as much as 25 per cent over the past four years. Likewise, the commitments to the tenth replenishment of the International Development Association had not been fully met.
64. If that adverse situation persisted, the developing countries would find it increasingly difficult to meet their development goals and the ability of the United Nations development system to fulfil its mandate would be jeopardized.
At the same time, there was a danger that commitments agreed to at recent major international conferences might not be fully implemented.
While Governments were primarily responsible for mobilizing their own resources at the national level, developing countries could not alone pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.
They needed substantial increases in resources in order to ensure that their operational activities for development could progress on a continuous and assured basis.
65. He urged donor countries to fulfil their commitments and pledges not only in a spirit of partnership for development, but also with a view to strengthening the global economy, peace and stability throughout the world.
His delegation, which considered it extremely important to seek new and innovative funding, was of the view that collaboration and cooperation between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions should be further strengthened, without introducing conditionalities.
66. His delegation was grateful for the untiring efforts of the funds and programmes to improve their performance and to become more responsive to the needs of Member States.
In that context, he welcomed the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), including the convening of a conference on women, trade and sustainable livelihood, to be held in Bangkok in November of the current year, for the purpose of mainstreaming the gender perspective not only in the activities of the United Nations but also in activities at the national level.
67. Ms. LEBL (United States of America) said that over the past several years her country had been working with other Governments, the Secretariat and staff and management of the funds and programmes to create a United Nations that worked better and cost less, responded to crises more rapidly, and focused its efforts on important tasks that it was well suited to perform.
At the most recent Summit of the Group of Seven, the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations in economic and social development had been underscored, and it had been recommended that an intensive review of United Nations development activities should be undertaken in order to improve coordination, eliminate duplication of tasks and determine what activities should be consolidated with UNDP.
68. After noting that there had been some encouraging trends in the agencies carrying out operational activities and expressing the hope that they would share their experiences with a view to strengthening the reform of the system, she reviewed the work of some United Nations bodies and agencies.
69. UNDP, a pioneer in management and administrative reform, had actively worked to reduce its staff, especially at headquarters, increase accountability, and directly involve its employees in reform through the change management process.
It had also instituted a new programming process that put greater emphasis on performance in determining country allocations.
Her delegation supported the new programming arrangements and believed that they would lead to better designed, higher impact projects, from which lessons could be learnt to improve development programming across the board.
Recently, UNDP had signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to strengthen their relationship.
In that regard, close collaboration between the funds and programmes and the Bretton Woods institutions and other organizations in the United Nations system was critical to helping countries formulate and implement sustainable development strategies.
70. She welcomed the progress in revitalizing UNIFEM and supported the Fund's focus on economic and political empowerment for women.
However UNIFEM, as a small voluntary fund associated with UNDP, must be careful not to overextend itself or duplicate the work of the Division for the Advancement of Women or of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), with which it should coordinate its work in order to maximize the impact of money spent and ensure that all its activities were value-added priorities.
She encouraged UNIFEM to focus on projects that had a measurable impact and benefited women at the national and regional level, rather than a small group of women in a particular country.
71. UNIFEM seemed to enjoy a comparative advantage in working with non-governmental organizations on network-building and advocacy projects, such as helping women's groups to influence national policies.
Her delegation hoped to see UNIFEM build more of its projects on those strengths and was encouraged that it would be developing a strategy and a business plan that would better equip it to carry out its mandate.
72. Her delegation was impressed by the work which the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) had done to improve its evaluation and monitoring of projects.
It particularly appreciated the frank assessment of project strengths and weaknesses and hoped that the Fund would share its experience and methodology with its United Nations partners.
Impact evaluations and project designs that included testing of assumptions and well-defined success criteria must become a standard tool of United Nations funds and programmes in the twenty-first century.
73. Her delegation was pleased that UNFPA was providing more budget authority to country directors in the field, thereby improving efficiency.
74. UNICEF stood as one of the most dynamic examples of reform within the United Nations system.
Since a management study of UNICEF had been completed in 1994, the Fund had embarked upon a major and successful reform effort known as the Management Excellence Programme.
UNICEF had also improved its coordination with other United Nations agencies.
75. UNHCR had also launched an innovative reorganization process, known as Project Delphi.
Its new management structure was designed to rationalize and streamline headquarters functions in order to avoid duplication and more effectively support field operations.
76. In 1995, the World Food Programme (WFP) had combined the contributions of many of the world's governments to feed some 50 million people at risk, an achievement unprecedented in human history.
It had demonstrated a marked increase in efficiency by moving increasing tonnages of food without a proportionate rise in overheads.
The WFP financial management improvement project had enhanced controls in the field, reduced the backlog of field reports, integrated headquarters and field financial components and improved financial reporting to donors.
A series of new memorandums of understanding with UNHCR and key non-governmental organizations had also led to increased coordination and efficiency, resulting in less waste and more mouths fed at lower cost.
Greater coordination and sharpening of focus were needed throughout the system.
Her delegation recommended therefore that United Nations development agencies should make a concerted effort to foster communication and coordination among themselves, not only at the managerial level but also, and most importantly, at the desk officer level.
78. The Member States of the United Nations, for their part, must redouble their efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the resources already available to multilateral agencies involved in development.
The improved performance of those resources would generate immediate benefits for the people who so desperately needed their assistance, and better results would, in turn, attract increased contributions for the programmes that worked well.
79. Ms. HEYZER (Director, United Nations Development Fund for Women), responding to the questions raised by the United States representative concerning UNIFEM, said that the Fund was a strategic, catalytic agency whose work would be evaluated on the basis of its results, sustainability, impact and accountability.
80. UNIFEM was investing its scarce resources in areas where it enjoyed comparative advantages, with a view to bringing about changes in the system whose effects would be felt at all levels.
It had identified five areas of activity on which to focus its efforts: strengthening of women's organizations; possible changes in the building of partnerships; women's integration in development; implementation of experimental projects; and focusing on experience gained and the use of practices that had proved more successful.
81. UNIFEM was aware of the need to build strong partnerships within the United Nations system and was therefore working closely with the Division for the Advancement of Women and INSTRAW and studying the possibility of developing joint programmes, the details of which would be finalized when strategic plans were drawn up.
82. Mr. TALBOT (Guyana) associated himself with the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, reiterated his delegation's support for operational activities for development and expressed appreciation to UNDP and other funds, programmes and agencies involved in such activities for their efforts to deliver assistance and support.
At the same time, his delegation was concerned at the decline in official development assistance for funding long-term development activities.
83. His delegation supported the appeal made by the Associate Administrator of UNDP for increased contributions to bolster the Agenda for Change adopted by the Executive Board at its annual session in 1995.
Funding for operational activities, which came essentially from core resources, must be placed on a predictable, continuous and assured basis if the real impact of such activities on development was to be optimized.
84. Operational activities for development had acquired new significance as a result of the cycle of world conferences held in recent years which had dealt with issues that could not be left to the process of market-based development alone. The strengthening of public policy and, in some instances, legislative, regulatory and monitoring machinery in those areas was, therefore, of vital importance.
His delegation's view was that operational activities had a critical and catalytic role to play in support of public policy and action in implementation of the commitments assumed at the various conferences. Operational activities for development should focus on fostering capacity at the domestic level, and that required addressing in an interrelated manner the thematic issues which had been dealt with by the cycle of conferences.
85. Lastly, he emphasized, as had the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, that the critical and unique role of operational activities for development was to enable developing countries to take increasing responsibility for their own development.
Human resource development and capacity-building must therefore be critical priorities of United Nations operational assistance.
86. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme), replying to questions asked by the representative of Guyana, said that UNDP has established task forces both at headquarters and in its field offices, to deal with follow-up to the major world conferences that had been held in recent years under the auspices of the United Nations.
The lead agency in each case was the organization dealing directly with the issue involved.
For example, UNDP was directly responsible for matters arising from the World Summit for Social Development, because poverty eradication was among its primary objectives.
In that area UNDP was working together with the Bretton Woods institutions.
In individual countries the resident coordinators, who had overall responsibility for programme implementation, had established task forces and thematic groups in connection with each of the conferences, while, in the field, the representative of the agency directly concerned took the lead in promoting follow-up activities to each of the conferences.
87. In many cases organizations were set up in individual countries to make preparations for the country's participation in a given conference; often those organizations were subsequently involved in the planning of follow-up activities.
89. The United Nations, for its part, must ensure that the universality, neutrality and multilateral nature of assistance was respected, taking into account the priorities and requirements of the developing countries and in line with those countries' own development policies.
90. The countries of Latin American and the Caribbean needed the support and cooperation of the United Nations system to consolidate the positive results reflected in their basic development indicators.
They therefore expressed their great concern at the continuing decline in financial contributions to funds and programmes for development activities.
91. The countries of the Rio Group shared the view of UNDP that the Programme's resources should be focused on four areas of sustainable human development: poverty eradication, environment, the status of women and job creation.
In addition, greater and better use must be made of the capacity of national experts so that, through the use of available technology, the maximum return was obtained on resources employed and expectations were met to the fullest possible extent.
92. The Rio Group welcomed the agreements reached at the ninth session of UNCTAD and expressed gratitude to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the key player in the promotion of socially and environmentally sustainable industrial development on the eve of the twenty-first century, which was a basic condition for poverty eradication and the creation of productive employment.
93. The Rio Group supported the implementation of a programme approach in achieving a greater concentration of resources, since it allowed recipient countries and the specialized agency concerned to select and determine jointly the contributions which the agency would make, without ignoring specialized sectors which, by their nature, responded better to a more focused "project approach".
It was therefore necessary to carry out a triennial policy review of United Nations operational activities with a view to correcting errors and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
In that connection, the Rio Group supported efforts to delegate authority from the governing bodies of funds, programmes and specialized agencies to local offices. That would make it possible to establish a more fluid and less bureaucratic dialogue and find practical solutions to common problems.
95. The process of economic liberalization and globalization made it possible for development policies to be applied in all spheres of the complex economic, political and social system, but, at the same time, it constituted a challenge to officials to implement those policies. For that reason, the countries of the Rio Group were particularly concerned that the programmes of actions adopted at the various international conferences should be applied and translated into reality, as a clear signal of the changes that must take place in the United Nations with a view to improving its effectiveness.
96. Mr. OMOTOSO (United Nations Development Programme), replying to the representative of Bolivia, said that the resident coordinator system was consistent with the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the operational activities of the United Nations system, including resolutions 32/197, 44/211 and 5/120.
It was a matter now of improving the system and adjusting it to current realities.
The resident coordinator had to perform various tasks, including follow-up of international conferences sponsored by the United Nations. In the selection, supervision and training of coordinators, account was taken of the need to improve the effectiveness of the process.
Candidates were selected not only from among the staff of UNDP, but also from among staff of organizations affiliated with the Joint Consultative Group on Policy and the specialized agencies of the United Nations.
Among the resident representatives who were resident coordinators, many had extensive experience with issues relating to funds and programmes of the United Nations system.
97. As to the use of national technical capacity, it should be emphasized that the ultimate objective of UNDP, in line with the decisions of its Governing Council, was for project execution to be entrusted entirely to national personnel.
98. The countries in which programmes were being carried out had acquired broad experience in the field and the objective of UNDP was to increase and improve their capacity so that it could be utilized by the public and private sectors and by non-governmental organizations, the strengthening of whose capacity was also sought.
99. The CHAIRMAN announced that the Committee had thus completed its consideration of item 98.
The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 20TH MEETING
Chairman: Mrs. ESPINOSA (Mexico)
CONTENTS
AGENDA ITEM 105: REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES, QUESTIONS RELATING TO REFUGEES, RETURNEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS AND HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS (continued)
AGENDA ITEM 100: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE WORLD SOCIAL SITUATION AND TO YOUTH, AGEING, DISABLED PERSONS AND THE FAMILY (continued)
AGENDA ITEM 101: CRIME PREVENTION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE (continued)
AGENDA ITEM 158: QUESTION OF THE ELABORATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST ORGANIZED TRANSNATIONAL CRIME (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
AGENDA ITEM 105: REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES, QUESTIONS RELATING TO REFUGEES, RETURNEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS AND HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS (continued) (A/51/12 and Add.1, A/51/206-S/1996/539, A/51/329, A/51/341, A/51/367 and A/51/454)
Mr. SCHATZER (Director for External Relations, International Organization for Migration (IOM)) said that IOM shared many of the problems of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and that over recent years cooperation between the two organizations had grown, to the benefit of people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Examples of the results of such cooperation were the return of refugees and internally displaced persons as a consequence of the Mozambique peace process and IOM activities carried out in the area of the former Yugoslavia.
Unfortunately, the outcome of inter-agency cooperation in the Great Lakes region had been less satisfactory, for reasons beyond the humanitarian agencies' control.
Safe and cost-effective transport was only one element of a repatriation exercise; reintegration into society was a complex process, and an early link must be established between humanitarian relief, rehabilitation measures and long-term development, but implementation of that concept called for yet greater cooperative efforts among all the organizations and agencies concerned.
IOM, which was an active participant in the activities of a number of entities in the United Nations system, was seeking to cooperate with other multilateral agencies and, increasingly, non-governmental organizations.
An example of that approach was the conference of the countries of the Community of Independent States (CIS), organized by UNHCR, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and IOM to discuss the complex migration and displacement problems in the CIS region.
A comprehensive strategy had been devised at the Conference, which was embodied in the Programme of Action, and IOM, in partnership with UNHCR, had developed a joint operational strategy that would constitute the framework for future cooperation in the region.
Another important element of the work carried out by IOM was technical cooperation; providing assistance in dealing with migration issues had many facets, from human-rights and refugee legislation to information management and integration measures.
The IOM technical cooperation centre had been set up for that purpose, and would help to develop complementary migration policy measures.
Moreover, there were countries that, in addition, had to solve the problems of both forced and voluntary migrants, whose predicament was not among the priorities for national resource allocation.
In such cases, the countries concerned needed financial support in order to solve problems that might otherwise give rise to political instability.
For such migrants, return was often the only alternative to detention or continued illegality.
IOM programmes in a growing number of countries enabled such people to return in safety and dignity.
In June 1996, the Director-General of IOM and the Secretary-General of the United Nations had signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement.
In the wider framework of cooperative arrangements with the United Nations, the partnership between IOM and UNHCR stood out both because of its duration and because of the number of joint initiatives undertaken. The conclusion of a memorandum of understanding with UNHCR was therefore a priority for IOM.
Mr. BIGGAR (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the European Union, and the associate countries of Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, and, in addition, Iceland, said that the absence of any large-scale repatriation so far both in the former Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region underlined the continuing need for a durable solution to the problems of refugees and the internally displaced.
The upsurge in conflict in Kivu, with massive movements of populations, threatened the stability of the entire Great Lakes region.
The European Union, which was in close contact with UNHCR, strongly supported UNHCR efforts in consultation with the countries of the region to achieve conditions that would allow the refugees to return to their homes in security and with dignity.
The Union stood ready to play its part in arriving at a comprehensive regional plan for voluntary repatriation and called upon the international community to exercise its responsibilities.
The European Union wished to emphasize the need for a regional conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region, under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
The Special Envoy of the European Union would coordinate closely with the recently appointed Special Envoy of the Secretary-General in efforts to resolve peacefully the current situation in the region.
The European Union welcomed the recognition of the importance of the human rights field operations set up by UNHCR in Rwanda and Burundi in establishing a secure environment for the return of refugees and internally displaced persons. Full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must underpin any successful solution to their problems. The Union called for an early resumption of the dialogue between the authorities of Zaire and Rwanda.
In the former Yugoslavia, the hopes that the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina had inspired for the early return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes had yet to be realized.
The operation plan elaborated by UNHCR in 1996 remained the basis for a durable solution in the area in question.
The European Union believed that the successful holding of elections, continuing peace based on the peace accords, and the ongoing rehabilitation activities to which the Union was a major contributor would encourage large-scale return.
The Union called again on all parties to the peace accords to ensure full implementation of their provisions.
It also remained concerned at the situation in Eastern Slavonia.
There were signs of progress in Mozambique, Central America and South—East Asia, and the European Union commended UNHCR for the outcome to the situations in question.
The situation in parts of the Horn of Africa also represented a measure of progress, although refugees continued to be a burden on host countries.
Damage to the environment in those countries of asylum should be addressed by the international community as part of its overall response.
In the CIS region, the Plan of Action recently adopted at the Regional Conference to address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees, held in Geneva, which was being implemented under the guidance of UNHCR, ICM and a CIS steering group, was a valuable contribution to a comprehensive solution based on prevention and interregional cooperation.
The European Union believed that relief, rehabilitation and development must be closely linked in order to respond to refugee problems.
Complex emergencies had also shown that peace-keeping, peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction, and respect for human rights and the rule of law were integral elements of viable solutions.
Greater collective efforts must be made to guarantee security and political stability in situations where humanitarian needs were being addressed, especially those involving women and children.
The European Union welcomed the efforts made by UNHCR to implement the Beijing Platform for Action at the field level, particularly those related to its training programme for gender issues, the strengthening of its existing policies and guidelines on refugee women, and the establishment of criteria and guidelines on responses to persecution specifically aimed at women.
The Union also commended the continuing efforts of UNHCR focused on the protection of refugee children, as well as the joint activities being undertaken by UNHCR and the United Nations Children's Fund within the framework of the 1996 Memorandum of Understanding.
The Union condemned the serious violations of the rights of refugees and displaced persons, including murder, rape and sexual violence. Governments and other parties to conflict must ensure that UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies could perform their tasks without hindrance.
The European Union, through its member States and the European Commission, was the most important donor to UNHCR programmes, contributing more than 50 per cent of the agency's total funding. The Union's contributions were a tangible recognition that the plight of refugees meant that international solidarity and support were required.
The Union therefore called once again for a broadening of the donor base, so that durable solutions could be implemented.
Mr. GARCÍA MORITÁN (Argentina) praised the work which UNHCR was carrying out in the field and welcomed the reforms undertaken within the Office, as they would help to provide an appropriate response to refugee crises and to find more efficient and less costly ways to give assistance.
With regard to progress in the reception of refugees in Latin America, he said that Argentina had traditionally been a place of refuge and therefore followed with interest developments in that sphere.
Further to the San José Declaration on Refugees and Displaced Persons, which addressed the harmonization of criteria and procedures for finding durable solutions, numerous seminars had been held in South America to improve existing legislation on refugees, and national institutions had been strengthened as a result.
South America had also responded positively to the High Commissioner's request that it should take in refugees from Europe; that request had, however, not yet been acted upon owing to factors beyond the control of the Governments in the region.
The Government of Argentina was committed to international humanitarian cooperation, such as the promotion of an international network for voluntary assistance in humanitarian emergencies and the "White Helmet" initiative.
As the refugee problem primarily affected developing countries, it was necessary to keep in mind the burden it imposed on those countries and to make use of the experience gained from South-South exchanges when organizing assistance and rehabilitation activities; the affinity between such countries tended to be greater than that between countries of origin and receiving countries.
For that reason, Argentina viewed with concern the decision to transfer the UNHCR regional office from Buenos Aires.
It did not seem reasonable to locate all three regional offices for the Americas, including South America, in the northern hemisphere.
The decision could not be justified on the basis of budget savings either, given the minuscule budget of the Buenos Aires office.
Moreover, the decision could have direct consequences for the channels of cooperation that had been open for more than 31 years and, in his country's view, should not have been made solely on the basis of forecasts that conflicts would be absent but rather should have taken account of the opportunities for cooperation afforded to UNHCR and the commitment of the regional office to the solutions it could provide.
Mr. TESSEMA (Ethiopia) said that the situation of refugees had worsened throughout the world.
In Africa, the conflict in Liberia had plunged the country into misery and turned a significant portion of its population into refugees; the situation in the Great Lakes region had worsened, particularly as a result of recent events in Burundi and Zaire; and the refugee problem in the Horn of Africa was still critical.
Africa harboured the largest number of refugees in the world (30 per cent of the world total); eight of the top ten refugee source countries in the world were in Africa.
African countries had shown generosity in assisting refugees over the years, but their financial and material capacities were limited. The countries of asylum were among the world's poorest; influxes of refugees had a serious impact on their economic, social and ecological conditions and even affected their peace and stability.
Countries which had accepted refugees for long periods were becoming increasingly fatigued.
The politization and, in some cases, the militarization of refugee camps was of increasing concern. Having lost the protection of their own countries, refugees should not be subjected to intimidation by political groups and others forms of coercion.
Despite such difficulties, UNHCR had undertaken praiseworthy activities in Africa, as, for example, in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola.
The continued support of donors and the international community was essential to alleviate the burden which UNHCR shouldered for the provision of assistance, and the United Nations humanitarian and development agencies should also cooperate closely with UNHCR.
In that connection, the efforts of UNHCR to coordinate its activities with other United Nations agencies in responding to humanitarian emergencies, such as that in the Great Lakes region, deserved much credit.
Since in many cases the refugee problem stemmed from conflicts, it was necessary to prevent conflicts and address their root causes.
Countries of origin, countries of asylum and the international community must take concerted measures with regard to conflict prevention, preventive diplomacy, democracy-building and economic development.
To that end, Ethiopia reiterated its support for the efforts being made by the countries concerned and by UNHCR to identify comprehensive and regional strategies for preventing refugee outflows.
The most appropriate solution for the current crisis was to encourage the voluntary return of refugees to their places of origin.
Nevertheless, for such repatriation to be sustainable it was necessary for all parties affected to take concerted action.
On the one hand, the countries of origin had to take measures to secure peace and stability, establish democracy and protect the human rights of all their citizens.
On the other, the countries of asylum had to eliminate all actions that could deter refugee repatriation.
Voluntary repatriation also depended in large part on the economic and social conditions in the countries of origin, so it would be necessary to provide such countries with refugee repatriation and reintegration assistance.
Ethiopia continued to be the epicentre of constant refugee movements in the Horn of Africa.
Over the previous five years, more than 2.5 million people had entered the country, and although that number had recently diminished, Ethiopia was still sheltering 347,000 refugees from neighbouring countries, especially Somalia and the Sudan.
In addition, nearly 1.1 million Ethiopians had been repatriated since 1991 as peace and stability returned to the country, and many more were expected to return.
The Ethiopian Government, with the assistance of UNHCR, was doing what it could to rehabilitate and reintegrate those refugees.
Nevertheless, that rehabilitation assistance was inadequate as Ethiopia was still in the reconstruction phase following the civil war. Ethiopia therefore called for additional funds to assist UNHCR repatriation activities.
Mr. AL-HITTI (Iraq) said that the responsibility for solving the problem of refugees and displaced persons rested with the international community.
He praised the work undertaken by UNHCR throughout the world to protect refugees, alleviate their sufferings and assist them in rebuilding their lives.
Iraq was also affected by the refugee problem because, as indicated in the High Commissioner's report (A/51/12), a large number of Iraqis had sought refuge in neighbouring countries.
That was a new situation for Iraq, which had always been a country that welcomed refugees from other countries.
That outflow had been caused by the exceptional circumstances created by the embargo that had been imposed on the country.
Although Iraq was fully implementing all United Nations resolutions, it continued to suffer the devastating effects of the sanctions.
The situation was aggravated by the war in the northern part of the country, which had triggered the exodus of thousands of Iraqis to neighbouring countries.
Interference in Iraq's internal affairs must stop in order to allow the Government to secure peace and stability and encourage the return of refugees.
An especially serious problem was the outflow of the labour force, particularly of skilled workers.
His delegation called on the international community to take the effects of the embargo into account and to take measures to mitigate the arbitrary sanctions against Iraq, as there was no longer any reason to maintain the embargo.
Moreover, the Economic and Social Council should study the relationship between development and the problem of migrations.
It was important for the developed countries to help developing countries meet their needs and develop their endogenous capacity.
Mr. LAVOYER (International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)) said that the mandate of ICRC was to provide protection and assistance, without discrimination, to populations in armed conflicts.
ICRC was currently carrying out activities on behalf of a large number of persons displaced within their own countries, especially on the African continent, in the Caucasus, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
In addition to its operational activities, ICRC contributed to the discussion of legislation concerning refugees.
He noted the high quality of the compilation and analysis of legal norms for the protection of internally displaced persons, presented by the representative of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights.
Like the Secretary-General, ICRC believed that existing international law provided sufficient protection to internally displaced persons.
Nevertheless, some aspects of that protection should be made clearer, such as repatriation under safe conditions and the restitution of property.
The problem stemmed not so much from the lack of rules as from the fact that rules pertaining to humanitarian law or to human rights law were not applied.
Therefore, it was essential in peace time to provide members of the armed forces with training in humanitarian law and to enact domestic legislation to punish war criminals.
Although the Geneva Conventions had been universal for a long time and 188 States were parties to them, more States should become parties to the Additional Protocols.
Wider awareness of and greater compliance with such law should lead to a decrease in the number of displaced persons.
In that regard, the importance of the Regional Conference to Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Relevant Neighbouring States, whose Programme of Action dealt with the prevention of population displacement, should be stressed.
ICRC supported that Programme of Action and would cooperate with UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
In addition to the issue of prevention, the Conference had considered the coordination of humanitarian activities, which should be carried out in the field on the basis of simple and flexible mechanisms and taking into account the resources of the various organizations.
However, ICRC must be able to maintain its independence if it was to fulfil its mandate.
Mention should be made in that connection of the ongoing dialogue between ICRC and UNHCR at the field and headquarters levels.
Humanitarian activities should combine emergency relief with rehabilitation and development efforts.
For its part, ICRC was doing its utmost to help the populations affected to be self-sufficient; accordingly it focused its programmes on improving health, reviving agricultural activities, distributing fishing tackle, vaccinating livestock and meeting other needs.
The best solution to the crisis was the return of displaced persons and the repatriation of refugees.
In order to ensure the voluntary return of such persons to their countries, Governments should establish structures for their reception, create a climate of security and provide the returnees with accommodation.
Moreover, measures should be taken to ensure the functioning of an independent judicial system, the restitution of property and the payment of compensation.
Mr. HABIYAREMYE (Rwanda), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, referred to the statement made by the representative of Zaire on the political and humanitarian crisis affecting the Great Lakes region.
It was incumbent on Zaire to end the suffering of its population and of refugees from Rwanda.
In using Rwanda in order to internationalize its internal conflict, Zaire was jeopardizing the stability of Rwanda and of the region.
Zaire was using refugees from Rwanda in order to divert the attention of the international community from its current political crisis.
In that connection, Rwanda wished to draw Committee members' attention to document S/1996/869, which contained a short synopsis of the background and history of the current events which had led to the crisis in eastern Zaire.
As for the attacks which the representative of Zaire had levelled against Rwanda, he noted that, in October 1995, the President of Rwanda had received a prize from the Centre for Human Rights for having checked the genocide in Rwanda and for his outstanding overall conduct as a champion of the United Nations following the withdrawal of UNAMIR.
Concerning non-governmental organizations, the representative of Zaire should be requested to count the non-governmental organizations present in Rwanda, which numbered over 100.
Rwanda would continue to respect the Charter and principles of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but it would also continue to defend its people and its borders as long as the situation of the refugees from Rwanda continued to be a source of concern to its Government.
Rwanda called once again for assistance to its persecuted people.
As for the regional conference, it believed that any internal problems of Zaire should be resolved internally.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.4
The Chairman announced that the draft resolution had no programme budget implications and that Bangladesh, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria and Myanmar had become sponsors.
Ms. NEWELL (Secretary of the Committee) read out a number of revisions to the draft resolution.
In the fourth and fifth lines of the third preambular paragraph of the English text, the words "increasingly provide" should be replaced with the words "are increasingly providing".
In the first line of paragraph 5, the words "within existing resources" should be added after the words "the Secretary-General".
Ms. ENKTSETSEG (Mongolia), speaking on behalf of the sponsors of the draft resolution, said that in paragraph 2 (b), after the words "to engage", the words "on a voluntary basis" should be inserted. In the second line of paragraph 5, after the words "fifty-fourth session", the words "through the Commission on Social Development" should be inserted and, at the end of that paragraph, the words "bearing in mind possible measures to improve the reporting procedure" should be added. She announced that Burkina Faso, Cuba, Estonia, Guinea, Honduras, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mali, Pakistan, the Sudan and Thailand had joined in sponsoring the draft resolution, and expressed the hope that it would be adopted by consensus.
The CHAIRMAN said that she would take it that the Committee wished to adopt the draft resolution, as orally revised, without a vote.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.4, as orally revised, was adopted.
AGENDA ITEM 101: CRIME PREVENTION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE (continued) (A/C.3/51/L.2, A/C.3/51/L.6 and A/C.3/51/L.8)
The CHAIRMAN announced that draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.2, entitled "Action against corruption", had no programme budget implications and that the Economic and Social Council, by its resolution 1996/8, had recommended to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft resolution.
Ms. NEWELL (Secretary of the Committee) read out a revision to draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.2 proposed by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
The fourth preambular paragraph should read as follows:
"Convinced of the need to provide, upon request, technical assistance designed to improve public management systems and enhance accountability and transparency,".
The Spanish-speaking countries had also requested that in the Spanish version the words "en última instancia" in the third line of paragraph 1 of the annex be replaced with the words "ante todo".
The CHAIRMAN said that she would take it that the Committee wished to adopt the draft resolution as orally revised.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.2, as orally revised, was adopted without a vote.
Mr. MEKDAD (Syrian Arab Republic) welcomed the adoption of the draft resolution; however, he wished to make the following three comments.
Firstly, he thanked the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice for the revision it had proposed to the fourth preambular paragraph which, in its present wording, seemed to apply only to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition.
Secondly, it was not clear what was meant by the implementation plan referred to in paragraph 5. He would have preferred the following wording: "a plan proposed by the States concerning the fight against corruption".
Lastly, the definition of public office under the International Code of Conduct for Public Officials (annex to the draft resolution) was not complete and did not have the meaning that it was usually given under domestic legislation.
In his view, the definition should be "a public office, irrespective of its definition under domestic law, involves the duty to act primarily in the public interest, as defined by national law".
He had referred to that particular aspect because the definition of public office was not the same in every country.
While his delegation had joined in the consensus, it wished to stress that documents of such importance should be drafted with greater precision. That could be achieved by pursuing a broader democratic dialogue, accommodating all viewpoints and giving those countries that had not participated in the discussion of a draft resolution the opportunity to express their views.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.6
The CHAIRMAN announced that draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.6, entitled "United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders", had no programme budget implications.
Ms. NEWELL (Secretary of the Commission) read out the proposed revisions to the draft resolution.
In the third line of paragraph 3, the words "fulfil its mandate" should be added after the words "to enable it" and the rest of the paragraph should be deleted.
A new paragraph should be inserted, following paragraph 4, which would read as follows:
"5. Also requests the Secretary-General to enhance regional cooperation, coordination and collaboration in the fight against crime, especially in its transnational dimensions, which could not be adequately dealt with by national action alone;".
The following paragraphs must be renumbered accordingly.
Mr. WISSA (Egypt) said that, ordinarily, when changes of that magnitude -i.e., introducing a new paragraph in a resolution - were made, all the sponsors were consulted. His delegation had not been consulted concerning those revisions.
Mr. NDIKUMANA (Burundi) requested the indulgence of delegations which had not been officially consulted on the proposed revisions and said that the draft text was not much different from the one adopted the previous year.
He pointed out that the first line of paragraph 6 should read "make every possible effort" instead of "make every effort".
The CHAIRMAN said that, if she heard no objection, she would take it that the Committee wished to adopt the draft resolution, as orally revised, without a vote.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.6, as orally revised, was adopted without a vote.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.8
The CHAIRMAN said that draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.8, entitled "Strengthening the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, particularly its technical cooperation capacity", had no programme budget implications, and that Argentina, Armenia, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, Georgia, Guatemala, Romania, the Russian Federation, Spain and Tunisia wished to become sponsors.
"Convinced of the desirability of closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating crime, including drug-related crimes, such as terrorist crimes, illicit arms trade and money-laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect,".
Mr. BUSACCA (Italy) said that Australia, the Bahamas, Cape Verde, Malta and Togo had joined the sponsors.
Mr. MEKDAD (Syrian Arab Republic) agreed with the representative of Egypt that completely new paragraphs should not be introduced; the situation warranted a request to defer the vote.
Mr. BUSACCA (Italy) said that the paragraph under discussion had been submitted together with the draft resolution.
The CHAIRMAN announced that Burundi, Chile, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, the Marshall Islands and the Philippines had joined the sponsors of the draft resolution. If she heard no objection, she would take it that the Committee wished to adopt the draft resolution as orally revised.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.8, as orally revised, was adopted without a vote.
Mr. SHAPIRO (United States of America) said that, while his delegation had joined the consensus on draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.8, it believed that the phrase "the inclusion of the re-establishment and reform of criminal justice systems in peacekeeping operations" at the end of paragraph 10 might be appropriate in the mandates of certain peacekeeping operations, but not in others.
In fact, the Security Council should decide whether to include it on a case-by-case basis.
The presence of the phrase in the draft resolution could lead to the erroneous conclusion that all peacekeeping operations should include re-establishment and reform of criminal justice systems, and that was not so.
It was to be hoped that, in future, that would be taken into consideration and that the wording of resolutions would state that the Secretary-General recommended such an inclusion to the Security Council, where appropriate.
AGENDA ITEM 158: QUESTION OF THE ELABORATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST ORGANIZED TRANSNATIONAL CRIME (continued) (A/C.3/51/L.10)
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.10
The CHAIRMAN, introducing the draft resolution entitled "Question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized transnational crime", said that it did not have programme budget implications, and that Austria, Belarus, Croatia, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea wished to join the sponsors.
Ms. NEWELL (Secretary of the Commission) said that the following oral revisions had been introduced to the draft resolution: in paragraphs 1 and 2, the words "Member States" should be replaced by the words "all States".
Mr. LUKASIK (Poland) said that Belgium, Cape Verde, the Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United States of America and Uruguay wished to join the sponsors.
The CHAIRMAN said that Slovakia, too, wished to become a sponsor.
Draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.10, as orally revised, was adopted without a vote.
The meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 23RD MEETING Chairman: Mrs. ESPINOSA (Mexico)
CONTENTS
AGENDA ITEM 105: REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES, QUESTIONS RELATING TO REFUGEES, RETURNEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS AND HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS (continued)
AGENDA ITEM 105: REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES, QUESTIONS RELATING TO REFUGEES, RETURNEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS AND HUMANITARIAN QUESTIONS (continued) (A/51/12 and Add.1, A/51/206-S/1996/539, A/51/329, A/51/341, A/51/367, A/51/454)
Mr. GHEBREMARIAM (Eritrea) said that one of the most daunting challenges Eritrea had faced when it had declared its sovereignty in 1993, while the country was in a state of extreme poverty and devastation, had been the repatriation, mostly from the Sudan, and reintegration into society of tens of thousands of refugees.
To deal with that challenge, it had established the Commission for Eritrean Refugee Affairs.
Within that context, a dialogue had been established with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the modalities of repatriation.
However, the parties had taken different positions on the issue.
Eritrea had proposed that organized repatriation and reintegration of refugees should be viewed as a continuous process within the overall rehabilitation and development of the country, while UNHCR believed that its role should be limited to repatriation and that other agencies should handle reintegration and development.
In 1993, an inter-agency donor joint mission had reviewed and revised the programme, with the participation of UNHCR and the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs.
The Programme for Refugee Reintegration and Rehabilitation of Resettlement Areas in Eritrea had been adopted for implementation in three phases, to be concluded in 1997.
With a budget of $262.2 million, its twofold objective was to assist in the repatriation of refugees from the Sudan in an organized manner and to ensure their social and economic integration once they arrived in their home country.
Given how complex that task was for a devastated economy like Eritrea's, the Government had appealed for assistance to the international donor community.
The pledging conference held in Geneva, however, had not met with the expected response.
Nevertheless, the Government of Eritrea had continued its efforts, and in April 1994 it had signed an agreement with UNHCR for the execution of a pilot project to begin in November 1994 for the repatriation of 25,000 persons at a total cost of $13.5 million.
The project was successfully completed in May 1995.
It had been hoped that the pilot project would be a prelude to the first phase of a resettlement programme that would accommodate 100,000 refugees beginning in December 1995.
The Government of Eritrea had accorded top priority to the plight of refugees in the Sudan because of the major social, political and economic hardship they had been forced to endure for so long.
Although the brotherly hospitality the Sudanese people had offered to Eritrean refugees over three decades must be acknowledged, it was no secret that the refugees had been subjected to maltreatment, restrictions and abuse.
There was no alternative to voluntary repatriation, but that operation could not take place because of obstacles raised by the Government of the Sudan.
The Government of the Sudan had concluded a similar agreement with UNHCR in September 1994.
However, during the course of the pilot project in 1995 the Sudanese authorities had hampered the process, in violation of the fundamental principles governing the rights of refugees and in contravention of that country's obligation to cooperate with UNHCR in discharging its mandate.
Weary of waiting for an organized repatriation, over 140,000 Eritrean refugees had spontaneously returned from the Sudan without the necessary legal protection and safety assurances.
Eritreans remaining in the Sudan had been denied access to survival food rations and other basic services as a result of restrictions placed on the movement and delivery of such provisions.
The Government of Eritrea had brought the widespread human rights abuses to the attention of UNHCR.
The welfare of some 300,000 Eritrean refugees was being endangered by the non-compliance of the Sudanese authorities with the humanitarian principles of the international conventions to which they were party.
Voluntary repatriation had been frustrated because the Sudanese Government had refused to respect the agreement reached with UNHCR.
Eritrea believed that the international community, and particularly UNHCR, had a legal and moral responsibility to guarantee respect for humanitarian principles.
The Office must not remain a passive observer to the obstacles put in its way in fulfilling its mission to protect the refugees.
The Government of Eritrea pleaded with the United Nations and its Member States to adopt tangible measures to guarantee that hundreds of thousands of Eritrean refugees would not become victims of certain political and economic objectives.
He wished to refute the usual allegation by the Sudanese authorities that the Government of Eritrea was selective and discriminated against different social groups and political factions in its repatriation programme. Even more outrageous was the accusation that Eritrean refugees were taking Sudanese nationality because of discrimination by the Government of Eritrea.
Those were baseless fabrications devised by the Sudanese National Islamic front to mislead the international community about its obstructive posture to seek, in a desperate attempt, to legitimize the recruitment of young Eritreans to participate in the jihad movement against Eritrea.
The truth was that the Government of Eritrea had given full responsibility and freedom to UNHCR to organize the entire operation in the Sudan, in accordance with the Office's criteria for setting priorities.
Ms. MUTAI (Kenya) said that Kenya was perturbed by the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region, which had exacerbated the plight of the refugees in that part of Africa.
It believed that the problem was essentially a political one and that the solution must also be political.
Kenya hoped that the regional summit which was scheduled to be held in Nairobi on 5 November 1996 would provide the necessary impetus for a lasting and comprehensive solution to the problems of the region.
Her delegation believed that those efforts together with those being undertaken by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative were complementary and mutually reinforcing, particularly with regard to the stated objectives of developing plans to defuse tensions, achieve a cease-fire and pave the way for negotiations within the framework of the regional conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region.
Countries of asylum in the region were excessively burdened by the huge inflows of refugees, returnees and displaced persons, which had contributed to the social and economic instability of those countries.
It was a source of concern to note that the patience of donor countries was beginning to wear thin.
She wished to take the opportunity to urge those countries which had consistently funded the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to continue to provide assistance, even in situations of great financial difficulties.
The Kenyan delegation welcomed the initiative taken by UNHCR to implement small community-based assistance programmes to pave the way for repatriation and resettlement and to accelerate the rehabilitation process.
She was gratified by the active support of UNHCR for the efforts being made by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and hoped that that support would play a decisive role in peace-building as a precondition for subregional stability, security and sustainable socio-economic development.
The Kenyan delegation shared the view expressed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) that any voluntary repatriation in the Great Lakes region would prove futile unless serious attempts were made to separate the bona fide refugees from the armed elements and to assure them some degree of security, build their confidence and facilitate their safe return to their countries of origin.
Kenya wished to reaffirm its strong and unwavering support for UNHCR and its efforts to comprehensively consider, review and resolve the problems of refugees, returnees and displaced persons, as well as related migratory movements and appealed to the international community to continue to support that important United Nations agency.
It was paradoxical that during a period of general relaxation of tensions following the end of the cold war, it had not been possible to achieve greater international cooperation to promote socio-economic development and improve the qualify of life of all peoples.
Instead, the international community had had to increasingly concentrate its resources and time on addressing the humanitarian needs of the victims of crises resulting from natural or man-made disasters, which were mainly inter-State conflicts.
Such conflicts pointed to the urgent need for concerted international efforts to find lasting solutions that addressed the root causes of the conflicts.
The tragic developments currently unfolding in Zaire highlighted the urgent need for international measures to avert another humanitarian catastrophe in that region.
According to UNHCR, Africa was home to the largest refugee population in the world.
Regrettably, the mass migration was the result of internal strife in many countries.
With the signing of the Abuja Agreement in Nigeria in 1995, the international community had hoped that the Liberian conflict would shortly be resolved, because, for the first time, the leaders of the warring factions had been included in the governing Council of State.
The outbreak of fighting in April of 1996 with the attendant looting, destruction and killings had dealt a major blow to the peace process.
The new Abuja Agreement, signed in August 1996, revised the timetable for the implementation of the peace Agreement, which would permit the holding of democratic elections in 1997.
According to the revised timetable, the process of disarmament and demobilization of combatants was to begin by the end of the current month.
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Nine on Liberia had recommended the imposition of sanctions against any member of the warring factions that failed to implement the terms of the Agreement and had threatened to recommend to the Security Council the establishment of a war crimes tribunal.
The establishment of war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were significant milestones and reaffirmed the decision of the international community not only to help protect human rights but also to impose sanctions on violators.
The Liberian delegation joined in the appeal made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for assistance to be provided to ECOWAS to enable it to increase to 18,000 the number of its peacekeeping troops.
It had been recognized that the failure to provide the necessary logistical and financial support to ECOWAS following the signing of the first Abuja Agreement had contributed to the breakdown in the peace process.
The deployment of additional troops throughout the country was needed in order to guarantee the disarmament and demobilization of combatants and their reintegration into civil society.
The results of the meeting of the contact group of donors and other interested parties held recently to review the progress made in the Liberian peace process was most encouraging.
The Liberian Government looked forward to working closely with the concerned authorities to address issues relating to the involvement of UNHCR in the provision of assistance to Liberian refugees.
Liberia had every confidence that UNHCR would resume its repatriation programme, which had had to be discontinued following the outbreak of hostilities in April.
Most Liberian refugees residing in neighbouring countries had expressed their desire to return home voluntarily.
While countries of asylum were to be commended for their assistance to refugee women and children, those countries had a moral responsibility and a legal obligation to honour the international conventions to which they were parties.
Had there been a greater commitment to those principles, particularly that of non-refoulement, the tragic consequences of the exodus of Liberian refugees by sea following the April fighting might not have occurred.
The Liberian delegation was encouraged by the spirit of cooperation that existed between the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNHCR and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in addressing issues relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons, as well as humanitarian issues.
It therefore welcomed resolution 1995/56 of the Economic and Social Council on the strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations, and urged its full implementation.
He recognized the importance of programmes of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, rehabilitation and national reconstruction implemented by UNHCR in cooperation with other United Nations bodies in various countries and, in that connection, stressed the importance of establishing an effective coordination mechanism to realize the full potential of such programmes.
In conclusion, he reaffirmed the Liberian Government's appreciation for the assistance which UNHCR continued to provide Liberian refugees and for the plans which were being formulated for their repatriation.
Ms. ARYSTANBEKOVA (Kazakstan) welcomed the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to resolve the problems of population displacement.
In that regard, she stressed the importance of the Regional Conference to Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Relevant Neighbouring States (A/51/341), at which attempts had been made to find joint solutions to those problems.
Involuntary displacements in the region were caused by very complex political as well as historical, social, economic and other factors.
In Kazakstan, for example, emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition, inadequate social reforms, and the decline in the standard of living, as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems.
Furthermore, many persons who had been deported to farm virgin land in Kazakstan and meet industrial objectives, especially during the Second World War, 1941 to 1945, wanted to go back to their areas of origin.
In recent years, while emigration had increased as a result of the lack of employment in Kazakstan, the country's political stability had attracted refugees from other countries.
That was the main reason behind the return of people of Kazak ethnic origin.
The increase in the number of refugees in the country was also attributable to the large number of political asylum-seekers.
In that regard, her Government was grateful to UNHCR and its regional office for their efforts to determine the nationality of the persons returning to Kazakstan.
She pointed out that, in paragraph 174 of its report (A/51/12), UNHCR referred to the resettlement in Kazakstan of "refugees" of Kazak ethnic origin.
The reference should have been to "returnees", because those people had been forced to flee their country.
The Republic of Kazakstan intended to use its migration policy to regulate migration flows and to establish legal, economic and social mechanisms to promote the stability of the process.
To that end, in the framework of the above-mentioned Regional Conference, it had put forward a migration programme. It had enacted the relevant legislation for its implementation.
Mr. REZVANI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that the traditional causes of displacements and refugee movements were political instability, social injustice, human rights violations and intolerance; however, the worsening economic situation in some parts of the world should also be taken into account.
The international community should give priority to the question of development since most of the countries of origin and countries of asylum were developing countries.
Therefore, a comprehensive approach was needed to address the root causes of involuntary population movements.
It was regrettable that, despite the number and magnitude of humanitarian emergencies, UNHCR and other international humanitarian organizations lacked sufficient resources to implement development programmes after providing relief assistance, and that the donor community had lost the incentive to contribute to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development programmes.
In that connection, UNHCR should strengthen its ties with international financial and development institutions.
The Islamic Republic of Iran, a traditional country of asylum, continued to host the largest number of refugees in the world, 1,420,000 Afghans and 585,000 Iraqis (Kurds and Arabs), as noted in the UNHCR report.
The situation had been further complicated by crises in neighbouring countries and illegal immigration.
His Government had been unable to implement the plan it had drawn up to repatriate Afghan refugees to northern Afghanistan, because of recent developments in that country.
For that reason, the Islamic Republic of Iran believed that UNHCR should consider other solutions, in particular the resettlement of those refugees.
Moreover, UNHCR and other international relief organizations should provide more financial assistance in order to alleviate the situation of women, children and vulnerable groups of Afghan refugees.
His Government had also provided emergency relief to newly arrived Iraqi refugees in the country and had accommodated 60,000 people in five camps along its border.
It had spent $10 million to meet the needs of those refugees alone.
Moreover, because of the deterioration of the situation in northern Iraq, the Iranian Red Crescent Society had had to address the needs of 10,000 more Iraqi Kurds who had recently sought asylum in his country.
Since all those refugees would remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran at least through the winter, his Government wished to appeal to the international community to provide adequate assistance to the refugees until such time as they could return to their country.
It welcomed the role of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in providing assistance in emergency situations and wished to reiterate that, with their help, it would continue to provide food, shelter, health services and security to all those people who sought asylum in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Mr. CHAUDHARY (Nepal) said that the flows of refugees and displaced persons caused by political strife, ethnic conflicts and human rights violations in many parts of the world posed a serious challenge to the international community.
According to the UNHCR report, there had been 24 million refugees and displaced persons worldwide at the end of 1995, many of them in the former Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region of Africa, where refugees were still in need of emergency humanitarian assistance.
While his Government welcomed the attention given by UNHCR to the special needs of refugee women and children, and to the environmental issues resulting from the presence of a large number of refugees in the countries of asylum, it felt that UNHCR needed to strengthen its strategy of preparedness, prevention and solutions.
In that regard, Nepal hoped that UNHCR would make further efforts to improve coordination with other United Nations agencies.
His Government was grateful to UNHCR for its continued assistance to 100,000 refugees living in camps in eastern Nepal, and upheld the right of every refugee to return to his or her homeland safely and with dignity.
It would make every effort to solve the problem of refugees from Bhutan through talks with that country's authorities.
Finally, he urged States to strive to solve the problem of refugees, since their large-scale presence in many countries of asylum, particularly in least developed countries like Nepal, aggravated economic problems, caused environmental degradation and worsened social conditions.
Ms. SETYAWATI (Indonesia) said that, while UNHCR was strengthening its capacity to undertake emergency responses to future crises in cooperation with other United Nations bodies, the situation in central Africa continued to be alarming.
She called on all the parties concerned in that area of conflict to respect the rights of refugees and displaced persons.
The real and potential burden of protecting refugees had at times resulted in the denial of entry to asylum-seekers or the forcible return of refugees to their countries of origin.
That situation underscored the need to seek lasting solutions to the problem.
Indonesia welcomed the recognition of the need for international solidarity and burden-sharing with countries of asylum, which, more often than not, were developing countries with limited resources.
International solidarity for development was also required in order to promote conditions that would make voluntary repatriation possible.
Her delegation welcomed the reinforcement of the Office's operational linkages with agencies and partners that had the capacity to address the impact of refugee influxes on the development resources of asylum countries.
The agreement with the United Nations Development Programme on a framework for inter-agency initiatives to promote a smooth transition from humanitarian assistance to sustainable human development was one such example.
Her delegation also welcomed the participation of UNHCR in the work of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee established by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, which would further facilitate implementation of Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/56.
The signing earlier that year of the Memorandum of Understanding between UNHCR and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as the signing of one with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) should strengthen the operational capacities of those organizations, ensuring greater predictability and a more timely, coherent and coordinated response by the international community.
Indonesia was encouraged that UNHCR was taking the initiative to bridge the gap between the inter-agency and the intergovernmental processes, as described in paragraph 206 of the High Commissioner's report.
Only through a genuine partnership with the intergovernmental process would it be possible to begin to mitigate the consequences of refugee situations while also moving toward lasting solutions and the prevention of future crises.
That procedure should be followed in all activities undertaken by the United Nations system, in keeping with the commitment to international cooperation set out in the Charter of the United Nations.
UNHCR was taking measures to strengthen its activities in support of national legal and judicial capacity-building, which must be carried out in consultation and cooperation with Governments.
Moreover, UNHCR was paying increased attention to the promotion of human rights standards in refugee and returnee contexts.
In that regard, her delegation would appreciate receiving clarification from the High Commissioner as to how the promotion of human rights standards was being undertaken by her Office, and what role the intergovernmental process was playing.
Her delegation welcomed the activities of UNHCR in support of refugee women and children.
The staffing of regional refugee women coordinator posts should strengthen the field implementation of existing policies and guidelines on refugee women.
Likewise, it was beneficial that UNHCR was participating in the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
The Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees had come to a successful conclusion, and Indonesia wished to express its appreciation to UNHCR and all countries which had helped to bring about that positive conclusion.
Those events also had purely economic and social causes, and were the direct result of underdevelopment, poverty, structural adjustment programmes, natural disasters and other evils that afflicted the countries of the South. They could also be explained by the serious lack of communication among different societies.
In view of the large exoduses of people and the tragedies they entailed, there was a need to work together to find appropriate solutions not only to the phenomenon itself, but also to its root causes.
Despite its broad and comprehensive mandate, UNHCR could not solve the problem on its own.
Of the population served by UNHCR, basically concentrated in the southern hemisphere, 80 per cent were women and children, more than a third of whom were to be found in Africa.
The States of the South were providing assistance to the extent permitted by their scarce resources, and the disparity between the need for assistance and the resources available to States and international organizations could only exacerbate the needs of which the South's refugees were victims.
Moreover, humanitarian assistance was generally intended only to ensure the survival of those victims.
Algeria had provided humanitarian assistance to Saharan refugees and to displaced persons from Mali and the Niger.
Determined to continue assisting Saharan refugees, Algeria called upon UNHCR to increase its levels of assistance in order to respond more effectively to the needs of that population.
Economic problems and conflicts in the northern regions of Mali and the Niger had led to the displacement of many people into southern Algeria.
Algeria had made great efforts, in conjunction with international organizations and the countries concerned, to accelerate the return of displaced persons to their countries of origin and their socio-economic reintegration there.
Algeria had concluded agreements with Mali and the Niger, as well as with UNHCR and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
In 1996 peace began to be restored and conditions for reintegration improved in the two countries.
The gradual repatriation of displaced persons was made possible with assistance from UNHCR and through collaboration with the States concerned.
Algeria would continue to give its full support to the efforts being undertaken to eliminate the sufferings of the masses of displaced persons throughout the world and would help to eliminate the causes of that problem.
Mr. JAYANAMA (Thailand) said that the world had witnessed a dramatic increase in internal ethnic conflicts and violence which had created a massive wave of forced population movements.
As a consequence, UNHCR was facing greater demand for humanitarian assistance. Recent events in Africa, particularly in the Great Lakes region, and Bosnia had been of concern to the international community.
To find lasting solutions and sustainable political settlements that would prevent such humanitarian catastrophes required the political will of all parties to the conflicts.
UNHCR must not be left to shoulder its burden alone, as the refugee problem was indeed the responsibility of the entire international community.
Since 1975, Thailand had been discharging its humanitarian responsibility by hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees from Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet-Nam.
Despite its limited financial resources, Thailand had cooperated closely with UNHCR, donor countries and related United Nations agencies to find peaceful and durable solutions to the Indo-Chinese refugee problem.
In 1989, a Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees had been adopted in Geneva to address the humanitarian crisis in South-East Asia, in particular, the problem of Vietnamese and Laotian refugees.
The Plan was based on the principles of international burden-sharing and took into account the interests of all parties concerned, including the asylum-seekers themselves.
He was pleased to report that most of the Vietnamese and Laotian refugees in camps in Thailand had returned to their homelands safely and with dignity.
The Government of Thailand wished to express its gratitude to all the parties concerned, particularly UNHCR, donor countries and the Governments of Viet-Nam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic for their great cooperation and understanding.
The implementation of the Comprehensive Plan of Action had been successful because of its balanced design and comprehensiveness.
It addressed the refugee issue in all its dimensions, from the root cause of the outflow in the countries of origin to the return of refugees to the countries of origin, without creating an indefinite burden for the international community or residual problems for countries of first asylum.
In the case of South-East Asia, the Comprehensive Plan of Action had offered the international community valuable lessons in further developing its strategy of prevention, preparedness and solutions in dealing with future crises.
Since many facets of the refugee problem had been linked to the issues of the maintenance of international peace, economic development and humanitarian assistance, it was important for the United Nations to take those issues into consideration in coordinating its activities.
It was extremely important that all parties concerned, including non-governmental organizations, the United Nations system and the entire international community, should work in tandem and continue to provide UNHCR with the necessary resources to overcome the problem of refugees and displaced persons worldwide.
As for the follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and the full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Thailand welcomed the actions taken by UNHCR relating to refugee women, including the strengthening of field implementation of existing guidelines on refugee women, the continuation of UNHCR training programmes for gender issues and the development of the Office's human rights training module targeted at refugee women.
However, his delegation wished to propose that greater efforts should be made to establish appropriate arrangements, especially in conflict situations, to prevent human rights abuses and violence and protect refugee women and girls from them.
His delegation reiterated its intention to continue working in close cooperation with UNHCR and other international organizations to ensure a peaceful and durable solution to the refugee problem.
Ms. ESHMAMBETOVA (Kyrgyzstan) commended the work of UNHCR in providing assistance and protection to refugees, returnees and displaced persons, as well as its prevention strategy to avert new refugee flows.
Although it was gratifying that the repatriation of refugees from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Mozambique and Guatemala had been completed, the worsening of the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa was a matter of concern.
She hoped that the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General would be able to help bring about a solution to the conflict and create conditions enabling UNHCR to fulfil its mandate.
The UNHCR repatriation programme in Bosnia and Herzegovina had proved to be more complex than expected and, with the approach of winter, thousands of persons were currently unable to return to their homes and continued to be literally homeless.
In the case of Afghanistan, the success of the Office's work had been tarnished by the events which had taken place in that country since the end of September.
Nevertheless, she commended the staff of UNHCR and other international institutions and non-governmental organizations, who had, despite the complex military situation, remained in Afghanistan and provided valuable humanitarian assistance.
The Conference held in Geneva in May 1996, sponsored jointly by UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in order to analyze the problems of refugees, displaced persons, other involuntary migrants and returnees in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), had not only achieved the goals that had been set out, but had also created a Steering Group to supervise the follow-up process for the decisions adopted.
That Conference had been preceded by preparatory work of almost two years in which Kyrgyzstan had collaborated with UNHCR, international organizations and other countries.
On the eve of the Conference, Kyrgystan had acceded to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.
That accession had later been ratified by Parliament.
UNHCR had opened two new offices in Kyrgystan, in addition to the existing ones, to provide assistance in various areas.
Kyrgystan highly valued the work of UNHCR in providing assistance to the 15,000 refugees present in the country, who had basically come from Tajikistan, and to monitor the situation in order to prevent the outbreak of hostilities among the different ethnic groups.
The high population density in the country, where 83 ethnic groups coexisted, high levels of unemployment, social problems, the shortage of food and water, as well as the proximity of Tajikistan, trafficking in drugs and weapons, and other problems were factors which threatened peace and stability in the region and required the attention of the Governments and international organizations concerned.
The level of financing for the UNHCR programme in Kyrgystan, which had amounted to $500,000 in 1996, should be increased.
Within the framework of assistance to refugees, Kyrgystan would also welcome the implementation of small-scale income-generating projects.
In order to reduce and prevent migrations, joint projects were being carried out in the country with UNHCR and other organizations, and migration centres were being created with cooperation from the Office, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other organizations to train staff, provide advisory services, set up migration programmes, plan and distribute humanitarian assistance, and to carry out tasks of supervision and early warning.
Since it was basically the responsibility of the Government of each country to implement the Geneva Programme of Action which had been adopted at the Conference referred to, Kyrgystan had set up its own national action programme, which was the basic instrument for implementing Government policy in respect of the various categories of immigrants.
The success of the work of UNHCR was due to a great extent to its collaboration with other international organizations and with the Governments of countries, which showed what could be achieved by working in tandem.
Mr. TSHERING (Bhutan) said that his delegation commended the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees towards finding a durable solution to the plight of refugees and persons displaced by conflicts and civil strife, whose numbers had reached 24 million.
The reduction of that number by 3.5 million in the course of the past year could be attributed to the effective manner with which the High Commissioner had fulfilled his mandate.
At that precise moment, the High Commissioner was facing the major challenge of providing for the well-being of several hundred thousand refugees because of the conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa.
His delegation welcomed the efforts of UNHCR to enhance, through organizational reform, its capacity to respond to emergency situations.
The initiative to conduct extensive reviews of country operations was also a step in the right direction.
He welcomed the Office's efforts to strengthen its operations through collaboration with other United Nations agencies such UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA to address the specific problems of women and children in conflict situations, in accordance with the recommendations of the Beijing Platform for Action.
In many parts of the world, the refugee problem was worsened not only by the increase in conflicts and civil strife, but also more and more by high population growth and pressure on resources and the environment, poverty and illegal immigration, which were issues that must be addressed if future refugee situations were to be avoided.
As for the reference that had been made to people in camps in Nepal who claimed to be refugees from Bhutan, the situation was quite different from other refugee problems, since all the persons in those camps were ethnic Nepalese whose origin and status were a matter of ongoing dialogue between Bhutan and Nepal.
The situation of Bhutan, a small country with a comparatively good ratio of land to its population of 600,000 and relatively better economic opportunities compared to neighbouring regions, had prompted waves of illegal immigration.
Bhutan was already host to a large community of people of Nepalese origin, who enjoyed all the privileges of citizenship in its territory, but the country could not continue to absorb an unending tide of illegal immigration.
The Bhutanese Government fully appreciated the humanitarian dimension of the problem of the people in the camps, and it therefore welcomed the statement of Nepal, a country with which it shared a long history of friendship, to continue bilateral dialogue in the traditional spirit of goodwill and friendship which existed between the two countries in order to find a speedy, just and durable solution to the problem.
Mr. SNOUSSI (Morocco) said that his delegation shared the growing international concern regarding tensions, civil wars and the re-emergence of certain conflicts in various parts of the world which had caused large flows of refugees and displaced persons, and believed that the international community should continue to strive to meet their pressing needs and remedy the situations of extreme emergency in which they found themselves.
The tragic situation in Africa, where one third of the refugees on the planet could be found, was of particular concern and necessitated wide-ranging and sustained action by the international community in view of the grave threats to the economy and stability of the host countries.
The best way to address the problem was to adopt preventive measures, since the causes of the problem went beyond political tensions to embrace all factors of instability, in particular natural disasters and chronic economic difficulties, which occasioned continuous and increasing population movements.
His Government reiterated its ongoing support for the coordinated and integrated approach of voluntary repatriation and hoped that the solutions which had been achieved through the Office's praiseworthy efforts in certain regions of Africa, Asia, Central America and Eastern Europe would be brought about in other areas of the world, thereby enabling refugees to return freely to their countries in conditions of safety and dignity.
Having carefully considered the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (A/51/12) and the report of the Secretary-General on assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa (A/51/367), his delegation wished to express its disagreement with the paragraphs in both documents, which put at 165,000 the number of Saharans in the camps at Tinduf.
Despite having raised that objection on an ongoing basis, his Government had not yet received a satisfactory response from UNHCR, since the written reply sent to the Permanent Representative of Morocco in Geneva dated 22 August 1996 had not been encouraging.
In that letter, UNHCR had indicated that the figure of 165,000 persons had been provided to it by the Algerian authorities in 1982, without mentioning that Morocco had always disputed the figure.
The reasons which UNHCR claimed had prevented it from carrying out a census of the Saharans at Tinduf, and the reasons which supposedly prevented their voluntary repatriation, were unjustified.
With regard to the first point, the Office had stated that it did not wish to obstruct the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
However, that Mission had been established in April 1991, and it was therefore incomprehensible why a census could not have been carried out prior to that date.
Such a course of action would not have violated any provision of the settlement plan, which did not bar UNHCR from applying universally recognized principles of humanitarian law, such as repatriation with the free consent of those involved.
In its repatriation programme, UNHCR estimated at 105,000 the number of persons to be repatriated, basing its calculation on the hypothetical figure of 30,000 identification applications, which had been multiplied by the average number of family members (3.5 individuals).
Regarding free access by UNHCR to Saharans at Tinduf, the Office had indicated in its reply that its officials enjoyed such access and that from mid-1995 to date, representatives of UNHCR and other related bodies had organized some 15 missions. A total of 4,000 Saharans had crossed the border to return to Morocco, despite the threat posed by mines.
His delegation welcomed those efforts and hoped that they would continue and that Member States would be kept abreast of developments.
In that regard, by proclaiming in his appeal on that subject that "the motherland is merciful and compassionate", King Hassan II had given a solemn guarantee to the refugees that they could return home in conditions of safety and dignity.
Mr. KRA (Côte d'Ivoire) said that, in his statement of 31 October 1996 on issues relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons, the High Commissioner had stated that his Office was responsible for a total of 26 million people, over half of whom were refugees.
The report of the Secretary-General on assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa (A/51/367) stated that 9,145,400 of that total were Africans.
The entire African continent faced a refugee problem.
The situation in West Africa was especially worrying to his country.
In Côte d'Ivoire, refugees had integrated into the local population rather than remaining in camps; they freely engaged in agricultural work and other income-generating activities.
That situation enabled UNHCR and the World Food Programme to foresee the gradual suspension of food distribution to those refugees.
However, the presence of Liberian refugees in Côte d'Ivoire had created a problematic situation in which the number of Liberians in many villages was higher than the number of indigenous inhabitants.
That situation was even more worrying owing to the repeated incursions of warring Liberian factions into the territory of Côte d'Ivoire, which had resulted in material losses and casualties and made it difficult for the local population and the refugees to coexist.
His Government was worried by the cost, especially in financial terms, of protecting and assisting refugees on an indefinite basis, which was why his delegation welcomed the fact that various other delegations had laid emphasis on that issue.
He noted with satisfaction the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a special envoy for the Great Lakes region, since the confrontations which had flared up some weeks previously in eastern Zaire, where refugee camps were located, gave rise to fear that a humanitarian disaster might occur.
His delegation urged the international community to adopt urgent and specific measures to ensure that the situation which had come about in other regions of Africa would not be repeated in Zaire.
Mr. AMIR (Yemen) commended the report of UNHCR for the clear explanation of policies and description of work carried out.
However, his delegation was surprised at the figure given in the report for the number of refugees in Yemen, and insisted that it should be rectified, since it constituted unfair treatment of Yemen.
In 1994, despite its limited resources, economic exhaustion caused by the separatist war and the burden represented by the return of thousands of Yemenis as a result of the Gulf War, Yemen had received more than 60,000 Somali refugees and hundreds of refugees of other nationalities.
In cooperation with the UNHCR office in Sana'a, camps had been established in many Yemeni towns, the last of which, Shrukrah, would receive 9,000 Somali refugees and would replace the Al Koud camp, which had been destroyed by arbitrary separatist bombings in mid-1994.
The continuation of assistance would depend on the solidarity of the international community, international and regional organizations, and the donor community, however, since the number of refugees was much greater than indicated in the UNHCR report.
His delegation therefore called on governmental and non-governmental organizations and all those associated with Yemen to increase their assistance to UNHCR and fulfil their humanitarian responsibility, since the refugee burden particularly affected the poorest and least developed countries.
He was concerned about the constant flow of fugitives and infiltrators who arrived illegally in Yemen across the Red Sea.
Yemen reserved the right to adopt measures in relation to that problem and urged the international community to provide assistance in containing that infiltration into Yemeni territory.
The lasting solution to the refugee problem was repatriation, resettlement and reintegration of refugees into their countries of origin, and that could be achieved only through an effort by all the parties and the search for politically satisfactory solutions.
His delegation endorsed the call to convene a regional conference on the situation of refugees in the Horn of Africa. It also supported the High Commissioner's proposal to convene a regional conference for the countries of Central and South—West Asia.
Lastly, he expressed appreciation for the High Commissioner's efforts in the implementation of the Delphi project, with a view to eliminating bureaucracy and allowing more direct involvement of UNHCR personnel in assistance activities.
Yemen was prepared to offer all possible assistance to the High Commissioner.
Mr. KHAN (Pakistan) said that his delegation agreed with the High Commissioner's assessment that the international environment remained volatile.
It expressed satisfaction with the role of UNHCR in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the signing of the Dayton Accord in November 1995.
With regard to the problem of Afghan refugees, which was of great concern to Pakistan, his delegation endorsed the view of UNHCR that, despite the situation in Afghanistan, voluntary return remained the preferred durable solution for the 2.1 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and Iran.
His Government believed that the number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 million, and not 864,000 as indicated in the UNHCR report.
Although the international community was no longer providing financial resources to Pakistan to alleviate that burden, Pakistan had continued to provide humanitarian assistance to those refugees at levels which exceeded its capacity as a developing country.
That generosity had deeply affected Pakistani society at all levels.
Large-scale movements of refugees from rural to urban areas and their participation in economic activities had created massive administrative, economic and social problems.
When a new influx of refugees had occurred in 1994, Pakistan, because of its financial difficulties, had been forced to close its borders to refugees from Afghanistan, after having received a further 200,000 refugees.
Pakistan felt that UNHCR and other United Nations bodies should give priority to the return of internally displaced persons to their areas of origin and their reintegration and resettlement.
However, the will to commit resources and personnel to bring about the repatriation of Afghan refugees appeared to be missing.
Pakistan had been pressed to accept local integration, which could not be regarded as a solution to the problem of those refugees.
If assistance for reconstruction, rehabilitation and the repatriation of Afghan refugees was withheld, millions of innocent Afghanis, especially women and children, would be condemned to displacement and destruction.
The prospects for peace should be accompanied by an acceleration and expansion of international assistance and cooperation as the best option for Afghanistan in humanitarian and political terms.
The successive waves of refugees from Indian-held Kashmir since 1947 had been assimilated in Azad Kashmir and Pakistan.
Thousands of Kashmiris had fled from massive repression and grave violations of human rights by the Indian troops.
That situation was becoming a serious humanitarian crisis.
Successive Governments of Pakistan had provided assistance to those displaced persons and had provided each family with tents, a monthly subsistence allowance, educational allowances for children, free books, funeral expenses and medical care.
Pakistan had been persistently calling for an end to Indian atrocities in Kashmir and for a solution based on the wishes of the Kashmiri people in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council so that the displaced people could go back to their homes in safety and honour.
Refugee crises transcended national boundaries; the United Nations should therefore play a more assertive role in preventing and resolving conflicts that caused refugee movements and use its existing mechanisms of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building, to avert humanitarian disasters.
His delegation hoped that UNHCR would be able to increase its capacity so as to play its role.
Mr. PASHAYEV (Azerbaijan) voiced concern at the continuation of internal conflicts, conflicts between States, acts of aggression, terrorism and environmental disasters which caused new flows of refugees, displaced persons and other forms of involuntary displacement of people and were the source of great suffering.
Considerable material resources must be allocated for the elimination of the impact of such phenomena.
The aggression had caused huge material and human losses, a drop in production, inflation, unemployment and the destruction of infrastructure, which, coupled with the difficulties of an economy in transition, had virtually negated the country's ability to provide assistance to the persons affected.
His delegation wished to express its gratitude for the assistance provided by various United Nations organizations and bodies participating in the programme of emergency humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan, elaborated following the joint needs assessment mission organized by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and UNHCR in February 1996.
It also requested donor countries not to reduce their financial assistance to Azerbaijan and to make every effort to ensure that scheduled projects and programmes were implemented.
In May 1996, the Regional Conference to Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Relevant Neighbouring States had been held under the auspices of UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
During the Conference, consideration had been given to questions relating to the displacement of people following the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the elaboration of a comprehensive strategy for resolving the problems of refugees and displaced persons and preventing possible refugee flows in the future.
The Conference had culminated with the adoption of a Programme of Action.
As a country with 1 million refugees and displaced persons, Azerbaijan welcomed the consideration of the problem in all its aspects, including the convening of conferences and the adoption of bilateral or multilateral measures or initiatives designed to resolve the problem and to establish economic, political and social conditions for the repatriation and return of refugees and displaced persons to their places of origin.
The UNHCR report (A/51/12) indicated that, in the absence of massive new refugee influxes, unlike previous years, the work of UNHCR in the first quarter of 1996 had been characterized by the consolidation of programmes and mechanisms launched in response to previous emergencies and the elaboration of preventive strategies.
His delegation welcomed that positive trend, and the activities of UNHCR to coordinate with other agencies of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), with which it had recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding, the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and others.
Moreover, the consultations held with other institutions, through the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, would make it possible for UNHCR to enhance the effectiveness of its work.
In view of the great number of refugees and displaced persons, more vigorous action, including specific political, economic and other measures, should be taken against States which occupied foreign territory.
That would help to eliminate the causes of many flows of refugees and displaced persons.
Otherwise, the process of resolving the problem and post-conflict voluntary repatriation might be prolonged for years and might eventually deplete the resources which donors allocated for emergency situations.
Azerbaijan attached great importance to improving the work of UNHCR and enhancing its effectiveness in implementing projects and programmes.
It supported the work of reform and restructuring, known as Project Delphi, being carried out in order to reduce losses to a minimum, in particular, the elaboration of the "change management" mechanism, and believed that the work of the High Commissioner in that regard deserved attention and support.
Prince ZEID RA'AD ZEID AL-HUSSEIN (Jordan) said it was ironic that, at a time when enormous technological and social progress was being made, the international community could not resolve the situation of millions of human beings.
It was regrettable that the promises made at the end of the cold war concerning a new world order remained unfulfilled.
His delegation therefore hoped that greater importance would be attached to the item relating to a new international humanitarian order and that the number of Member States sponsoring resolutions on it would increase.
Jordan appreciated the assistance and support it had received from the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and welcomed the work carried out by the Independent Bureau for Humanitarian Issues, particularly the activities it would implement on the basis of existing mechanisms, norms and principles in order to respond more effectively to new challenges.
Without downgrading the existing conventions and humanitarian infrastructure, the new international humanitarian order would make it possible to address new dimensions of old problems and to consider the grey areas of humanitarian issues that threatened human life and dignity.
His delegation was sponsoring a draft resolution on the new international humanitarian order which had no programme budget implications.
It was a recapitulation of the provisions of previous resolutions and highlighted the tremendous responsibility of the international community to provide emergency assistance during prolonged periods where lasting solutions could not be found, and the need to build upon principles and norms relating to emergencies and to ensure respect for them.
In that context, his delegation noted the importance of taking preventative action in addition to remedial action during humanitarian emergencies and of taking action at the national and regional levels before humanitarian problems became international in scale.
He also pointed to the need to strengthen local and regional capacity to develop mechanisms of self-reliance when emergency situations arose and to develop more effective measures to increase international cooperation on the basis of the principle of burden-sharing.
In June 1995, the Lithuanian Parliament had adopted a law on the status of refugees in the Republic of Lithuania.
In accordance with the provisions of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, that law established a procedure for ensuring refugee status for asylum-seekers, provided legal and social guarantees for the protection of refugees and assigned relevant jurisdiction to institutions responsible for refugee matters.
In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the law, the Government had adopted regulations that complemented the laws on emigration and immigration in force since 1992.
At the same time, the Government had taken measures to ensure the appropriate accommodation of refugees.
A unified system of information on migratory processes was nearly completed.
In addition, training programmes had been carried out for the staff of migration authorities and there had been campaigns to promote public awareness of refugee issues.
That progress had been achieved thanks to the logistical and financial assistance amounting to more than US$1.5 million provided by the Nordic countries.
The UNDP office in Vilnius and the UNHCR Regional Bureau had also contributed to those activities and had helped to coordinate them.
By the end of the current year, Lithuania, which was already a party to numerous international legal instruments, would ratify the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.
In the meantime, Lithuania was complying with the principle of not returning persons to territories where they might be persecuted.
Because of the illegal trafficking in migrants through Lithuania to Western European and Nordic countries, the Lithuanian Government had taken measures to protect its borders.
Nevertheless, Lithuania supported readmission as an instrument for preventing illegal migration.
It had therefore concluded readmission agreements and was holding negotiations with a number of countries on the subject.
Lithuania invited its neighbours, the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, to begin negotiations to conclude readmission agreements with Lithuania.
Those agreements represented a step forward in the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by consensus by the States that had participated in the Regional Conference to Address the Problems of Refugees, Displaced Persons, Other Forms of Involuntary Displacement and Returnees in the Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Relevant Neighbouring States.
Lithuania supported the provisions of the Programme of Action concerning the strengthening of bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the exchange of information on migratory processes and the return of deported persons, and efforts to prevent illegal migration and trafficking in migrants.
UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) could contribute to those activities.
Ms. CHOWDHURY (India) said that the problem of refugees and displaced persons was a humanitarian phenomenon of global proportions and seriousness, and its causes were complex and varied.
Conflict situations accounted for the worst refugee problems and usually accentuated the economic deprivations and poverty afflicting the regions in which they took place.
The slight reduction in the number of refugees and the existence of encouraging signs in certain cases was very positive.
However, although the Dayton Accords had raised prospects for large-scale repatriation, the situation in the former Yugoslavia was still plagued with difficulties.
Voluntary repatriations had taken place in Mozambique, South-East Asia, Myanmar, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Other causes for satisfaction were the success of UNHCR with the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees, the comprehensive approach to the problems of returnees, displaced persons and migrants in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the hopes of a solution to the problem of Guatemalan refugees in Mexico, and other triangular arrangements involving countries of origin and of asylum.
However, large numbers of people had recently been uprooted in the Great Lakes region, the Caucasus, West Africa, Iraq and other parts of Asia and Africa.
Concerns about the burden of protecting refugees had caused some Governments to deny entry to asylum-seekers or forcibly return thousands of refugees to their countries of origin.
Those and other violations of the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers had strained the international protection regime for refugees.
The world refugee situation revealed other disturbing trends.
Most of the refugee burden was being borne by developing countries, and the costs were not only economic but also included environmental degradation, social tensions and threats to law and order.
Consequently, the most urgent task facing the international community was to reaffirm, strengthen and extend the international protection regime.
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems, including their security and protection, international solidarity and burden-sharing, supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees, seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses, developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration.
While voluntary repatriation was sometimes the most durable option, local integration and resettlement must not be excluded.
Although ethnic and cultural ties might facilitate local integration and regional resettlement, the economic capacity of receiving countries and the necessary international support must be taken into account.
In that context, she noted that only about 30,000 refugees had been accepted by developed countries during 1995, as compared with the millions of people who had been offered refuge by developing countries.
Resettlement should not be seen merely as a question of whether norms of international protection were respected by first-asylum countries; it should also be seen from the perspective of international burden-sharing.
If emergency relief was provided at the expense of long-term development assistance, a vicious circle would be perpetuated, creating conditions for possible conflicts over scarce resources.
If durable solutions were found, humanitarian action could become a spur for long-term development.
In that context, it was distressing to note that appeals by UNDP and UNHCR to address the huge environmental and other damage in eastern Zaire and parts of Tanzania had gone largely unheeded.
While it was true that comprehensive solutions required political, security, humanitarian and development efforts, UNHCR should not enter into political discourse, since that could compromise its non-partisan image, which was precisely the source of its credibility.
In the interests of refugees, the credibility of UNHCR should be preserved at all costs.
Mr. KORNELIOU (Cyprus) said that his delegation associated itself with previous speakers who had emphasized that the safety of displaced persons must be guaranteed.
In that connection, he was very concerned about the situation of refugees in the Great Lakes region, which called for urgent action.
Other complex emergency situations included the problems faced by Afghan, Somali and Liberian refugees.
As for Bosnia, it was vitally important to implement the provisions of the Dayton Agreement relating to the return of refugees and displaced persons.
At the same time, his delegation noted with great satisfaction that during the past two years more than 3 million refugees had returned to their countries of origin, most of them to Afghanistan, Mozambique and Myanmar.
His Government strongly supported the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their countries of origin.
Nevertheless, a better understanding of the root causes of such mass exoduses should make it possible to prevent the continuous uprooting of millions of people.
It was an inalienable right of refugees and displaced persons to be able to rebuild their lives elsewhere, as well as to be able to return to their homes and recover their property.
One of the most tragic aspects of the Cyprus problem was that of internally displaced persons.
In 1974, about 200,000 Greek Cypriots and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots had become refugees in their own homeland owing to the Turkish invasion and continued occupation of the northern part of Cyprus.
Since that time, not a single refugee had been allowed by the occupation forces to return to his home.
A number of resolutions adopted by international bodies, such as the Security Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Committee and, most recently, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, had called, inter alia, for the safe return of refugees to their countries.
Ms. MSUYA (United Republic of Tanzania) said that the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa remained a source of concern for the international community, particularly for her Government.
Although at the beginning of 1996 there had been renewed expectations for significant voluntary repatriation, the deterioration of security in Burundi and the recent outbreak of violence in eastern Zaire had not only diminished prospects for voluntary repatriation but had triggered a new wave of asylum-seekers.
That situation had led to further human suffering and destruction.
The Great Lakes region had had a refugee population of 2 million since 1994.
Following the genocide in Rwanda, the refugee population at the border areas of the United Republic of Tanzania had surpassed the local population, making the burden on the local population and the Government unbearable.
The large-scale influx of refugees had had a negative impact on the provision of social services to the local population, had damaged the environment and had overburdened the infrastructure.
In addition, it had bred widespread social tension, which in the long run could undermine the traditional spirit of hospitality to refugees.
Given the disproportionate burden of the refugee problem on certain countries, there was a need for concerted efforts by the international community to address the problem by strengthening international instruments to provide protection for those in need of asylum and by stemming the increasing tendency towards xenophobia, refusal to protect refugees and their forced repatriation.
The good work undertaken by UNHCR and other United Nations agencies deserved constant support.
Following the conference sponsored by the Organization of African Unity and UNHCR in Bujumbura in February 1996, a consensus had been reached that there was a need to accelerate voluntary repatriation, since the delay in repatriation had exacerbated tension in the camps and perpetuated the burden on host countries.
There was therefore a need to reinforce international solidarity and burden-sharing through resettlement in third countries.
Pursuant to the recommendations of the Bujumbura Plan of Action, UNDP and UNHCR had organized a consultative meeting of donor and asylum countries at the beginning of 1996 to discuss the situation regarding assistance to areas adversely affected by large numbers of refugees.
A $70.5 million short-term assistance package had been presented to help repair damage to the environment and infrastructure.
Since a positive response had not yet been forthcoming, her delegation urged the international community to respond generously to that appeal.
In addressing the immediate needs of refugees and asylum countries, it was important to expand efforts to prevent situations that gave rise to refugee flows.
Respect for and promotion of human rights and access to social and economic development were equally important.
International solidarity with refugees should therefore not be limited to emergencies.
In conclusion, her delegation commended UNHCR on its adoption of an integrated approach to the issues of relief, rehabilitation and development on behalf of refugees.
UNHCR had also fostered partnership with other United Nations agencies, notably UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and non-governmental organizations.
Her delegation endorsed the appeal of UNHCR to the international community to redouble its efforts to address the refugee crisis.
In the short term, there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements.
The statements he had heard over the past few days had reflected deep concern at the new calamity unfolding in the Great Lakes region of Africa.
That crisis illustrated the many difficulties that existed in providing humanitarian assistance and seeking solutions in the midst of complex and highly charged political situations, as well as the fundamental need to ensure that humanitarian action was accompanied by the political will to solve the bitter conflicts that were the immediate cause of most refugee problems.
Such crises had to be addressed in a comprehensive and holistic manner without ignoring their causes.
In order to find lasting solutions to crises, UNHCR must continue to build linkages to political and developmental institutions at the international and regional levels while avoiding the politicization of humanitarian action.
In order to speed up progress towards a lasting solution, voluntary repatriation should be combined with local integration and third-country resettlement in host countries.
It was also encouraging to note that many delegations had acknowledged the link between rehabilitation and repatriation, on the one hand, and consolidating peace and resuming development, on the other.
In order to ensure that that link was maintained, the scope and duration of UNHCR rehabilitation and returnee-protection activities must be better delineated by making the best use of the expertise and resources of its partners, as had recently been done in Mozambique.
In addition, international burden-sharing remained essential to help reduce the negative economic and ecological impact of refugee influxes in the developing world and to sustain protection.
Continuous efforts were necessary to develop the legal framework which provided the basis of international protection.
He had been particularly encouraged by the statement of Lithuania, which had highlighted that country's efforts to develop national refugee legislation.
The Office also recognized the important role that women could play in assistance programmes as well as in the search for solutions and initiatives aimed at reconciliation.
Effective coordination with a broad spectrum of actors was essential to efforts to resolve refugee problems.
UNHCR would continue to strengthen its links with UNDP and the World Bank in order to achieve greater predictability in its relationships with its development partners.
The Office was currently revising and enhancing its memorandums of understanding with a number of key intergovernmental partners, including UNDP and WHO.
It was also firmly committed to working with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to improve coordination and achieve effective follow-up to resolution 1995/56 of the Economic and Social Council.
It continued to believe, however, that inter-agency coordination on the ground was the real test and that, in many cases, it could best be achieved through the mechanism of a lead agency.
Finally, he wished to thank the Governments represented in the Third Committee for the strong encouragement which they had given to the work of the Office.
That claim was totally without basis.
The Government of Eritrea had not responded to the repeated appeals of Sudan.
His delegation wished to reiterate its Government's willingness to immediately seek a trilateral agreement for the repatriation of the Eritrean refugees.
That would require, however, a willingness on the part of the regime in Eritrea to do so and a willingness to assume its responsibilities to its citizens without discrimination.
The reckless policies of the Government of Eritrea were eloquently reflected in the fact that it demanded the payment of exorbitant sums to permit the return of many of the refugees currently living abroad, including in Western countries.
In his view, such an attitude could only be described as repugnant "blackmail" and "exploitation of humanitarian problems".
The objective of the representative of Nepal in taking the floor was to comment on the two references contained in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (A/51/12) to the situation of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, specifically in paragraphs 125 and 128 of the report.
Mr. CHAUDHARY (Nepal) thanked the representative of Bhutan for his understanding and restated the views which he had expressed in his earlier statement.
The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 28TH MEETING
Chairman: Mrs. ESPINOSA (Mexico)
CONTENTS
AGENDA ITEM 108: ELIMINATION OF RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION (continued)
AGENDA ITEM 109: RIGHT OF PEOPLES TO SELF-DETERMINATION (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
(A/51/3 (Parts I and II), A/51/18, A/51/90, A/51/301, A/51/427, A/51/430, A/51/435, A/51/541, A/51/462-S/1996/831)
AGENDA ITEM 109: RIGHT OF PEOPLES TO SELF-DETERMINATION (continued) (A/51/392, A/51/414, A/51/532-S/1996/864)
Ms. TOMIĆ (Slovenia) said that racism was a recurrent phenomenon, the most brutal manifestation of which in recent years had been "ethnic cleansing".
The perpetrators of such heinous crimes as genocide should be judged on the basis of their individual responsibility.
Her delegation supported the work of the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the early establishment of the International Criminal Court, which should be a permanent and impartial mechanism.
The demonstrations of intolerance, xenophobia and racially motivated violence which persisted in the everyday life of societies stemmed from ignorance and the fear of diversity.
In order to combat such demonstrations, it was important to enact laws which would prohibit de jure and de facto racial discrimination.
Governments had an obligation to ensure the peaceful coexistence of their citizens on a basis of equality and non-discrimination.
Tolerance and respect for others should be promoted through the dissemination of information, education and the training of civil servants and of military and other personnel.
Her delegation had noted with satisfaction the large number of States that had ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and urged States that had not yet done so to ratify the Convention, to limit the number of reservations they made to it, and to ensure that such reservations were not incompatible with the purposes of the Convention.
It was important that compliance with the obligations arising from international human rights instruments should be monitored by an international body such as the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
The Committee's improved working practices were encouraging, particularly with regard to the combined consideration of overdue reports of States Parties.
Its early warning measures and urgent procedures were also commendable, and constituted an important contribution to the prevention of racial discrimination.
With regard to the serious financial crisis facing the Committee, her delegation supported the decision of the States Parties to amend article 8 of the Convention in order to provide financing for the Committee from the regular budget of the United Nations.
Although it would soon be five years since the decision had been approved by the General Assembly, only 17 States had ratified the amendment. It was therefore to be hoped that the States Parties to the Convention would accelerate their ratification procedures, in order to achieve the two-thirds majority of States Parties required for the amendment to enter into force.
Mrs. CHOWDHURY (India) said that, for much of the post-war period, forms of racism other than apartheid had been virtually ignored by the international community.
With the dismantling of the regime in South Africa which had applied apartheid, racist and xenophobic doctrines and attitudes as global phenomena had assumed greater importance in United Nations efforts to abolish racism.
In a number of countries, notably in the western world, weaknesses in anti-discrimination laws, lax enforcement, and the rise of ultra-conservative political formations with racist platforms reflected a disturbing degree of complicity in and even of acceptance of racial intolerance and discrimination.
Racist propaganda was responsible for such phenomena as the desecration of cemeteries and religious places, the hardening of immigration laws, the rise in numbers of refugees and increased encroachment on the lands of minority or indigenous communities.
The international community must work to counter those tendencies.
Her delegation fully supported the Special Rapporteur's call for a world conference on racism and racial discrimination, including the question of immigration and xenophobia, or for exploration of the possibility of holding another conference on the last theme. Such a conference could also examine whether incitement to racial hatred, particularly through the new information media, was justifiable under the right to freedom of expression.
The expert seminar organized by the Centre for Human Rights on the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination had concluded that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or racial hatred would be a lawful restriction of the right to freedom of opinion, expression and association as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Her delegation was concerned by the lack of resources for the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate, particularly with respect to education promoting tolerance and respect for other cultures and peoples.
The same problem was affecting execution of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.
The Commission on Human Rights should take those issues into account at its next session.
Democratic societies provided adequate scope for the self-determination of peoples.
However, as the Vienna Declaration made clear, self-determination should not be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States.
It was important to emphasize the Secretary-General's observation that if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic well-being for all would become even more difficult to achieve.
The Secretary-General's observation was reinforced by General Recommendation XI (48) adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and contained in its report (A/51/18). In that Recommendation, the Committee emphasized that, in accordance with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 in resolution 2625 (XXV), none of the Committee's actions should be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political integrity of sovereign and independent States conducting themselves in compliance with the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and possessing a Government representing the whole people belonging to the territory.
In the view of the Committee, international law had not recognized the general right of peoples unilaterally to declare secession from a State.
Unfortunately, the report was confined to the consideration of the problem of contracts undertaken by professional mercenaries, and did not dwell sufficiently on the use of mercenaries in terrorist and seditious activities. Such use, of which India had been the victim for more than a decade, constituted a growing threat to democratic and multicultural States.
She hoped that when they next resumed their deliberations, the Commission on Human Rights and its working groups would give serious consideration to the problems of racism, self-determination and mercenary activity.
Ms. SAVCHENKO (Ukraine) said that approaches were needed which would lead to just and flexible solutions to conflicts that might arise from the exercice of the right of self-determination of peoples.
The solution to such problems must be based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and on the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States, on the Helsinki Final Act and on other instruments of international law which protected the sovereignty of States, their territorial integrity and the inviolability of their frontiers.
The right to self-determination could not be equated with separatism.
The aforementioned Declaration of the General Assembly stated that the recognition of self-determination was not to be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity of sovereign and independent States.
Certain States considered that the right to self-determination of peoples was applicable to the claims of national and even regional minorities but in the opinion of her delegation that was unjustified.
Her country had granted broad administrative and territorial autonomy to Crimea, but that had not put an end to the demands of certain groups, in Crimea and outside Ukraine, which invoked the right to independence of a so-called "Crimean people".
Her country had endeavoured to solve the social and economic problems of Crimea, adopting measures which could not be considered discriminatory, since they were compatible with international law and with internationally recognized principles of human rights.
Her delegation considered that the right to self-determination could not entail territorial separation for an ethnic group if that group was not in a majority in the territory concerned and if the other groups living there objected to the separation.
Her delegation believed that, if the legal gaps concerning the means of exercising the right to self-determination could be filled, the justifications on which separatist movements based their legitimacy would disappear.
It was therefore important to create global mechanisms for resolving potential conflict situations regarding the exercise of that right.
Her delegation also believed that the granting of independence was not usually the ideal solution and could not be applied in all cases.
As for the subject of elimination of racism and racial discrimination, her country's legislation prohibited those phenomena, particularly forms of them which were directed against national minorities, which were a very large component of its population.
She emphasized the need for international cooperation to increase the effectiveness of national measures to combat such blemishes on society.
Ms. CORNETTE (Guyana), speaking on behalf of the Member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) which were Member of the United Nations, said that the CARICOM member States, conscious of the fact that discrimination and intolerance had caused most of the world's tragedies and suffering, had always been firmly against all forms of racism and racial discrimination.
That position had been reflected in their denunciation of apartheid, and they considered its demise as one of the greatest accomplishments of the international community, and particularly of the United Nations, in the struggle to eliminate racism and racial discrimination.
However, other forms of racism and racial discrimination, such as xenophobia and persecution of minorities, ethnic groups, migrant workers and refugees and the heinous policy of "ethnic cleansing", continued to be a cause for serious concern.
The eradication of all those contemporary forms of racism should be given the highest priority by the world community and preventive measures should be taken to combat them.
The CARICOM member States called upon the United Nations and the international community to do everything possible to bring under control the currently explosive situation in Rwanda and Zaire.
The work of the international tribunals for the prosecution of persons responsible for war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia should also be given full support.
The CARICOM member States considered that the elimination of discrimination and intolerance could not be achieved without universal adherence to and implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other relevant international human rights instruments.
It was particularly important for Governments to cooperate with established monitoring mechanisms, particularly the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
They also attached great importance to the implementation of the revised programme for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.
The international community must work together to attain the objectives of the programme of activities for the Decade.
The CARICOM member States emphasized the importance of the role played by the Centre for Human Rights in coordinating activities to prevent racial and ethnic conflict.
Consideration should be given to establishing early warning procedures to improve the capacity of the United Nations to prevent such conflicts.
The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and racial intolerance, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights could play a critical role in elaborating the theoretical and conceptual approach to new forms of those phenomena.
Maximum use should also be made of the opportunities offered by the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education.
The CARICOM member States strongly believed that education, information and awareness could play an important role in eliminating racial prejudice and stereotypes, thus fostering mutual understanding and tolerance, and achieving racial harmony.
The CARICOM member States joined the appeal for adequate financial and human resources to support the implementation of the activities for the Third Decade and to enable the Special Rapporteur to carry out his mandate effectively and efficiently.
They also urged all States which had not yet done so to ratify all conventions and legal instruments on racial discrimination.
Despite the many resolutions adopted in support of the universal realization of the right of all peoples to self-determination, people in many parts of the world were still being denied the exercise of that right.
The member States of CARICOM viewed action to promote the right to self-determination through practical and peaceful measures as the only effective means of ensuring that the interests of all States were represented.
CARICOM States wished to reaffirm their commitment to the principles of the right to self-determination as it applied to the Palestinian people. They urged the parties concerned to pursue peace in the region and called for collective efforts to be made towards a peaceful solution.
Recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination would serve the interests of all the parties involved.
The report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance drew attention to the link between mercenary activities and terrorism, an issue that was of serious concern to member States of CARICOM.
Such activities included not only acts of terrorism but also trafficking in drugs and arms. The member States of CARICOM therefore strongly supported the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that all States should incorporate practical measures into their national legislation to prohibit the use of their territory for the recruitment, training, assembly or transit of mercenaries and called upon the General Assembly to reaffirm its condemnation of such activities.
Mr. MEDKAD (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the international community should keep under consideration the question of the self-determination of peoples, since, despite the fact that the related problems had become less serious, it was necessary to find solutions to the threats to international peace and security posed by colonialism, foreign occupation and other forms of domination.
Racism and racial discrimination, particularly discrimination against foreigners in the developed countries, was a matter of deep concern.
The efforts made by the United Nations in recent years in fulfilment of the Charter had permitted many peoples to exercise their right to self-determination.
The Syrian Arab Republic was one of the first countries to achieve independence after the Second World War and had been a firm defender of the rights of peoples to self-determination, particularly those peoples who were under foreign or colonial domination and occupation.
The transformations which had taken place since the 1960s had not succeeded in changing the basic principles for which mankind had always struggled, including the right of peoples to liberate themselves from oppression.
Racism in all its manifestations was another form of denial of rights and must be eradicated as early as possible.
The Constitution and laws of the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirmed the importance of the struggle against racism and racial discrimination in all their forms and manifestations.
Syria was party to all the conventions against racism and racial discrimination.
With regard to the situation of the Palestinian people, the expansionist policy of Israel was a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of human rights and international law.
Over the previous 50 years, Palestinian refugees in different parts of the world had cherished the hope of returning to the homeland from which they had been expelled by force of arms and, unable to do anything, they observed how Israel was inviting Jewish settlers from all countries to occupy their land.
It was difficult to understand the international community's inability to force Israel to respect the principles of international law.
Nevertheless, sooner or later, Israel would have to put an end to its anti-peace policy, withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
Syria had reaffirmed on numerous occasions and wished to do so once again its commitment to securing a just and comprehensive peace in the region based on the principles agreed upon at the Madrid conference, which were embodied in various Security Council resolutions, and of the principle of "land for peace".
Mr. BORDA (Colombia) reiterated the firm and unswerving commitment of Colombia to the elimination of racial discrimination and its readiness to cooperate with the mechanisms of the United Nations.
Colombia was party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and had submitted its periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
The Government of Colombia was reviewing the Committee's recommendations and would take them into account when preparing its next report.
Colombia had also hosted a visit by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
The 1991 Constitution of Colombia enshrined not only respect for and the dignity of ethnic minorities in Colombian society but also the principle of equality without distinction on the grounds of sex, race, national or family origin, language, religion, or political or philosophical opinion.
The Government's firm commitment had been reflected in the 1995-1996 programme of support for and ethnic strengthening of the indigenous peoples of Colombia, whose principal objectives were to support the systems of social, economic and cultural organization that were peculiar to the indigenous peoples, thereby strengthening their ties with the systems of the national society; to propose measures for the protection, promotion, dissemination and defence of the rights of those populations; to support the autonomous and sustainable development of ethnic groups; to promote the participation of indigenous peoples and communities in the decision-making process; and to disseminate and communicate information on the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Colombian nation.
Resources had also been allocated to various investment programmes, especially in the fields of education and health.
The Department of Black Community Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior formulated policy in that area, taking into account the recommendations of a high-level advisory committee.
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities, through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental, regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects, and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations.
The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media. He drew attention to the cooperation which Colombia had given to United Nations mechanisms and his country's participation in the negotiations on the special regime for access to genetic resources, approved by the Andean Pact countries in July 1996, which would directly benefit black, indigenous and local communities.
The Colombian Government was also convinced that economic development and the improvement of the social situation would mark a major step forward for the indigenous and black communities of Colombia.
In a brief reference to the right of peoples to self-determination, he reiterated Colombia's support for the right of Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State in their homeland and expressed his concern over the difficulties which the peace process in the Middle East was encountering and his confidence that the parties would fully honour their agreement.
He also urged them to settle their differences through dialogue and a peaceful solution to their disputes.
Mr. KAMAL (Pakistan) said that self-determination was the central organizing principle for international relations among sovereign States, and the right of peoples to self-determination was the foundation of the international order.
The essential postulate for the exercise of that right was that it should be a free and genuine expression of the will of the people without any type of external coercion.
No election, referendum or plebiscite held unilaterally by the colonial or occupying authorities constituted a free expression of the will of the people.
No amount of autonomy granted by an occupying Power could replace the legitimate right of peoples under colonial or foreign domination to seek freedom.
He hoped that the situation in the Middle East would culminate in a lasting peace, and that peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina would be consolidated, that the country's territorial integrity would be preserved and that the aggressors would be punished in accordance with international law.
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, he said that India, despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region, had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties: India, Pakistan and the United Nations.
The right to self-determination was not subject to prescription and remained valid until it was freely exercised.
India had brutally crushed the peaceful movement which the Kashmiri people had launched in 1989 to secure their freedom, and the 700,000 troops deployed there by India had been responsible for massacres, torture and disappearances, arson, and collective reprisals.
India had also held sham elections in May and September 1996, organized in phases so as to ensure greater concentration of troops in the areas where they were being held.
India's depiction of the Kashmiri freedom struggle as a secessionist movement was a classic colonial ploy.
Kashmir was the core of the differences between India and Pakistan and the principal cause of tension in the region.
In seeking a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir question, three aspects must be addressed.
Firstly, action must be taken to reduce tensions and to avert a possible threat to peace.
India should accept the offer of good offices made by the Secretary-General over the past three years, and Pakistan's proposals on the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General, expansion of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to monitor the "line of control", and the sending of a fact-finding mission to Jammu and Kashmir.
Secondly, and most importantly, India must renounce the use of force as a means of resolving the crisis in Kashmir.
Thirdly, sincere and meaningful negotiations to seek a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute should be held, and India should display flexibility and imagination in those talks. It must be understood that no settlement could be durable if it was unacceptable to the people of Kashmir.
The Jammu and Kashmir dispute defined the very character of the United Nations.
The Security Council, employing mediation, arbitration and preventive diplomacy, had reached conclusions which had been the basis for various resolutions which defined the modus operandi for the resolution of the dispute.
To deny their implementation would be tantamount to challenging the raison d'être of the United Nations and flouting the established norms of international law.
India was accountable to the comity of nations for its brutal repression in Kashmir.
Mr. SERGIWA (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that racism was an affront to human dignity and to the principle of equality among peoples.
Despite the efforts of the international community to eradicate that scourge and the numerous international human rights instruments in force, its manifestations continued to affect millions of people.
His Government was alarmed at the propagation of contemporary forms of racism, such as the campaign of xenophobia against migrant workers, especially the campaign against the Muslim-Arab minority in many countries.
As to the report on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/51/301), prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, he regretted that it did not refer to racial practices in the occupied territories and requested that in future issues of racism and racial discrimination should be considered in a broader sense.
He also regretted that the Centre for Human Rights had not been able to carry out more activities for lack of resources.
Therefore, he emphasized the need for the Centre to be provided with the necessary resources to carry out the activities organized for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination.
Within the framework of the Decade, the international community should do all it could to combat all forms of racism, to promote tolerance and understanding among all races and to fight against doctrines which affirmed the supremacy of one race over another.
Although the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration and the relevant General Assembly resolutions proclaimed the right to self-determination of peoples suffering under the yoke of colonialism, there were still peoples such as the Palestinians who were denied that right.
Consequently, Israel must withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, so that the Palestinian people could return to the land from which it had been expelled and so that a State could be established in which Jews and Arabs could live together in peace.
Lastly, he pointed out that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in accordance with the principles of Islam, ensured respect for the rights of all its inhabitants without discrimination on grounds of race, sex, colour or language.
The Libyan Government had always condemned racial discrimination and had supported the right to self-determination for all peoples in various international forums.
Me. AL-HITTI (Iraq) said that the ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq had coexisted fraternally for centuries.
The Iraqi Constitution protected the rights of the Kurdish people and the other two minorities in Iraq, Syrians and Turks.
Those minorities had their own political parties and cultural associations, through which they expressed their aspirations and opinions.
Also, Iraqi legislation protected the rights of minorities and guaranteed equality among all linguistic, religious and national groups, as well as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In that context, he recalled that minorities in Iraq could not be regarded as indigenous populations.
Their situation should therefore be considered in the context of human rights issues.
It was important to avoid confusing the issue of minorities with that of indigenous populations, and careful consideration should be given to the accreditation of organizations which claimed to represent indigenous populations.
Although both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stated that all peoples had the right of self-determination, could freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources and that in no case might a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, some States had flouted that right and had even gone as far as intervening militarily against specific countries such as Iraq.
The Iraqi people's right of self-determination had been violated through: the intervention in the north of the country, which had undermined national unity; the establishment of no-fly zones, which violated Iraq's right to control its airspace; the launching of missiles by the United States, which had resulted in the death of many Iraqis; and the embargo that prohibited the sale of oil, the country's main source of revenue.
Iraq therefore urged the international community to oppose that policy and ensure that the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the International Covenants on Human Rights were respected.
Mr. MINOVES-TRIQUELL (Andorra) said that both the Andorran Constitution and the policy traditionally implemented by Andorra guaranteed equality for all, tolerance and respect for human rights.
Andorra, which had enjoyed peace and freedom since the twelfth century, had taken in many refugees of different races and religions and supported United Nations activities to combat all forms of racial discrimination.
Racism went against the very essence of humankind.
However, many people directed their prejudices, frustrations and malice against people of different ethnic origins.
People who discriminated against others thoughtlessly, out of ignorance, were to be pitied and must be educated, but those who did so wittingly must be condemned by mankind.
Since the United Nations was an essential forum for the struggle against racism, his delegation welcomed the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/51/301).
It also supported all activities to combat those phenomena, in particular activities designed to raise the awareness of civil society and to provide human rights education to young people.
With respect to the self-determination of peoples, that basic right involved many responsibilities but was intimately linked to the principles of democracy and the freedom of individuals and peoples.
Moreover, since it was one of the most difficult rights to implement, it should be studied in depth.
His delegation therefore welcomed the initiatives of Liechtenstein to promote the debate on self-determination, especially the conferences organized on that topic.
Mr. KAUSIKAN (Singapore) said that his delegation wished to make some comments on the report of the Special Rapporteur contained in document A/51/301.
In paragraph 4 of the introduction, the Special Rapporteur indicated that, as the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat was still understaffed, it had not been possible to gather the necessary information from Member States for the preparation of the document. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur had relied on sources from quasi-governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations; he had also consulted reliable articles in the international press.
His delegation could not accept that the lack of manpower had prevented the Special Rapporteur from consulting Member States on matters which concerned them; in failing to consult Member States, the Special Rapporteur had violated an elementary principle of justice.
Consequently, the report contained elementary errors which cast doubts on its credibility.
For example, in paragraph 20 of the report (sect. III), the Special Rapporteur noted that, in Asia, intraregional migration created tension between countries of emigration and host countries, because of the way in which the citizens of the former were treated.
While it was a fact that intraregional migration had from time to time created tensions between some countries, the insinuation that tensions had arisen because of discrimination against immigrants was absurd.
By means of such logic, the Special Rapporteur seemed to suggest that persons with immigrant status should be exempt from the criminal law of the countries in which they resided, which was unacceptable.
Singapore applied its laws - which some might characterize as harsh, but which were necessary - equally to everyone residing in the country, without exception.
Further on in paragraph 21 of the report, the Special Rapporteur used as an example the fact that relations between the Philippines and Singapore had deteriorated in 1995 after the execution of a Philippine domestic worker who had been accused of murdering her employer; he also indicated that the Philippine authorities had cast doubt on the circumstances of the trial.
There was an elementary factual error in that paragraph: the domestic worker in question had never been accused of murdering her employer.
She had been charged, tried and convicted of murdering a fellow Filipina and the child who was her ward.
The elementary error of fact did not reflect well on the Special Rapporteur's standard of research.
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur provided incomplete information: while he had noted that relations between the Philippines and Singapore had deteriorated in 1995, he had failed to indicate that relations between the two countries had been restored in the same year, well before the submission of the Special Rapporteur's report in August 1996.
Moreover, the domestic worker had been given full recourse to due legal process, including a fair and open trial at all stages, as well as the right of appeal and the right to seek pardon in the post-trial phase.
Not only had Singapore guaranteed the accused full recourse to due legal process but it had also taken special pains in her case.
Had the Special Rapporteur bestirred himself to conduct a little elementary research, he would have discovered that an independent third-party panel of United States forensic experts appointed by the Singapore and the Philippine Governments had unanimously upheld the findings of the Singaporean pathologists, and that both Governments had accepted the panel's findings.
The facts omitted were not secrets since they had been widely publicized in the very same international press that, his delegation assumed, the Special Rapporteur had consulted.
The letter which the Centre for Human Rights had sent to Singapore and other Member States in May 1996 had been of a general nature.
Since the Special Rapporteur had intended to refer to specific cases in his report, it was very puzzling that the Centre for Human Rights had not consulted Singapore on that specific case; it was all the more puzzling because the case had been resolved nearly one year before the letter had been sent.
In fact, when the Special Rapporteur was preparing his report, the Centre for Human Rights already had before it the basic facts of the case in question.
It was true that at that time there had been another Special Rapporteur, but the Special Rapporteurs could surely be expected to speak to each other, at the least; had they done so, the elementary factual errors in question would have been avoided.
Such errors could not be attributed to lack of staff or resources; they were the result of a lack of professionalism, if not outright negligence.
His delegation would like to know whether the Special Rapporteur intended to correct those errors and, if so, how he was going to go about it.
Unless minimal professional standards were met and reports were prepared with due regard to the basic requirements of objectivity and factual accuracy, his delegation would have no option but to conclude that the problem was not that resources were inadequate, but that they had been squandered.
Mr. KUNDA (Zambia) said that his delegation subscribed without reservations to the statement made earlier by the delegation of Angola on behalf of the group of States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
In his introductory statement, the Special Rapporteur had referred to the problems of immigration and the resultant tensions, noting that Zambia had chartered flights to repatriate legal and illegal immigrants from West Africa.
The Zambian Government had always welcomed legal immigrants and would always do so, since the Zambian people prided themselves on their hospitality.
However, illegal migration was against the law, which much be enforced.
The smuggling of precious and semi-precious stones from Zambia was common knowledge; his Government had proof of cases of people entering the country illegally for that sole purpose.
That practice deprived the Zambian people of much-needed revenue. As a poor country struggling to develop, Zambia could not allow itself to be robbed of its natural resources.
The people who had been repatriated to their countries of origin were either convicted criminals who had served their sentences or had previously been deported from Zambia for illegal entry into the country. Zambia did not see such action as intolerant or dehumanizing; it was a question of protecting law and order.
There were many people from West Africa who had settled, become integrated and prospered in Zambia.
Lastly, Zambia attached great importance to the work of the Special Rapporteur and wished to assure him of its full support in the discharge of his functions.
Mr. ZELACI (Algeria) said that the foundations of a balanced and just international order would continue to be fragile as long as the threat of instability caused by the many and varied scourges of today persisted.
Racism and racial discrimination continued to be rampant in various regions and, ironically, was more common in those countries in which democratic values and human rights were firmly rooted.
The nationalistic policies, economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties, interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers, refugees, asylum-seekers, minorities and indigenous populations. Very often, the media and new technologies, such as electronic mail and the Internet, facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist, xenophobic and neofascist practices.
In addition, national laws that placed restrictions on resident aliens or tourists reinforced feelings of xenophobia and racism which might have already existed even in the most democratic societies.
The mass expulsion of migrant workers and asylum-seekers in the different continents seemed to have become a formula for the control of migratory movements, in violation of the principle of non-discrimination, which continued to be one of the pillars of human rights.
States must take legislative, administrative and political measures to provide for civil and criminal sanctions against perpetrators of racist acts. They should also undertake national campaigns to promote greater public awareness and to mobilize public opinion, including through education, with a view to eradicating racism and racial discrimination throughout the world.
Algeria was determined to eliminate those phenomena through its national policies.
As part of the measures agreed upon between States and the international organizations, Algeria fully supported proposals for the convening of an international conference on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; the creation of a mechanism to monitor the media as purveyors of hatred, racism and xenophobia; making the administrative regulations for the granting of visas more flexible; promoting exchanges between individuals and cross-cultural communication; and the teaching of human rights at all levels of education.
Despite the fact that the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination was embodied in a series of international instruments, there were still peoples who had not been able to exercise that right.
Until that goal was attained, the work of the United Nations to bring about peace would be incomplete.
The new Israeli Government's intransigent policies and its failure to honour its commitments endangered the Middle East peace process.
While Algeria welcomed the progress made towards the consolidation of the peace process in the region, there was still need for a comprehensive and lasting solution, based on the return of all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.
Algeria would spare no effort to ensure that the settlement plan of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity was implemented and the people of Western Sahara were able to freely exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, which would no doubt contribute to stability and peaceful coexistence in the region.
Mr. MATEŠIĆ (Croatia) said that paragraph 14 of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of the use of mercenaries contained a note verbale from the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations Office at Geneva in response to a letter from the Special Rapporteur inquiring about two individuals who were suspected of being mercenaries.
Neither the report nor the note verbale made it clear in which country the suspected mercenaries operated or under whose command.
The activities mentioned in the note had not taken place in the territory of the Republic of Croatia and neither the military units nor the commanders mentioned in the note were associated with the army of the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian delegation therefore requested the Special Rapporteur to clarify the matter in any future reference to the case.
Mr. PHANIT (Thailand) said that his statement would focus on the problems described in section III (A) of the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism (A/51/301), entitled "The worldwide immigration crisis".
As the report mentioned, it was clear that people usually left heir homelands in search of a better life.
But there were also other reasons why people emigrated.
Some went abroad because of insecurity or persecution in their country and others because their Governments encouraged them to go or because other countries recruited foreign workers.
In most cases, however, poverty appeared to be the main "push factor" behind migratory movements from one country to another in search of better economic opportunities.
Thailand was host to illegal migrants workers while, at the same time, Thai citizens worked illegally in other countries.
Since many of them might be subject to maltreatment, Thailand looked at the problem from both perspectives and tried to address it in a balanced manner, taking into consideration the interests of all concerned.
The problem of immigrants should be considered in all its aspects and human rights should not be used to protect persons guilty of wrongdoing.
People who left their countries were expected to observe the laws and regulations of the host country.
In Thailand's view, the issue of immigration in Asia which the Special Rapporteur discussed in his report was not a problem of racial discrimination.
In Section III, paragraph 22, of his report, the Special Rapporteur had gone too far in citing Thailand as a country which claimed that the presence of immigrants was a threat to the country's security.
Thailand had been host to hundreds of thousands of people arriving from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Viet Nam, including illegal immigrants. It had done so because of its humanitarian tradition and regardless of ethnic origin, religion, colour or race.
Furthermore, the Thai Government's policy on illegal immigrants was clear. It would provide protection and assistance only to those who truly needed them.
Thailand would always try to provide humanitarian assistance and temporary shelter to people who had been displaced across its borders as a result of conflicts in their own countries. When the situation in their home countries returned to normal, however, Thailand would facilitate their return home in safety and dignity.
The number of immigrant workers had increased throughout the country and that increase had negatively affected the economic and social conditions in the country and had also contributed to a dramatic rise in the incidence of crime.
Nevertheless, the problem needed to be addressed in a humane manner. Accordingly, the Government had recently announced a two-year moratorium on the expulsion of illegal immigrants, pending the adoption of regulations to minimize the impact of illegal migration on public order.
Mr. TIN (Myanmar), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, noted with regret that the representative of Ireland, who had spoken on behalf of the European Union on the issue of the right of peoples to self-determination, had made references to Myanmar which were totally irrelevant to the issue under consideration.
Myanmar had played a leading role in the Special Committee on Decolonization, thereby demonstrating its commitment to the right to self-determination for all peoples toiling under the yoke of colonialism.
The Vienna Declaration clearly stated that self-determination should not be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States.
Self-determination was a right applicable only to peoples under colonial domination or alien occupation.
Myanmar was engaged in a broad-based national dialogue aimed at meeting the aspirations of the numerous national ethnic groups in order to create a pluralist, multi-party democracy in a modern and developed State.
In response to the wishes of the people as a whole and of the majority of the political parties, the National Convention had been meeting to draft a new constitution which would guarantee the rights of all national ethnic groups. Priority had been given to national reconciliation among all the races of Myanmar, with the result being that nearly all armed groups had laid down their arms and were now participating fully in the national political process to shape their own destiny.
Detentions and arbitrary arrests were never made in Myanmar.
Action was taken only against those who transgressed existing laws and those arrested had the benefit of all legal guarantees during the judicial proceedings.
Ms. BENNANI (Morocco), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that, in October 1975, at Morocco's request, the International Court of Justice had ruled that the Saharan territory occupied by Spain had not been at the time of its colonization terra nullus and that juridical links and ties of loyalty had existed between the territory and Morocco.
On 14 November 1975, the Saharan territory had been returned to Morocco under the Madrid Agreement, which had been signed between Morocco, Spain and Mauritania.
That Agreement had been officially deposited in the United Nations and the General Assembly had taken note of it.
Despite the problems inherited from the colonial period, Morocco had always sought to recover its territorial integrity in stages and by peaceful means.
As evidence of its desire to achieve a peaceful and lasting solution to the problem of the Sahara, Morocco had taken the initiative to request the United Nations to organize a referendum on self-determination. It had participated actively in all phases of the referendum provided for in the United Nations settlement plan, which had been approved by the Security Council, and had reiterated on numerous occasions its commitment to that plan.
Ms. MESDOUA (Algeria), speaking in exercise of the right of reply, referred to the clarifications which the representative of Morocco had just given on the question of Western Sahara and said that she wished to reiterate once again that the problem should be dealt with by the Security Council and the Fourth Committee.
The Fourth Committee was in fact currently considering the most recent negotiations between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-Hamra y de Río de Oro.
Despite that, Morocco had again attempted to mislead the delegations present in the room.
Algeria reaffirmed its acceptance of the settlement plan approved by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, which called for a just and impartial solution.
In that connection, attention should be drawn, as a number of delegations and, in particular, the representative of the European Union, had done, to the provisions of the Security Council resolutions on the matter.
The meeting rose at 5.15 p.m.

SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 33RD MEETING
Chairman: Mrs. ESPINOSA (Mexico)
CONTENTS
AGENDA ITEM 106: PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. (A/51/41, A/51/90, A/51/306 and Add.1, A/51/385, A/51/424, A/51/456 and A/51/492)
Mrs. SMOLCIC (Uruguay) said that her country was taking an active part in the efforts of the international community, and especially of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, to address the many problems of today's children throughout the world and in particular to find a swift and lasting solution to the problem of children affected by armed conflicts.
Her delegation endorsed the practical recommendations contained in the report, especially the one concerning the appointment of a special representative on the question.
Furthermore, Uruguay attached great importance to the Declaration and Programme of Action of the Stockholm World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and more specifically to the concrete measures proposed therein for promoting cooperation among States, regional organizations and the United Nations with a view inter alia to preventing and eliminating sex tourism.
The presentation of Uruguay's initial report (CRC/C/3/Add.37) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community.
The financial support of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was an important catalyst for the programmes which the Government was establishing and implementing in order to ensure the realization of the rights contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to incorporate its provisions in national law.
However, it was essential for Governments to fulfil the obligations which they had undertaken by ratifying the various relevant international legal instruments.
Mrs. OUEDRAOGO (Burkina Faso) said that the international community could only draw encouragement from the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the holding of the World Summit for Children, the adoption of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, and the Plan of Action produced at the Summit, as well as from the formal commitment of States to guarantee the protection and development of children with greater force and stringency.
Nevertheless, the programmes must be strengthened in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in order to consolidate the achievements.
UNICEF and its various partners should redouble their efforts and rethink their strategies.
In Burkina Faso, despite the effort expended on the implementation of the national action plan, the global objectives had not been achieved with regard to vaccination, combating diarrhoea, use of micro-nutrients and literacy.
The objectives must therefore be revised in order to make them more realistic, the support strategies for the programmes must be strengthened and the national and international partners mobilized to champion the cause of children.
It was also necessary to carry out the recommendations on acceleration of the implementation of the national action plan.
Since the protection and development of children also depended on the success of the strategies and programmes for enhancing the status of women and for their empowerment, emphasis must be given to the link between the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the cooperation between the committees established under those two instruments must be enhanced.
However, for lack of financial resources many strategies and resolutions remained pious wishes.
In many developing countries a very large number of children did not have access to basic social services or even to primary health care and education.
The Bamako Initiative had helped to save many human lives but it required further strengthening.
The organisations and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in particular UNICEF, should be equipped with sufficient financial resources to do their work properly.
Public development aid must be increased in order to satisfy the social needs of the poor within the general framework of the fight against poverty.
The international financial institutions must make greater efforts to devise or support genuine social programmes. In that connection a tribute must
be paid to the efforts of UNICEF to negotiate the cancellation of debt in favour of social programmes and to the 20/20 initiative.
The Secretary-General's Special Initiative for Africa should take into account its mid-decade results in order to focus the programmes better on the areas where serious gaps existed.
Programmes must be launched to increase the awareness of the public and provide it with more information and to create protection networks.
It would be useful for an intergovernmental organ to take a new look at the Declaration and programme of Action of the Stockholm World Congress.
The elimination of the exploitation of child labour would require the adoption of an integrated and more pragmatic approach to improve the cooperation and coordination between Governments and their various partners.
Her delegation endorsed the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General (A/51/492) and encouraged the Committee on the Rights of the Child to give increased attention to the exploitation of child labour in collaboration with the partners mentioned in paragraph 40 of the report.
The recommendations in the report on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1), regarding the five principal sub-topics provided a basis for resolving the injustices, violations and cruelties suffered by children, especially in areas of conflict.
Although it was incumbent upon the Government to protect children in cases of conflict, the international community was also obligated to take spontaneous and coordinated action when the Government no longer functioned.
Her delegation was gravely concerned by the phenomenon of child soldiers and strongly supported the proposal to make 18 the minimum age for recruitment into armed groups or forces.
The international community should support a total ban on the production, use, trading and stockpiling of landmines.
The use of sanctions and embargoes also merited particular attention, as their effects were generally felt most acutely by children and vulnerable groups.
Mr. Kwang Jae LEE (Republic of Korea) said he was encouraged by the unprecedented number of States which had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and by their expression of political will to protect the universal rights of children.
By becoming a party to that indispensable Convention, each Government committed itself to enact new laws and revise existing legislation consistent with the rights and obligations it enumerated.
However, the overall status of children in many parts of the world continued to be a source of grave concern for the international community.
Many of their rights, in particular the right to grow and flourish with dignity in an atmosphere of peace and happiness, were being regularly violated.
The intolerable conditions in which children lived, especially in developing countries, required international cooperation and assistance more urgently than ever before.
The heinous practice of recruiting children into armed conflicts had to be stopped immediately.
At the same time, greater attention had to be paid to the question of child refugees and internally displaced children and to their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
Every year, more than a million innocent children were commercially and sexually abused.
His delegation supported the work of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, welcomed the convening in Stockholm of the World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, and strongly supported the Declaration and Agenda for Action issued at that Congress.
Concerted efforts among Governments, the various bodies and organs of the United Nations and civil society were essential to assure the protection and promotion of the rights of the child in the coming century.
In particular, the role of UNICEF as a leading advocate of children's rights was to be supported and encouraged.
Mr. CHOWDHURY (Bangladesh) said he welcomed the remarkable report presented by the Secretary-General's expert on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1).
Bangladesh fully supported the recommendations contained in the report, in particular those concerning a comprehensive international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, adoption of legal measures to prevent gender-based violence and sexual exploitation, increased commitment for refugee and internally displaced children, and ending the recruitment and participation in combat of child soldiers.
UNICEF country programmes should incorporate appropriate measures to alleviate the situation.
Bangladesh strongly supported the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary-General to ensure follow-up to the report, and called upon the General Assembly to adopt a separate resolution on the report during its current session.
The Stockholm Congress had raised the international community's awareness of the dangers presented by the global problem of commercial sexual exploitation of children.
Urgent national and international action was required not only to combat that heinous crime, but also to address its root causes.
Bangladesh also thanked the Special Rapporteur for her detailed report on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/51/456) which presented a number of useful recommendations.
Programmes relating to children had been given greater focus on the protection of the rights of the child, and efforts undertaken in that context had started to produce tangible results.
Believing that education ensured effective protection and promotion of human rights, including the rights of children, Bangladesh had also made universal access to basic education a priority objective.
Innovative programmes such as "food-for-education" had been adopted to enable children from poor families to attend school and complete at least the primary education cycle.
Bangladesh had also invested heavily in the education of girls, providing them with free education and special stipends to increase enrolment, addressing early drop-outs and eliminating the gender gap in education.
A separate Decade Action Plan for the Girl Child 1991-2000 had been adopted to address the special needs and the development of girl children and to assure their rights by preventing early marriage, child trafficking, violence and sexual exploitation.
Special laws had also been passed to address crimes committed against women and children such as dowry-related violence, rape, kidnapping and trafficking.
The problem of child labour was a corollary of poverty in developing countries.
Bangladesh had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF with a view to eradicating child labour from the garment industry, which was one of the largest employers of children.
The Memorandum provided that children would be sent to school and training centres and receive stipends.
Those efforts appeared to have been successful and could serve as a model for other countries in similar conditions.
Their full implementation would nevertheless require the continued support of the international community and donor agencies.
The ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by 187 States was testimony to the resolve of the international community to protect the rights of the child.
Nevertheless, international efforts aimed at providing the assistance and additional resources needed to reinforce and sustain national efforts should also be intensified.
In order to ensure effective implementation of the Convention, States should submit their reports on time and establish national implementation mechanisms that reflected national situations and aspirations, and also engage in effective networking at the national and global levels with a view to increasing awareness and promoting effective implementation of the Convention.
Believing that the discussion of such an important question should have the highest level of participation of United Nations bodies, he expressed his disappointment that no representatives of ILO and the Centre for Human Rights were present at the meeting.
Convened on the initiative of the non-governmental organization End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT), the World Congress had assembled Governments and non-governmental organizations on an equal footing and provided the opportunity for forming a global partnership based on cooperation between States and non-governmental organizations (which was essential to achievement of the objective), between international bodies, such as UNICEF, the Centre for Human Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and between national and international law enforcement authorities.
It also reminded all participants of the common obligation of States under article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and created an international momentum that should give new impetus to the international fight against the sexual exploitation of children.
Its contribution to defending the rights of children should be recognized in the omnibus resolution on the rights of the child to be adopted by the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.
Mr. BALL (New Zealand) said that, in the context of preparing its initial report for submission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 1997, his Government had ensured that its existing legislation was in conformity with its obligations as a State Party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
He noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child would be unable to do its important work without sufficient resources.
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General's Expert on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1) and hoped that, in accordance with its recommendations, the international community would reclaim children as "zones of peace".
He also hoped that all Governments would support the adoption of an international instrument banning the production and use of anti-personnel landmines.
In April 1996, his Government had declared a unilateral moratorium on the use of such mines by the New Zealand defence force.
Believing that the recruitment of child soldiers should be prevented, his Government would continue to play an active role in the Working Group established by the Commission on Human Rights to develop an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that dealt with children in armed conflict.
Referring to another area where the protection of children should be strengthened, he indicated that his Government would also continue to play an active role in the Working Group established by the Commission on Human Rights to consider an optional protocol to the Convention that would deal with the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.
His Government acknowledged the valuable role of UNICEF and was looking forward to becoming a member of its Executive Board in early 1997.
Its key aim would be to ensure that UNICEF continued to operate as efficiently as possible.
It was essential to ensure that the commitments made at the World Summit for Children were fulfilled.
With a view to establishing a useful base for its future activities, his Government had prepared a report on the status of children in New Zealand and on initiatives to assist children and their families.
Cooperation between Governments, international institutions, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations was essential for the promotion and protection of the rights of children.
The main value of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/51/456) and of the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm, resided in their having raised the awareness of the international community about the alarming proportions of the phenomenon of child abuse, which now occurred in all regions of the world.
Her country had always been an ardent defender of children's rights, as shown by the many legislative and constitutional provisions relating to the protection of children that had been adopted in implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which it had ratified in 1989.
Children occupied a central place in national development programmes, and measures had been taken for the achievement by the year 2000 of the goals set at the World Summit for Children, particularly in the areas of prevention, strengthening existing mechanisms, raising public awareness and education, particularly of girls and women.
While the United Nations was doing remarkable work on behalf of children, there was no substitute for the will of States to mobilize at all levels in order to eradicate the problems affecting children.
Ms. CALCETAS-SANTOS (Special Rapport of the Commission on Human Rights on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography) said that she had sought in the first part of her report (A/51/456) to give a brief overview of the causes and characteristics of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, the profiles of the victims and the abusers and the impact of sexual exploitation on children, all of which were key elements in any attempt to form policies and plans of action.
The whole world was now aware that child abuse was happening throughout the world and was often systematic.
The States participating in the World Congress had adopted a Declaration and Agenda for Action in which they had pledged to take positive action to eradicate such exploitation.
At long last, therefore, the political will that had been lacking up to then seemed to have emerged.
Nevertheless, even those countries which were the most strongly determined to combat the sexual exploitation of children and in the best position to do so might be daunted by the magnitude of the problems or might fall into the trap of believing in a non-existent magic formula.
For that reason, chapter V of the report presented recommendations to governments on the steps that might be followed to address the problems more systematically at the national level, which could be changed, modified or improved upon as the situation warranted.
Such steps consisted of analysing the causes of the concern and the problems which it raised in the context of the country concerned. They also consisted of drawing up an inventory of current and potential resources, namely, the statutory framework, available funds and possible partners.
With regard to the statutory framework, all programmes and strategies must take into account the legal framework of the country concerned.
It was therefore essential that there should be a review of all existing laws having an impact on the welfare of children in general and exploited and abused children in particular. That would also lead to a determination of gaps and inadequacies, which could, in turn, be the basis for recommendations for legislative action.
With regard to substantive laws, the following were some of the questions that must be answered: What were the elements of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography? Who was subject to criminal culpability for each of those offences?
With regard to procedural rules, the following questions would be helpful: Was there confidentiality especially of the identity of the child in all stages? Were there rules to preclude undue influence on the child (A/51/456, paras. 46 and 47)?
The reporting mechanisms for abuse should likewise be examined, since easy access to complaint mechanisms was vital in order to encourage recourse to the justice system and ensure the success of child protection measures.
With regard to the determination of available funds, it was imperative to review the funds available before any measures were implemented.
Moreover, if States were to upgrade children's concerns in the order of priorities, they would have to allocate a larger share of their budgets to that effort.
Lastly, other sources of funding should be tapped to supplement the resources currently available.
The identification of possible partners was essential, as governments could never tackle the problems alone.
Lastly, as had been evident at all the conferences which she had attended, the justice system had a crucial role to play in the fight against child abuse; for that reason, a special focus on the justice system was contained in chapter VI of the report.
In conclusion, she wished to point out that while the problem of the commercial sexual exploitation of children was of crucial importance, there was another problem with which it was inextricably linked and which also required urgent attention, namely, the non-commercial sexual exploitation of children, particularly incest.
She was confident that the international community would take steps to alleviate those problems in the near future.
Mr. ROBINSON (United States of America) said that, year in and year out, United Nations agencies, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations, bilateral donors and host governments, had provided emergency relief, health care and clean water and contributed to economic and social development in many countries.
They also sought to protect children against violence by promoting policies consistent with the best interests of the child, good governance and national reconciliation.
As evidenced by its financial support, his country strongly endorsed those activities, which were the most effective way for the United Nations to make a difference in the lives of the world's children.
The success of the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children could be attributed not only to the nature of the issues involved, but also to the effective approach adopted by its organizers, which could be emulated in the planning of other gatherings.
The adoption of the Declaration and Agenda for Action had been facilitated by pre-conference consultations.
The exchanges of views among non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and governments had also been particularly fruitful.
His delegation hoped that the recommendations in the report would result in action.
It doubted the usefulness, however, of appointing a separate special representative, as the report recommended, to monitor children caught up in armed conflicts.
The United States shared the concerns expressed in the report on the potential effects of economic sanctions on vulnerable populations, especially children.
It had regularly supported humanitarian exceptions in sanctions regimes for that reason.
However, the United States disagreed with the report's implicit assumption that it was the sanctions themselves that harmed children in sanctioned countries; rather, it was their Governments' choices of social priorities and their callous decision to disregard the needs of children and use their sufferings as political leverage.
It was obvious that structural adjustment programmes alone would not provide a long-term solution to poverty and inequality.
However, sound public programmes of investment in human capital and basic services would generate more resources and make better use of them for the benefit of all, including children.
For the past three years, the United States Department of Labor had been doing research on child labour worldwide.
Its first two reports had sensitized the United States public to the horrific conditions under which children worked in different countries.
The third study had pointed to some advances, particularly in the garment industry.
Efforts must be reinforced to combat the exploitation of children by providing resources for education and law enforcement and doing more to make the exploitative employment of children profitable.
The members of the international community must work together, putting ideology, politics and rhetoric aside, so that children could live in peace in a more humane and prosperous world.
Mr. LEWIS (Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Children's Fund) apologized for the absence of the Executive Director, who had been obliged to go to the Great Lakes region to organize assistance.
UNICEF had already spoken on the situation of children involved in armed conflict, on street children, the sexual exploitation of children, child labour and the education and emancipation of girls, and he would limit his remarks to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, underscoring the remarkable impact its implementation had had.
Its ratification by 187 States had led government authorities to take concrete steps.
The ethical and social principles set out in the Convention and the legal framework it provided were being scrutinized throughout the world.
On every continent, its implementation had spurred debates on the problems of indigenous children and young people, the education of girls, the media, the progress made and the procedures for preparing State party reports.
The Convention would also be at the centre of the debates on child labour that would be held in 1997, just as it had been central to the study done by the expert of the Secretary-General in document A/51/306 and Add.1.
In the course of all the discussions, children had had their say.
By testifying themselves against sexual exploitation, prostitution, violence, genital mutilation, the lack of access to education, slavery, gender inequality, armed conflict, and, above all, poverty, they had touched Governments.
As a result, nations the world over were modifying their policies, their constitutions, their legislation and the way in which they administered juvenile justice, to reflect the provisions of the Convention.
The Governments of the industrialized and the developing countries were taking up questions they had never before considered.
If all that had been possible, it was thanks to the action of institutions like UNICEF, but especially to the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
By developing guidelines for the preparation of State party reports and the comments on the reports it received, the Committee was establishing a jurisprudence in the field of the rights of the child.
It played a central role in the work being done by United Nations bodies, Governments, non-governmental organizations and all those who were struggling to promote the rights of the child.
By putting the Convention into effect, Governments were not simply implementing a binding legal instrument but were changing the living conditions of children. That was why the decisions taken by the members of the Third Committee were crucial.
Archbishop MARTINO (Observer for the Holy See) said that, as Pope John Paul II had stated in his message on the occasion of the 1996 World Day of Peace, the Catholic Church had always been one of the primary providers of care for children.
The report on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1) not only brought out the sufferings that were imposed on children, but the impact that such suffering could have on the nature of the societies in which the children were to live. It was not enough for children to survive.
Children must be allowed to thrive if the world of the future was to be a better one.
The report made the point that by destroying the structure of the family, armed conflicts undermined the very basis of human society, depriving children of love, strength and the values of those around them and abandoning them to themselves.
The report described particularly well the situation of children recruited by armies or militias.
It showed the need to maintain family unity for refugees and internally displaced children, the need for an international ban on landmines, the impact of sanctions, and the need to provide children with food and education in order to restore normalcy to their lives.
Children were forced not only to take on adult responsibilities but were abducted from their world of imagination and hope and were forced into actual combat, prostitution and hate.
The lessons of the report on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1) were certainly applicable to innumerable other tragedies facing children, whether as victims of commercial or sexual exploitation, or suffering from lethal illnesses such HIV/AIDS.
The ethical nature of any solutions offered to such problems should be examined, as the world was being sucked into a desolate moral vacuum.
In that regard, the Holy See reaffirmed its opposition to abortion and its practice as a dimension of reproductive health services.
The Holy See believed that support should be given to families everywhere, in order to increase the care of all children.
In particular, the needs of families living in destitution, displaced by war and suffering disease, should be identified in order to promote the rights of children.
Mr. LOREL (International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)) referred to the study of the expert appointed by the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1).
ICRC strongly supported the adoption of preventive and curative measures to tackle the problem.
In order to promote raising the age of conscription to 18, it had requested the preparation and implementation of a plan of action aimed at promoting the principle of non-participation and non-recruitment of children under 18 in armed conflicts and at taking specific measures to protect and assist children who were victims of armed conflicts.
In January 1996, during the meeting of the working group responsible for drafting an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to the participation of children in armed conflicts, ICRC had deemed it essential that the protocol should be respected by all parties to a conflict, even if the conflict was non-international, because it was in that type of situation that children ran the greatest risks. It was often forgotten that the international humanitarian law applicable in such cases bound all parties concerned without giving them juridical status.
Moreover, ICRC believed that the draft optional protocol should forbid all forms of direct or indirect participation of children in conflicts.
A prohibition of that type already appeared in the provisions of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions. Any exception to that rule would only weaken the Additional Protocol.
Furthermore, experience in the field had proved that it was almost impossible to establish a distinction between the two forms of participation.
Based on its experience, ICRC knew that only preventive measures, especially in the fields of health and education, could improve the protection of children involved in an armed conflict and guarantee their non-participation in hostilities.
However, emergency assistance could not have a lasting preventive effect, and long-term solutions therefore needed to be developed. That was mainly the responsibility of States, but humanitarian organizations could make a contribution.
In the light of the meagre resources available and the scope of the needs, it was indispensable to mobilize the whole international community.
Mrs. ENKHTSETSEG (Mongolia) said that, although the United Nations had done a great deal for children since its creation, a large number of children throughout the world still faced threats to their survival and development.
In order to resolve the problem, it was indispensable to proceed methodically and systematically analyse each and every threat to a child's survival.
The expert appointed by the Secretary-General should be congratulated for the extensive appraisal of the impact of armed conflict on children in her report (A/51/306 and Add.1) and for having drawn up a very comprehensive agenda for action to improve the protection of such children.
She supported the recommendations, especially those aimed at prohibiting the participation of children below the age of 18 in armed conflicts and at establishing a special representative of the Secretary-General with the mandate to study the impact of armed conflicts on children and to coordinate follow-up to the report.
The globalization of the sale of children and child prostitution was another issue which should be dealt with urgently.
Her delegation believed that Member States should attentively study the recommendations set out in the Agenda for Action adopted by the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (A/51/385) and in the report of the Special Rapporteur on that issue (A/51/456), with a view to incorporating them into national agendas tailored to children.
It also believed that those recommendations should be taken into account in the draft omnibus resolution on the rights of the child that the General Assembly would adopt during the current session.
It was heartening that almost all States had become parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the main international pillar for the protection and promotion of children's rights, but that was not sufficient; it should be universally applied.
Moreover, the amendment aimed at increasing the membership of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to 18, adopted on 12 December 1995 by the Conference of States Parties to the Convention and approved by the General Assembly in resolution 50/155, should be accepted by the greatest possible number of States Parties.
Mongolia was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention.
When the Committee on the Rights of the Child had examined Mongolia's initial report on the application of the Convention in January 1996, it had noted with satisfaction that the Government of Mongolia gave a high priority to issues regarding children and had allocated 20 per cent of its national budget to education.
However, it also noted that, as a result of political and economic difficulties, poverty and unemployment were increasing and the situation of children had deteriorated.
It had therefore recommended that the Government should strengthen coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children's rights and ensure closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations.
It had also suggested that the Government should establish a multidisciplinary monitoring system to assess the progress achieved and the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the rights recognized by the Convention and, in particular, to monitor regularly the effects of economic changes on children.
She indicated that the Government had taken note of those recommendations and intended to follow up on them, in close cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, UNICEF, ILO, UNHCR and other agencies of the United Nations system.
It also wished to mention that, following the national programme of action for the development of children in the 1990s, prepared as a follow-up to the World Summit for Children, in May 1996 the Mongolian Government had enacted new laws aimed at protecting the rights of the child.
Mr. MISHRA (Nepal) said that his delegation strongly supported the measures taken by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; it urged all States which had not yet done so to ratify the Convention and those States which had reservations on some provisions to withdraw those reservations.
It believed that the Committee on the Rights of the Child should be expanded to 18 members to put it at par with the committees responsible for the implementation of other international conventions.
He welcomed the report on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/51/456) and felt that all the recommendations made in it should be carefully considered and implemented.
The practice of using children as soldiers must also be stopped, as well as the production, stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines, which killed and maimed a large number of children.
Efforts must likewise be made to protect children from exposure to deadly diseases like AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
His delegation fully supported the work of the open-ended working group to elaborate a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on children in armed conflict.
It felt that the recommendations made in document A/51/456 must be carefully considered and implemented and it was grateful to the Government of Sweden for convening the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in August 1996; the Declaration and Agenda for Action adopted at the Congress were a significant reference document.
Nepal had been one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
In 1992 it had enacted laws on children and labour which incorporated fundamental principles of the Convention.
His Government attached great importance to the education of children, particularly girls, and to child and maternal health care.
It was striving to eliminate discriminatory practices against girls and women that were traditional in Nepalese society through education, literacy programmes and the dissemination of information.
It was in the process of taking legislative and other measures to promote and protect the rights of the child.
Mr. NAJEM (Lebanon) said that after signing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children at the World Summit for Children, his Government, through the supreme council on children, had developed a global plan of action for the survival, protection and development of children in all areas.
In respect of health, the plan of action provided, in accordance with article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that no child could be denied the right of access to medical services.
In accordance with articles 28 and 29 of the Convention, the plan of action aimed to make primary education available and free to all and make higher education accessible to all.
With regard to the protection of children, psychosociological education programmes were to be organized, an "education for peace" module was to be introduced in school programmes, radio and television programmes were to be monitored to eliminate all references to violence, and children were to be protected against the dangers of drug use and drug trafficking and against sexual violence and exploitation through the application of existing laws and the strengthening of criminal penalties.
Furthermore, the term "illegitimate child" would be removed from civil registry documents, with retroactive effect.
The supreme council on children had undertaken to verify the conformity of Lebanese laws with the Convention on the Rights of the Child in order to amend any provisions which were not in conformity with the Convention and propose new bills to the National Assembly.
Lebanon, which had only just emerged from war, had made the objectives of the Convention on the Rights of the Child priorities that it would strive to implement progressively.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child must continue to play an important role and its conclusions must have the authority of the entire United Nations; its recommendations, based on the study of country reports, must serve as a basis for international cooperation in the defense and protection of children.
The World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, adopted at the World Summit for Children, had given further impetus to that cooperation.
The World Conference on Human Rights had underscored the commitment of the international community to the principle "Children first" and stressed the importance of active efforts at the national and international levels.
The Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, various United Nations bodies and civil society all played a role in the protection and defence of the rights of the child.
The Russian Federation, for its part, had drawn up a national plan for children which had been approved by a decree of the President of the Russian Federation of 14 September 1995.
The plan aimed, in particular, to align domestic legislation with the provisions of the Convention, define priorities in areas such as strengthening the legal protection of the child, support for the family, risk-free maternity and the protection of child health, improvement of nutrition, education and development of the child and assistance to children in especially difficult circumstances.
It also provided for special measures for the reincorporation in society of child victims of armed conflicts, violence and prostitution, and child refugees.
Those measures supplemented other programmes launched by the President.
It was important for the protection of the rights of children to better publicize the provisions and principles contained in the Convention; the United Nations should also assist States Parties in implementing that instrument, and rapporteurs, special representatives and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights and its bodies must cooperate with each other.
The Russian Federation welcomed the recommendations made by the Commission on Human Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and believed that their implementation would facilitate a comprehensive approach to those problems both within the United Nations and at other levels.
Ms. AHOUNOU (Côte d'Ivoire) said that the declaration adopted at the World Summit for Children in 1990 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, unanimously adopted by the General Assembly in 1989 and ratified by almost all Member States, indicated that questions relating to children were of universal importance.
That importance was very apparent to African countries, which made major sacrifices to improve the living conditions of their children.
However, while they had succeeded in making progress (the vaccination rate had more than doubled in more than 25 countries and the objective of vaccinating 75 per cent of infants had been attained), it was still the case that more than a third of the 40,000 children who died every day in the world were African, a figure explained by wars, the lack of health care and the deterioration in economic conditions brought about by the brutal fall in commodity prices and structural adjustment measures.
Aware that there could be no progress without human development, Côte d'Ivoire accorded priority in its development strategy to all matters affecting children. Thus it devoted 47 per cent of its budget to education, it had made school attendance compulsory to the age of 14, and it had more than 2 million children in its schools.
In Côte d'Ivoire, as in almost all African countries, the lack of financial resources prevented Governments from promoting and defending the rights of children as much as was needed.
The economic crisis and the constraints imposed by multilateral financial institutions drained social affairs, health and education budgets.
Her delegation thus appealed once more to the international community to assist the most disadvantaged countries to improve the situation of children and to attain the objectives established at the World Summit for Children in 1990.
Lastly, her delegation welcomed the report of the expert appointed by the Secretary-General on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/51/456), and agreed with her that it was absolutely essential to avert armed conflict to prevent millions of children from becoming further victims of the worst atrocities.
Education reflecting tolerance, peace, social justice and respect for human rights would be a good means of bringing that about.
Mr. HAMDOON (Iraq) said that, since the Second World War, the international community had adopted various instruments, such as the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, with a view to ensuring that children did not suffer further tragic situations and to assuring their well-being.
That was also the objective of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1993, had called on all States to ratify.
For its part, Iraq had enacted legislation for the protection of children, in particular relating to minors, social protection, compulsory education and the protection of adolescents.
His Government had acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1994, and had used that instrument as a basis for the formulation of an action plan intended to prepare children for effective participation in community life.
His delegation had participated in the negotiations in the Working Group on the preparation of a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the participation of children in armed conflicts.
It was unfortunate that more than 50 years after a solemn commitment by the international community there were children in the world who lived on the streets, exposed to drugs and sexual exploitation, and who were the victims of armed conflict and famine.
The use of economic sanctions, particularly against developing countries, had increased over the current decade.
Thus, for six years Iraq had been suffering under iniquitous international sanctions of unprecedented severity.
The Executive Director of UNICEF, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Executive Director of the World Food Programme had recently stated that some 4,500 Iraqi children under five years of age were dying each month.
They had not spoken of the many children over five years of age or of the adults dying each day as a result of the deteriorating situation in Iraq, largely owing to famine and protein deficiencies.
While many international instruments prohibited the use of hunger and disease as means of political pressure, the question arose of whether all countries were equal or whether different criteria could apply according to political objectives, denying Iraqi children the right to live as granted to other children in the world.
As many United Nations agencies had stated, the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq was not limited to the frightening number of deaths which it had caused among children, women and the elderly, since in fact an entire generation of Iraqis had been sacrificed as a result of the difficulties they had encountered in terms of education and health and other social spheres.
The way in which sanctions had been imposed cast doubt on the credibility of the Organization as well as on the morality of the international instruments it had adopted.
Further, the honour of the Organization was impugned because the States which dominated the Security Council mocked it by using it as a tool for their own political designs, which had no relationship to the purposes of the Organization, namely the maintenance of international peace and security and international cooperation.
The systematic efforts to annihilate 20 million Iraqis were contrary to all international instruments, which must lead the international community to consider economic sanctions as an internationally prohibited weapon of mass destruction, since the application of sanctions against Iraq had caused significantly more victims than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, which was ironic in the extreme given the degree of interest currently evinced in human rights.
Mrs. WAHBI (Sudan) said that children were the main victims of poverty in developing countries.
In its report on the situation of children in the world, UNICEF emphasized that the international community must intensify its efforts to improve the fate of children, who represented the future.
The fact that the Convention on the Rights of the Child had been almost universally ratified clearly indicated that States were now aware of the importance of children.
That awareness must, however, be translated into facts. Although most States had already taken some specific measures, international cooperation was essential if developing countries were to be helped to implement the Convention.
The Sudan had been one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention, since Islam required that those rights should be respected.
Her Government had established a schedule for the implementation of the Convention and had set targets for children's education and health, amongst other things.
It had also signed peace agreements with some of the warring parties in the south of the country to restore stability to the Sudan and eliminate the causes of population displacements, of which children were the main victims.
A symposium had been organized in Khartoum in June 1996, in collaboration with UNICEF, to adopt measures to help Sudanese children.
Her Government was especially concerned by the situation of children in the south of the country.
It condemned the use of children as human shields by rebel forces and urged the international community to denounce such practices, which were against international law and humanitarian principles.
She welcomed the report on the impact of armed conflict on children (A/51/306 and Add.1) drafted by the expert appointed by the Secretary-General, and emphasized the need to produce, as soon as possible, the definitive version of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child related to the involvement of children in armed conflicts.
It was also necessary to address the issue of abandoned children, by registering them and ensuring that they were reunited with their families or taken into care by their local communities.
Her delegation condemned the sale and sexual exploitation of children and supported the decisions of the Stockholm Congress.
The international community should assist the developing countries in their fight against poverty and in their efforts to protect children so that they could enjoy a normal childhood.
It was also necessary to review the situation of children in countries which were subject to economic sanctions and to promote international cooperation, which was the only way to protect the rights of the child.
Ms. GORDON (Jamaica) welcomed the two detailed, high-calibre reports submitted on problems concerning children (A/51/306 and Add.1 and A/51/456).
Jamaica was no stranger to violence, which was partly a legacy of slavery and colonialism; it was a particularly acute problem in the cities and its main victims were children.
An increase in the number of violent crimes committed by young people had also been observed.
To combat that violence, her Government had recently introduced a programme, called "Peace and love in schools", to encourage children to find alternatives to violence for the resolution of conflicts, and which owed its success to the fact that the children provided counselling to one another.
Faced with the growing exploitation and abuse of children, her delegation welcomed the interim report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/51/456), particularly chapter V, which provided an analysis of that very complex issue and listed possible solutions available to States.
With the expansion of tourism, there was a growing concern in Jamaica about the sexual exploitation of children.
Accordingly, her country had taken part in the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and unreservedly supported its call to put an end to that practice.
Her Government, in partnership with UNICEF and other United Nations and international agencies, non-governmental organizations and civil society, had been working to address the plight of street children, who were particularly vulnerable and susceptible to prostitution and other ills, and the plight of other children in especially difficult circumstances.
Jamaica's new country programme, which it had just finalized in partnership with UNICEF, was based on the recognition that poverty lay at the root of most of the problems affecting Jamaican children.
The programme therefore focused on deprived groups and under-serviced geographical areas, and had four main components: (i) basic education and early childhood development; (ii) social policy for children and women; (iii) children and youth at risk (that component was designed to provide education to some 40,000 out-of-school children, provide outreach services to 2,500 children, and reintegrate institutionalized children with their families, or place them with foster parents; and (iv) decentralized community development for children.
The programme also provided for legal and policy reform as well as the strengthening of institutions providing services for children.
Her Government was aware that its efforts could only be successful of the children themselves took part in the programmes developed for their benefit, and that all Jamaicans, including children, needed to be educated in the rights of the child as defined in the Convention and in Jamaican law, which had been amended to bring it into line with the Convention.
In May 1996, to celebrate "Child month", Jamaica had staged a children's parliament, where role-playing children and young people addressed their views to parliamentarians and legislators.
Mrs. LIMJUCO (Philippines) recalled that the international community had set itself the target of ensuring the well-being of children by the year 2000.
Shortly after ratifying the Convention, her Government had launched a national plan of action for children covering the period 1990 to 1992.
Also, in 1992, it had adopted the plan of action entitled "The Filipino child: 2000 and beyond".
In the same year it had passed R.A.#7610, the Special Protection of Children against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
Her Government had also hosted, from 27 to 29 September 1996, the East Asia and Pacific Ministerial Consultation on Goals for Children and Development in the 1990s.
Lastly, on 14 September 1995, in response to the growing number of cases of child abuse, Executive Order 275 created a committee for the special protection of children from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development.
The committee was composed of top officials, heads of various departments and three representatives of non-governmental organizations.
It reported directly to the President on measures taken to address those issues and ordered government agencies to respond immediately to problems brought to their attention and to report back to the committee.
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

(e) REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (continued) (A/51/36)
Mr. HAMMARBERG (Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia), reporting to the Committee, said that his mandate was to maintain contact with the Government and people of Cambodia, to guide and coordinate the United Nations human rights presence in Cambodia and to assist the Government in the promotion and protection of human rights.
During his mission to Cambodia he had had meetings with leading representatives of the Administration and the judiciary, parliamentarians, members of civil society and non-governmental organizations working to promote human rights.
The existence in Cambodia of an office of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and its collaboration with other United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) had made it possible to coordinate activities and had contributed significantly to the progress made.
The aim of the direct discussions with the Government was to assist it to develop a human rights culture and build effective safeguards against violations.
Technical and financial support from the international community was necessary to improve the situation.
The Cambodian Constitution explicitly protected the rights of the child.
A Cambodian National Council for the Children, with non-governmental participation, had been set up to coordinate child-related programmes.
Human rights education had been incorporated in the curricula of the primary and secondary schools, and the Government was drafting a report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and maintaining constructive cooperation with UNICEF.
However, child prostitution and trafficking in children were becoming a serious problem.
A law providing heavy sentences for kidnapping, trafficking, sale and exploitation of human beings had been adopted but had not yet entered into force for lack of a detailed implementing decree.
The attempts made to combat child prostitution were being undermined by private interests.
There was therefore a need for an awareness campaign to fight against that abuse, for which international cooperation was required.
Many children were the casualties of land mines, which beyond the deaths and injuries they caused, had serious repercussions on the economy.
Despite admirable mine-clearance efforts, there was much work ahead and international support was indispensable.
Although the Government had stopped importing anti-personnel mines, no law prohibiting the production, stockpiling and use of land mines had yet been adopted.
The functioning of the justice system was another basic problem.
The courts were badly equipped and judges badly paid, which endangered their independence.
In order to raise professional standards in the field of human rights and the administration of justice, the Center for Human Rights ran a judicial mentor programme providing judges with training that the Government would like to have extended also to local civilian and military police, prison personnel and local authorities.
The judiciary had to deal with the challenge of impunity.
De facto impunity seemed to stem from the entrenched power of the armed forces and the police.
De jure impunity stemmed from a 1994 civil service law, article 51 of which stipulated that except in cases of flagrante delicto, no civil servant could be arrested or prosecuted for any crime without the prior consent of the Government or of the minister concerned.
Article 51 had been found contrary to the basic principle of equality of all persons under the law.
It was therefore significant that the Second Prime Minister in the Administration had indicated that he supported its repeal.
Some structural problems also needed to be addressed.
The Supreme Council of Magistracy, which had been set up in 1994 to appoint, transfer and discipline judges and prosecutors, had yet to meet, and no law had been drafted to define the organization and operation of the Constitutional Council.
As a result, there was no legal forum in Cambodia to determine the constitutionality of various proposed laws.
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair, and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral.
Nonetheless, Cambodia ought to adopt laws concerning the electoral code, the right to form a political party and the Constitutional Council.
An independent electoral commission was indispensable for the conduct of the elections and would allow political violence to be averted.
Some of the opposition parties and some journalists had been attacked and intimidated, yet no suspects had been identified, arrested or prosecuted.
In spite of the enormous difficulties inherited from the past, Cambodia was developing and building for the future.
Most parts of the country were at peace, and dynamic non-governmental organizations were taking part in the effort.
However, the situation was fragile, and the coming elections would be both a challenge and a difficult test for the country.
Mr. VAN DER STOEL (Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq) informed the Committee that the indiscriminate bombardment and the tank assault against civilian settlements by Iraqi troops, as well as the wave of arbitrary arrests and summary executions and the massacres that had followed, had caused many deaths and injuries and a great deal of damage in northern Iraq, where the Iraqi security services had become entrenched, to the great fear of the population.
The use of excessive force on that occasion, clearly on the orders of the Iraqi Government, was in violation of the norms of international law and international human rights instruments.
Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government, which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military, but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country, which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime.
Such practices were contrary to the obligations undertaken by Iraq under international humanitarian law, which prohibited all discrimination with regard to access to food and health care.
Noting with interest the announcement, on 12 September 1996, that the internal embargo imposed by the Government against the north had been lifted, an embargo which it had always denied before, the Special Rapporteur said that, in view of the Government's record, the United Nations was entitled to call for the establishment of an independent monitoring mechanism for the implementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995) and, in particular, of the "food for oil" formula (which, after years of delay, the Iraqi Government had finally decided to accept), in order to ensure that the food thus obtained went to those most in need of it.
While, under the memorandum of understanding signed by the United Nations and Iraq in order to permit the sale of billions of dollars of oil in order to purchase the food and medicine which the Iraqi population desperately needed, the United Nations duly acknowledged Iraqi sovereignty over its territory and resources, Iraq, in turn, should accept the stationing of an adequate number of qualified monitors throughout the country with complete freedom of movement.
With regard to the nature of the Iraqi political regime, the Special Rapporteur said that the March 1996 elections had provided further evidence that the basis of authority of Iraq was not the general will of the people since the candidates in those elections had been chosen by States bodies and all elected deputies had had to swear their support for the principles of the Baath Party.
Furthermore, the 30 deputies representing northern Iraq had not been elected by the population, but had been appointed by the President of the Republic, who, as the President of the Republic, Chairman of the Revolution Command Council, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Secretary-General of the Baath Party and head of security, held all the power in the country.
Referring to the systematic use of enforced disappearances by the Iraqi regime to instil fear in every citizen, the Special Rapporteur said that there were 17,000 individual cases of disappearance from all over the country and over 600 cases of Kuwaiti and third-country nationals who were still missing six years after they had been arrested by the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait.
In the vast majority of cases, the Iraqi Government had not seen fit to respond to requests for information by the families, who were confronted with uncertainty about the fate of their disappeared relatives.
The United Nations should not allow the Government of Iraq to ignore so brazenly its obligations under international law.
Pending the submission of his more detailed and comprehensive final report to the fifty-third session of the Commission on Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur concluded that, in order to put an end to the suffering of the population and enable it to enjoy its economic, social and cultural rights, the Iraqi Government must immediately cease its repression, abrogate its cruel laws, dismantle its security apparatus and cooperate with the United Nations to implement the Security Council resolutions and particularly the "food for fuel" formula without further delay in order to promote peace and security in the country and the region.
Mr. AL-HUMAIMIDI (Iraq) expressed regret that the Special Rapporteur had merely repeated the same accusations that were as resolutely hostile to Iraq as those of previous years, instead of demonstrating the non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity required of his position, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 50/174.
Refuting the so-called reliable sources of the Special Rapporteur as being linked to other States or in the pay of the United States secret services, the representative of Iraq said that the accusations concerning the violation of the political and civil rights of the Iraqi population by means of laws imposing cruel and inhuman penalties, which those sources had reported, were totally groundless since those laws had been repealed, as the Centre for Human Rights and other international bodies could confirm.
Those accusations as well as the references by the Special Rapporteur to the nature of the political regime in Iraq were based on an obvious desire to tarnish the country's reputation.
How else could one explain the refusal by the Special Rapporteur to recognize the good will of the Iraqi Government demonstrated by the fact that it had declared a general amnesty in the Kurdish autonomous region, pardoned persons sentenced to death, set up people's councils and organized a referendum to designate the President of the Republic in order to strengthen respect for human rights and democracy in the country.
In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care, his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination, which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm.
The delay in implementing Security Council resolution 986 (1995) and particularly the "food for oil" formula was explained by the slow pace of the negotiations on the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and Iraq, which was due to the endless interference and delaying manoeuvres by the United States authorities, who had aggravated the sufferings of the Iraqi people and infringed their basic rights, particularly the right to life, personal security, food and adequate health care, education and other social services, all the while casting the blame on the Iraqi Government.
On the other hand, the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life, an attack that had been condemned by the international community, constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State.
Mr. DEGNI-SEGUI (Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights) said that he had been on mission to Rwanda from 18 to 21 October 1996 in order to investigate the genocide, human rights violations and the problem of the return of the refugees.
The genocide gave rise to two distinct possibilities: the investigation of it and the legal action taken against the perpetrators.
The investigation had been conducted on two levels: the first, consisting in determining the profound causes of the hostilities, which were at once political, historical, economic, social and cultural; and the second, which concerned the particular situation of vulnerable groups, namely women (the victims of rape, which had been a weapon of war with all the resulting psychological and social turmoil), children, who had frequently been used by the belligerents as instruments for carrying out their crimes but were also innocent victims, and the Twa minority group, which had been the target of the two parties to the conflict.
As far as proceedings were concerned, despite very modest achievements (the International Tribunal for Rwanda had begun the trials on 26 September 1996, Rwandan courts had been re-established, States of asylum had initiated proceedings against the presumed perpetrators), it should be noted that only 25 out of 400 suspects had been indicted and that none of the presumed perpetrators had been brought to trial.
The basic reason for that situation was the failure of States providing refuge to the presumed perpetrators to cooperate, despite the recommendations to that effect in Security Council resolution 978 (1995).
Such failure to prosecute the presumed perpetrators of the genocide was morally and socially unacceptable to the international community in general and to the victims of the genocide in particular.
That distressing situation was compounded by the concern over the increase in human rights violations.
It was true that violations of property rights were declining, with disputes over vacant property being estimated by the country's authorities at 10 per cent.
Moreover, such disputes were basically limited to the large towns and to the region of Bugesera.
That improvement was attributable to the construction of dwellings and the management of vacant property by the burgomasters who rented it to repatriated former refugees.
However, the situation could be complicated by a massive return of people.
Violations of the freedom of expression took the form of censorship, intimidation, violations of physical integrity, abductions and assassinations.
There was a relative decline in the violations of the right to personal security (arbitrary arrests and detentions of persons accused of participation in the genocide), interspersed with two periods of political tension which had led to a wave of arrests. First, the April/May 1996 round of censuses had touched off a hunt for the perpetrators of the genocide. Second, there had been the July/August searches aimed at finding and arresting infiltrators, pursuant to the Act of 8 September 1996 amending the Code of Penal Procedure, based on article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to legalize the practice of arbitrary arrests and detentions.
Despite the construction of prisons and the rehabilitation of existing detention centres, such arrests had worsened overcrowding in prisons, triggering a more than threefold increase in the number of inmates.
Violations of the right to physical integrity and to life, which had declined somewhat in 1996, had increased from June onwards because of the activities of infiltrators, who had carried out acts of sabotage and assassinations, and had laid mines, and because of the brutal response of Rwandan Patriotic Army (APR) forces (rounding up of people, abductions, summary executions, and even massacres).
The conflict between APR and the infiltrators had created a situation of insecurity along the borders with Zaire.
The problems of the return of the refugees jeopardized the new strategy of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, adopted on 11 October 1996 by the Executive Committee, aimed at bringing about accelerated repatriation (gradual closing of the camps, processing of individual requests for refugee status, strict application of the exclusion clause with regard to alleged perpetrators of genocide, their separation from other refugees and handing over to the International Tribunal).
The current military, political and humanitarian crises in Zaire had completely disrupted that entire strategy.
