In this connection, FAO will consider the following recommendations to design activities for 1996 and beyond:
(a) Statistical designs and analytical systems for series of transition matrices should be further developed:
(i) To use the auxiliary information such as the one on existing wall-to-wall forest classification based on AVHRR data (with 1 km resolution) from NOAA, as well as other statistical and spatial information databases (Forest Resources Information System, GIS layers);
(ii) To improve estimates for change by stratifying parameters that would reduce the variance of forest area changes such as demography, economic indicators and infrastructure;
(b) Sound monitoring procedures such as interdependent remote sensing analysis should be further promoted for their implementation to obtain location specific information in order to assist decision-making;
(c) The vegetation classifications which have been adopted at the country level in response to local needs should be maintained to the extent possible, compatible with global standards to allow full contribution to the global base.
With the Government of the Netherlands, FAO is preparing a new cooperative programme, Pilot Remote Sensing Processing and Archiving System for Forest Assessment and Monitoring RESPAS.
The project will produce geometrically corrected remote sensing data, optimized for forest applications, for national and subnational forest departments and the National Tropical Forests Action Programme units to establish and/or strengthen the capacity of developing countries to assess and monitor their forest resources.
It could be further developed to be integrated with GIS and other databases, such as the Forest Resources Information System, and with simulation and modelling capabilities to assist in the planning and definition of forestry policies.
The Tropical Forest Action Plan Coordination Unit and the Field Programme of FAO would be the main users.
This project has already started with a user needs assessment in order to meet user requirements at a national level for managing forest areas and a preliminary outline for the RESPAS system concept.
The countries that should be involved in this pilot project are Colombia, Guinea, Kenya and the Philippines.

Those missions will assist in (a) promoting space technology applications for sustainable development, with emphasis on policy issues and institutional building; and (b) strengthening national capabilities in space applications or development with special emphasis on remote sensing and related GIS applications.
FAO, through its AFRICOVER project, contributes to strengthening African capacities in advance geographic information technologies on environment and natural resources.
The value of the AFRICOVER project is not merely in the usefulness of the maps and databases to be produced; the elaboration of such maps will initiate efforts towards capacity building in the region of Africa through the development of national information systems on environment and natural resources, crop assessment and food security, land management and large watershed management, preparation of investment field projects and locust and desertification control (see paragraphs 97 and 98 above).
The main emphasis of the activities of FAO in the field of agricultural applications has been placed on the systematic enhancement of the national capacities of existing institutes whose mandate lies in implementing activities involving remote sensing, natural resource monitoring and mapping.
The current tendency is to implement projects whose operational capacity has been vital to larger programmes.
The following is a list of activities which will continue to be carried out in the period 1996-1997 for the above purposes:
(b) Egypt: Egypt has been the focal point for two other important institution-building projects assisted by FAO.
The first project is located at the Desert Research Centre, which now has the capacity to monitor the delicate ecological balance of Egyptian rangelands.
The Centre will also supply data to the Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel programme.
The second project is located at the Soil and Water Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture.
As a result of the significant strengthening of its remote sensing capacity, the Institute has expanded monitoring of renewable natural resources in Egypt.
Remote sensing is also used for operational soil mapping within the delta, and regular crop acreage estimates are made for the major crops each season.
The Institute has also attracted a considerable amount of additional resources on a bilateral basis from Canada and France to further enhance its mapping and agricultural statistics reporting capacity;
(c) Côte d'Ivoire: FAO is assisting in the establishment of a Remote Sensing Laboratory at the Institute for Tropical Geography, University of Abidjan.
FAO is also involved in the preparation of an environmental information system with UNDP;
(d) Afghanistan: A project for land-cover inventory on the scales 1:100,000 and 1:250,000, based on satellite remote sensing, is being implemented.
It will provide the basis for assessing the change in area cultivated or lost during the 13 years of war.
The historical perspective of land-use changes has been provided from existing maps and photographs which have been digitized and will be compared with the current situation.
All these documents will be used for land-use policy planning.
In order to improve availability of current information on vegetation cover and land use in Africa, FAO has formulated a project proposal for a Land Cover Map and Digital Database of Africa.
This proposal, which was endorsed by the United Nations Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities, is now being submitted by African countries to potential donors (see paragraphs 97 and 98 above).
FAO should retain the capability to play an active role in building the capacity of and strengthening national and regional bodies, especially in developing countries, through:
(a) Training for decision makers and project managers;
(b) Support to national and regional centres (consultancy for equipment, maintenance, organization, training courses for technical staff);
(c) Technology transfer from headquarters to countries and regions (early warning systems, projects, pilot action studies).
UNITAR contributes to national and regional capacity building for sustainable development through its various activities related to environmental management with the use of space technology, as well as new information and ground communication technologies.
Those activities include training programmes, pilot projects and dissemination of information.
The following four major UNITAR programmes particularly concern the development of new information and communication technologies and the transfer of those technologies to the developing countries: (a) the AFRICAGIS programme, which is carried out jointly with the Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel; (b) the space information systems programme on climate change; (c) the InterAfrique programme for the development of communication and information networks in Africa; and (d) the environmental modelling programme.
The joint AFRICAGIS programme has, through the following activities, established a working framework and paved the way for the establishment and operation of integrated information systems on the environment in Africa, both at the thematic level and at the institutional level:
(a) At the thematic level, the need to intensify methodological study has been identified, in order to have recognized standards, harmonized databases and efficient means of communications.
In this regard, the following activities will be carried out for the period 1996-1997:
(i) Establishment of an information system on desertification in Africa, in cooperation with the World Resources Institute and CNES of France.
In this context, the Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel and UNITAR are establishing an international group of experts on the standardization of geographic information in Africa;
(ii) Preparation of training material in 1996, within the framework of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa (A/49/84/Add.2, annex, appendix II), on new technologies to compile, manage and analyse information on desertification phenomena and organization of two or three regional training seminars on the Integrated Environmental Information System (IEIS);
(iii) Provision of a training programme, in connection with the introduction of national policies on geographic information, involving all the national parties, in order to build a standard national database.
The database would be duplicated in the various ministries and technical centres and would permit coordinated and rational planning at the State level as well as at the sectoral level within those bodies.
The purpose of such a programme will be to assist State services in establishing a national policy for numerical cartography, which is indispensable for the efficient management of natural resources.
Activities of the initial phase of the programme are ongoing or will be carried out with Côte d'Ivoire and the United Republic of Tanzania, in cooperation with UNEP, its GEMS programme and the Office to Combat Desertification and Drought, and with Ethiopia and Nigeria, in cooperation with the Office to Combat Desertification and Drought and the AGRHYMET programme.
(b) At the institutional level, a mechanism has been established for information exchange and coordination between technical centres and universities of the South and the North and bilateral and multilateral financing partners.
This mechanism consists of the following activities:
(i) Organization of biennial meetings of the pan-African conference on IEIS (AFRICAGIS '93, held at Tunis in 1993; AFRICAGIS '95, held at Abidjan in 1995; and AFRICAGIS '97, to be held at Gaborone in 1997);
(ii) AFRICAGIS@RIO.ORG, an electronic forum in which more than 500 members receive information bulletins on GIS and remote sensing on a regular basis and exchange various information;
(iii) Circulation of the AFRICAGIS News bulletin three times a year;
(iv) Maintenance of an inventory of GIS applications in Africa;
(v) Technological monitoring of GIS software.
Within the framework of the joint CC:TRAIN programme of UNITAR and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (A/AC.237/18 (Part II)/Add.1), a training programme on space information systems for climate change has started.
This programme is aimed at assisting States in building technical and institutional capacities to establish national mechanisms for the operation of space information systems.
Such mechanisms would involve decision makers who need data on climate change as a basis for making relevant policies. They would also involve the scientific and technical community, which has new information and communication technologies available for the compilation, management and analysis of data on climate change.
UNITAR will start the first two-year phase of the InterAfrique programme at the end of 1995 in cooperation with ORSTOM and the Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel.
The programme concerns decision makers, managers of research and development programmes and the African scientific and technical community and is aimed at increasing their awareness of the opportunities and challenges of information and communication networks.
The programme is also aimed at training them in the utilization of such networks.
In this regard, the programme will:
(a) Offer tools for communication between technical and institutional partners working on national and international programmes concerning the environment, as well as scientific and technical research;
(b) Promote access by those partners in Africa to the Internet forums in order to better integrate the African community into international research and development efforts through their direct involvement in multilateral programmes and projects;
(c) Reinforce the African capacity for electronic communication on subjects of sectoral interest (e.g. agriculture, forestry, water resources, meteorology and climatology) and of global interest (e.g. economics and environment);
(d) Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication, local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed, and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence.
The environmental modelling programme has developed a methodology that identifies ways and means of streamlining key organizations involved in national and regional development planning.
Through case-studies, this programme attempts to identify what policy could best reduce the negative impact of land degradation and subsequent damages on biological potential.
The programme proposes a series of generic means to understand structural changes in the way people earn their living, as well as various economic aspects of social life.
Such information is utilized to examine possible changes in land status and to produce graphic materials to be used by decision makers and scientists trained by UNITAR.
This programme is directed mainly at the Latin American and Caribbean region.
In addition to the above major programmes, UNITAR will continue to publish in the period 1996-1997 a series of training manuals on EIS.
The current series of UNITAR educational publications started in 1991 under the general title "Exploration in the Technology of Geographic Information Systems".
The series comprises manuals designed to assist those involved in natural resources and environment management in learning analytical techniques and the principal applications of GIS technology.
The manuals have been prepared to meet the needs of UNITAR trainees and provide descriptions, guidelines and scientific literature on various related issues, as well as exercises and case-studies for practical use with specially prepared software and diskettes accompanying each volume.
This series of UNITAR manuals has been developed in cooperation with recognized scientists and academic and government institutions throughout the world.
Each volume is subject to practical tests before publication and distribution.
Five volumes have been published since 1991 under the titles Change and Time Series Analysis, GIS Application in Forestry, GIS Application in Coastal Zone Management, GIS and Decision-Making and GIS Applications in Mountain EnvironmentsOfficial Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Supplement No. 14 (A/49/14, para. 188).
. Other volumes, entitled "GIS applications in hazards and risk assessment" and "GIS application in urban areas in developing countries", are currently under preparation.
The publications will appear for the first time in French under the general title "Techniques et acquisitions des données et du traitement de l'information géographique".
Other manuals are also being prepared.
B. Communications and navigation
ICAO conducts activities to face new challenges concerning human resources involved in the introduction of advanced satellite-based communications, navigation and surveillance and air traffic management (CNS/ATM).
In order to ensure that the system design and operating procedures take into account human performance and limitation, ICAO published a circular entitled "Human factors in CNS/ATM systems" (Circ. 249), which defines a philosophy of human-centred automation and provides the user with a practical template against which the human factors issues can be measured during acquisition and implementation of CNS/ATM-related technology.
ICAO also recognizes that an adequate number of people should be trained or retrained in the use of new technologies.
In this connection, ICAO addresses human resource planning and training issues through its TRAINAIR programme, which provides a mechanism for cooperation among training centres for the development of the many new training courses which are required.
The ITU Radiocommunication Bureau will be organizing seminars every two years and regional seminars in the intervening years on frequency management and the use of the geostationary-satellite orbit, with a view to providing technical assistance to the participating countries.
ITU will organize the World Telecommunication Policy Forum to discuss and exchange views and information on broad telecommunication policy issues, technological advances, infrastructure development and financial business considerations.
The first meeting of the new Forum will take place from 21 to 23 October 1996 and will consider Global Mobile Personal Communication systems.
Through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, ESA provides fellowship support for candidates from developing countries for in-depth training in the area of antenna propagation and satellite communications systems.
2. Expert services and survey missions to identify specific areas of applications
specific studies on pilot projects or to implement the projects with operational applications of technology
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will continue to provide support to the Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council, which was established as a conference in October 1994 and became a council in 1995.
The Council will serve as a regional forum for promoting exchanges of information and cooperation in the field of satellite communications and broadcasting.
UNESCO, as a member of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee, is acting in an advisory capacity and is providing assistance to the RASCOM project.
Activities of ITU in the area of satellite communications include the following:
(a) The ITU Telecommunications Development Bureau (BDT) will continue to provide, at the request of administrations of member States that are developing countries, experts to participate in satellite Earth station projects and in the planning of regional or domestic satellite communication systems.
Documents prepared by BDT, such as telecommunication development plans, master plans or sectoral studies, usually include a satellite communications component;
(b) Administrations of member States will continue to be kept regularly informed, through the Radiocommunication Bureau weekly circular and the special sections annexed thereto, of frequency assignments and orbital positions communicated to the Bureau in space radiocommunication services.
The Bureau also responds to requests for advice from administrations on specific topics and provides information and documents, mainly in relation to space radiocommunication services.
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will continue to make its efforts towards the implementation of the Cooperative Information Network Linking Scientists, Educators and Professionals in Africa (COPINE) project, which focuses on the implementation of a satellite-based information system.
COPINE is aimed at improving the collection, transmission, distribution and exchange of information particularly in such areas as health care, agricultural research and development, management of natural resources and the environment, education and science and technology through, for example, computer file transfer, interactive data transfer, document transmission and imagery and video transmission, to facilitate video conferences, distant teaching and telemedicine.
The Governing Council of UNEP at its eighteenth session approved the implementation of the satellite-based telecommunications system known as Mercure.
This system consists of a suite of 16 International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) Earth stations in a dual configuration of eight high-capacity stations (with video conference capability) and eight lower-capacity stations for limited service in less developed telecommunications locations.
The Mercure project is now under implementation, and the eight high-capacity stations, which will function as the backbone of the system, are currently under construction.
The locations of the stations are as follows: Geneva (Geneva Executive Centre, UNEP Regional Office for Europe), Nairobi (UNEP headquarters), Mexico City (UNEP Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean), Bangkok (UNEP Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific), Moscow (Federal Centre of Geoecological Systems, Ministry of the Environment of the Russian Federation) and Beijing (National Environmental Protection Agency, Ministry of the Environment of China).
The installation and preparation were initiated in the third quarter of 1995; the installations are expected to be completed as of the fourth quarter of 1996.
In the deployment of the satellite communication earth stations, UNEP works closely with its regional bodies to ensure that, in accordance with its policy to extend its service to the regions, the system will be utilized in the best possible way.
UNEP will continue to operate the Direct Information Access Network for Africa (DIANA) data communications system between FAO at Rome and RCSSMRS at Nairobi, the Department of Meteorology at Harare and the FAO Regional Office for Africa at Accra.
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome.
Negotiations are in progress to identify a funding source to ensure the continued operation of the system beyond 1995.
The DIANA system will possibly be upgraded and integrated with the Mercure network after the latter is implemented.
ESCAP will implement a project on the study of satellite communication applications for distant education in Asia and the Pacific.
In this connection, an expert group meeting will be organized to identify issues and prioritize areas for regional cooperation in 1996.
A pilot project on distant education using communication satellite technology will be developed for implementation in a select group of ESCAP member States through this study.
FAO, in cooperation with ESA, in 1992 started testing the DIANA satellite communication system, developed under ESA management.
The system is at present at the demonstration stage.
Although its cost cannot be justified by the FAO remote sensing telecommunications requirements alone, it may develop into a multi-purpose, multi-user satellite telecommunications system in future.
Such a development would significantly strengthen communication links between Africa and Europe.
UNESCO is continuing to examine different ways and means of making wider use of low and geostationary-orbit satellite systems for communication, information, informatics, education, science, culture and environmental protection in the implementation of programmes and projects such as the following:
(a) Within the framework of the recovery plan of the Pan-African News Agency, a satellite communication network for the exchange of information will be established by linking most of the national agencies in Africa.
These activities are conducted in close cooperation with United Nations specialized agencies, national and regional space institutions and non-governmental organizations, as well as interested member States;
(b) Within the framework of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century (Delors Commission), UNESCO will continue to assess, evaluate and study the experience achieved in distance education, as well as the impact of new communication and information technologies, in particular, communication satellites applicable to distance education.
Within the framework of the UNESCO initiative "Learning without Frontiers", which fosters lifelong education for all at all levels, a joint ITU/UNESCO pilot project on education application of interactive television will be implemented.
The project, which supports the teaching of primary teachers in developing countries, consists of upgrading ordinary television sets to enable the viewer to communicate by voice and data channel with the broadcast site.
UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content, while ITU, which is developing the standards, will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation.
ITU will continue to contribute in this sphere through the following activities:
(a) In the light of technological development, ITU radiocommunication study groups 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11 will pursue studies on technology and spectrum/orbit utilization for space communications.
The radiocommunication study groups are part of the ITU Radiocommunication Sector, which is responsible for studying technical, operational and regulatory/procedural questions on radiocommunication, issuing recommendations and preparing the technical basis for radiocommunication assemblies and world radiocommunication conferences;
(b) The Telecommunication Standardization Bureau of ITU will continue its work on a study programme concerning the application of space technology in different services, including aeronautical mobile, maritime mobile and land mobile services, telecommunication services to remote regions and weather forecasts.
The Bureau will also continue its work on the integration of satellite systems into the general telecommunication network.
Many study groups of the Telecommunication Standardization Sector and the Radiocommunication Sector of ITU contribute to this work by developing recommendations and drawing up specifications.
The sectors also prepare recommendations in order to ensure continuing and full integration of the satellite transmission medium in public digital networks, including the integrated services digital network, taking into account emerging technologies, applications and services;
(c) Following the decisions of the World Telecommunication Standardization Conference, held at Helsinki in 1993, an intersectoral coordination group has been established between the Telecommunication Standardization Sector and the Radiocommunication Sector of ITU with a view to coordinating the direction of studies on future public land mobile telecommunication systems in particular relating to their satellite component.
A draft recommendation on network functions for those systems, to serve as basis for developing the signalling interfaces to support their services, is being finalized;
(d) The above intersectoral coordination group will also coordinate the review of recommendations on satellite matters prepared in both sectors;
(e) BDT continues its work to implement the Buenos Aires Action Plan for the Global Development of Telecommunications, which was adopted by the first World Telecommunication Development Conference, held at Buenos Aires in March 1994.
The implementation of the Action Plan will enable the agreed goals and objectives to be reflected in a concrete work programme for the period 1994-1998 and will make telecommunications a principal factor contributing to sustainable development.
The Action Plan comprises the following three parts: a programme of cooperation among the members of the Telecommunication Development Sector of ITU; a BDT plan of action for assisting developing countries; and a special programme for the least developed countries.
The second part of the Action Plan consists of 12 programmes, including programmes on policies, strategies and financing; human resource management and development; frequency management; integrated rural development; and broadcasting infrastructure.
Satellite communications are an integral part of those programmes.
The Action Plan mainly refers to coordinated regional and global activities.
It is expected that those activities will be complimented by multilateral and bilateral projects executed or supported by ITU and its development partners;
(f) Within the scope of the Buenos Aires Action Plan, which listed as a priority item the need to increase the accessibility of telecommunication services in rural and remote areas in developing countries, ITU launched in 1994 an interregional project called Space Communications Technology Applications (SPACECOM) for developing countries.
The project was designed by BDT, in association with industry.
The project seeks to promote the broad applications of space communications technology in developing countries, which would greatly contribute to the development of the countries concerned and the satellite communication industry by forging a strong partnership between the space communications industry and the telecommunication operator and user community in developing countries.
Although the involvement of ITU in the RASCOM project formally terminated in December 1993, ITU is following its activities and coordinating with the Pan-African Telecommunications Network (PANAFTEL), since the two systems (satellite and terrestrial) are complementary (A/AC.105/551, paras. 151 and 152).
In particular, rural and remote areas will have to be linked to the networks through either of the above systems.
WIPO will continue to study various questions related to the use of broadcasting satellites in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights in the context of the committee of experts on a possible protocol to the Berne Convention.
Those questions include the digital broadcasting, the encryption of broadcast signals, the technical security means, and the ownership of rights between the country of emission of the signal and the country or countries of reception ("footprint" countries).
3. Dissemination or exchange of information on the status of technology or
operational systems through meetings or publications
UNEP is promoting modern telecommunication methods, including satellite-based telecommunications for the exchange of electronic messages and dissemination of environmental information.
Mercure will be the hub of these initiatives beginning in 1996, but in the interim, a network of computer bulletin board systems links UNEP regional offices with its headquarters at Nairobi.
Additionally, the International Environment System Information (INFOTERRA) has published a subscription list for environmental queries and opened a fully fledged Gopher node on the Internet.
The UNEP International Cleaner Production Information Clearing-house, one of the activities under the Cleaner Production Programme, continues to provide an on-line computerized information exchange service to promote the concept of cleaner production on a global scale.
Other Cleaner Production Programme activities include: training and technical assistance, in which UNEP Industry and Energy assists Governments, industry and academia in the preparation and presentation of workshops and seminars at their request; publications, which help the dissemination of information and exchange of experiences; and organization of working groups, which collect and disseminate information and provide input to the direction of the Programme.
(a) Its Radiocommunication Bureau periodically publishes approved recommendations, either new or revised, on space radiocommunications.
Publications of special interest for space radiocommunications concern issues on space applications; fixed service using communications satellites; mobile-satellite, radiodetermination-satellite, amateur-satellite and broadcasting-satellite (sound and television) services; satellite news gathering; frequency sharing; and compatibility of different services.
They form the basis for harmonious technical development of space radiocommunication systems and contain criteria for the sharing of frequency bands between the various space services, as well as between space and terrestrial systems;
(b) The third edition of the ITU Handbook on Satellite Communications (Fixed-Satellite Service) and the Handbook on the Mobile-Satellite Service are under preparation;
(c) ITU publishes in its Newsletter at regular intervals (10 times a year) a list of launched satellites, together with their technical characteristics and orbital parameters.
Once a year, a complete table of launched satellites is published;
(d) ITU also publishes annually the Report on Telecommunication and the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, covering the activities carried out in this field by both the ITU secretariat and the administrations of member States;
(e) ITU organizes the quadrennial World Telecommunication Exhibition and Forum (TELECOM), as well as similar regional events in Africa, the Americas and Asia.
Preparations are now under way for Americas TELECOM-96, which will be held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 10 to 15 June 1996.
The Forum will comprise a Strategy and Technology Summit, and the main theme will be "Telecommunications and Sustainable Development - From Potential to Growth";
(f) The Radiocommunication Bureau publishes quarterly an updated list of orbital positions and associated frequency bands for space stations on board geostationary satellite and non-geostationary space systems.
In a more detailed form, it publishes all the technical characteristics of satellite networks submitted to it under the coordination or notification procedures, for recording in the Master International Frequency Register.
4. Regulation of the use of the geostationary satellite orbit and the radio-frequency
spectrum allocated to space communication services
The 1995 World Radiocommunication Conference, which took place at Geneva from 23 October to 17 November 1995, adopted the following:
(a) Regulatory and technical procedures to facilitate the use of frequency bands below 3 GHz allocated to the mobile satellite service as follow-up to decisions of the World Administrative Radio Conference held in 1992;
(b) Additional frequency allocations to the mobile satellite service;
(c) Simplified Radio Regulations;
(d) Preliminary agenda for the 1997 World Radio Conference, the main task of which will be to review the plan for the Broadcasting Satellite Service and the plan for feeder links in regions 1 and 2.
The preparatory meeting for the 1997 Conference, which has been established to carry out the necessary preparatory work for the Conference, will continue its task.
The ITU Radiocommunication Sector study groups are conducting studies in the field of space radiocommunications concerning technical aspects of mobile-satellite, fixed-satellite, Earth-exploration satellite, meteorological satellite, space research, space operation and broadcasting-satellite services and low-orbit satellite systems.
The report to the 1997 Conference will be prepared by the preparatory meeting in order to assist the ITU members who will be involved in the deliberations of the Conference.
Technological progress, politico-social structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services, the introduction of non-geostationary satellite systems for commercial communications and other elements prompted the plenipotentiary conference of ITU, held at Kyoto, Japan, in 1994, to call for, in its resolution 18, a new in-depth review of the ITU spectrum/orbit resource allocation procedures.
The review is being undertaken by the Radiocommunication Bureau of ITU.
A preliminary report was submitted to the 1995 World Radiocommunication Conference.
A final report summarizing the results of studies by different organs of ITU will be presented to the 1997 Conference with a view to deciding on ways of incorporating new procedures and mechanisms into the ITU legal regime in order to increase efficiency and equity in spectrum/orbit utilization.
5. Studies on and/or preparations for the establishment of new legal frameworks or the
development of new systems to complement the existing legal frameworks
United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 144, No. 17949. UNESCO will continue its activities which encourage further ratification or acceptance of the Convention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite, adopted at Brussels in 1974.
Where relevant, the copyright and neighbouring rights problems raised by the use of different types of satellites for broadcasting purposes shall be dealt with within the framework of UNESCO studies on the impact of electronic technology, in particular digital, on the creation and dissemination of protected materials
Two symposia on telematics for development, similar to the one organized in Ethiopia in April 1995 in cooperation with ECA, ITU and the International Development Research Centre, are to be held in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in the Arab States.
The aim of the above-mentioned activities is to strengthen the relationship among service providers, telecommunications operators and end users in sectors of public concern in order to improve access to telematics facilities.
ICAO is continuing its action towards the implementation of CNS/ATM systems, which are largely based on satellite technology.
The CNS/ATM Implementation Committee, created on 27 February 1995, reports directly to the ICAO Council.
In 1996 and beyond, it will, inter alia, review progress on the implementation of the CNS/ATM global plan, as well as the CNS/ATM implementation plans of States, international organizations, airlines and industry, and make proposals to the ICAO Council with a view to facilitating the worldwide implementation of CNS/ATM.
ICAO has given its Legal Committee the task of considering with regard to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) the establishment of a legal framework.
In accordance with the agreement of the ICAO Council, the Legal Committee will consider in 1996 and beyond specific issues, including: (a) definition of internationally acceptable institutional arrangements; (b) possible role of ICAO in the long-term provision of GNSS; (c) content of the arrangements to be entered into between ICAO and the States providing the present GNSS; and (d) compliance of GNSS providers with the relevant ICAO standards and recommended practices (see paragraphs 186-190 below).
WIPO will continue to study the changes brought about by new and emerging technologies, notably by digital technology, on copyright and neighbouring rights.
Following worldwide symposia in 1993 and 1994 on related issues (A/AC.105/587, para. 199), WIPO organized a World Symposium on Copyright in the Global Information Infrastructure at Mexico City from 22 to 24 May 1995.
A World Forum on the Protection of Intellectual Creations in the Information Society took place at Naples, Italy, from 18 to 20 October 1995.
Such activities should continue in 1996 and 1997.
WIPO is also proposing new international norms in the fields of industrial property, copyright and neighbouring rights.
WIPO has recently set up an arbitration system for disputes between private parties and is finalizing work on a treaty on the settlement of intellectual property disputes between States, which could be ready in 1996.
The question of the enforcement of intellectual property rights in outer space could perhaps be discussed in those contexts.
6. Land, maritime and aeronautical mobile satellite services
IMO has undertaken studies on a worldwide radio-navigation system and has adopted a policy for recognition and acceptance of such systems (IMO resolution A.666(16)).
GPS and GLONASS, which are candidate systems, are expected to be available for consideration and acceptance in the period 1995-1996.
When either of these two or any other such system becomes operational, amendments to the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea will be considered, taking into account the above-mentioned policy.
As the operational availability of GPS has been guaranteed by the United States only until 2005 and GLONASS by the Russian Federation until 2010, IMO is considering the need and seeking the means to develop plans for a post-GPS/GLONASS system, internationally controlled civil GNSS in cooperation with ICAO and other user organizations.
At the ICAO Special Communications/Operations Divisional Meeting held in 1995, the Government of the United States reiterated its offer of the GPS standard positioning service for use by the international aviation community.
It is the intention of the United States that such a service be a complementary component of the future GNSS, as envisaged by ICAO.
The Government of the Russian Federation confirmed a similar offer for GLONASS, consisting of 24 operational navigation satellites.
To allow States and operators to realize early the benefits of these existing satellite-based navigation systems, ICAO has developed and circulated to States and selected international organizations a draft version of a document entitled "Guidelines for the introduction of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)", which will be finalized in 1996.
Ibid., vol. 740, No. 10612. At the above-mentioned meeting, ICAO contracting States recommended a global strategy for the implementation of all weather non-visual approach and landing operations for the next 20 years.
The strategy includes considerations on the validations of the use of GNSS, with such augmentations as required, to support approach and departure operations, including category I operations.
States are encouraged to implement GNSS for such operations as appropriate and to complete feasibility studies for category I and II operations, based on GNSS technology.
With respect to space-based aeronautical communications, in 1995 ICAO adopted and included in annex 10 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, detailed technical standards for communications in the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service.
ICAO and IMO have initiated cooperation for the multi-modal use of GNSS in order to ensure that the service provided by the system will meet the needs of maritime users as well as the aviation community.
C. Meteorology and hydrology UNESCO will continue to support the following postgraduate training programmes:
(a) The Training and Education in Marine Science programme released in 1995 its fifth computer-based learning module, on applications of marine and coastal image data from satellite, airborne and in situ sensors, concluding the first phase of a project which started 10 years ago.
The first module with lessons in the Windows version of the BILKO image-processing software is scheduled for early 1996.
Future modules will focus on coastal regions and, in particular, on small islands;
(b) IOC will continue to organize, in 1996 and beyond, regional training courses on the applications of remote sensing data to marine studies using the above-mentioned computer-based learning modules;
(c) UNESCO, in cooperation with ITC, will continue to organize in 1996 training courses on the use of remote sensing images and GIS in water research studies, within the framework of the International Hydrological Programme.
ESCAP is organizing the first meeting of a regional working group on meteorology satellite applications and disaster monitoring.
The working group will establish its terms of reference and develop a self-sustainable regional cooperation mechanism for promoting broader uses of meteorology satellite data for sustainable development in the region of Asia and the Pacific.
FAO, in cooperation with ESA, will organize in Latin America in 1996 a workshop for decision makers on watershed management.
WMO plans to continue to collaborate with the United Nations, other organizations and WMO members in the co-sponsorship of training events during the period 1996-1997.
The WMO proposals for satellite-related events for the biennium 1996-1997 include the seventh training course on tropical meteorology and tropical cyclone forecasting, to be held in 1996; the second southern hemisphere training course on tropical cyclones, to be held in 1996; and the fourth Regional Association workshop on hurricane forecasting and warning, to be held in 1997.
Through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, ESA is providing fellowship support for the in-depth training of participants from developing countries in the area of satellite meteorology.
IOC provides grants annually, through the Training, Education and Mutual Assistance Programme, for short-term training which enables scientists from developing countries to participate in marine-related remote sensing training.
WMO grants fellowships under its Voluntary Cooperation Programme and its regular budget, as well as through UNDP and trust funds, for studies or training in meteorology and operational hydrology, including studies and training in satellite meteorology, interpretation of meteorological satellite photographs, satellite transmission systems and nephanalysis.
In addition to fellows being trained at the WMO regional meteorological training centres, WMO members also provide training in numerical weather prediction products and interpretation of meteorological satellite data through fellowships offered by them under the Voluntary Cooperation Programme.
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will continue to provide technical advisory services to the Organisation for Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Co-operation (IOMAC) in the use of remote sensing for monitoring and management of coastal resources, including the preparation of a project proposal for submission to the Global Environment Facility.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Arendal, is assisting the International Northern Sea Route Programme in 1996 with a coastal environmental information system which permits scientists and decision makers to evaluate both operational and accidental transit impact on the coastal environment.
The Programme has established over 50 research projects to evaluate the effects of increased commercial navigation through the Arctic north-east passage.
The Programme links key institutions in Japan, Norway and the Russian Federation to sponsor research projects aimed at developing a knowledge base to help decision makers to evaluate the usability of the remote trade route.
The GRID facility at Arendal is assisting the Programme in developing the coastal environmental information modelling system.
UNEP, through its GRID facility at Arendal, will continue to develop and refine a GIS database of the Baltic Sea catchment area.
There is increasing awareness that the focus of the management of that hydroecological region needs to be shifted from the sea itself to the surrounding land areas if the aim is to improve the environmental status of the Baltic Sea.
The main purpose of the project is to facilitate the management and analysis of the environment in the Baltic Sea drainage area by providing coherent spatial information related to environmental issues.
To that end, a limited number of basic GIS data sets will be created and made available to interested users.
The main geographical area to be covered by the project is the Baltic Sea drainage basin, although some data layers will extend beyond that area.
Some cartographic data of the Baltic Sea itself have also been identified as desirable.
The distribution policy for the data sets has yet to be determined in detail.
However, the underlying idea is that all institutions and bodies involved in environmental issues of the region should have practically unlimited access to those data sets (in public domain).
A considerable amount of the maps and data sets are available through the World Wide Web homepage of the GRID facility at Arendal.
UNEP and WMO will continue their work with the African Centre of Meteorological Applications for Development.
FAO is assisting in developing a Nile forecasting centre within the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources at Cairo to monitor and forecast the flows of the Nile and its tributaries.
The project, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is designed to assist Egyptian planners in the more effective regulation of the Nile waters stored in Lake Nasser, with an integral part involving the real-time receipt and processing of environmental satellite data for precipitation estimation.
The project is being carried out with the National Weather Service of NOAA of the United States as a subcontractor for the development of hydrological models.
The FAO Fisheries Department plans to install a satellite ground receiving station for NOAA-AVHRR local area coverage image data.
The station will be used for satellite limnology, in support of the FAO/FINNIDA project entitled "Research for the management of fisheries on Lake Tanganyika".
UNEP will continue to participate in developing and supporting the programmes of GCOS secretariat in 1996 and beyond.
UNEP is cooperating with FAO, UNESCO, WMO and ICSU in supporting the planning process for GTOS.
GTOS is envisaged as one of a number of global observing systems which will be complementary to each other and mutually supportive.
It will provide the observational framework and data basis for (a) detection and understanding of the impact of regional and global changes on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; (b) evaluation of the impact and consequences of global changes on terrestrial ecosystems components and the environment; (c) forecasting, prediction and early warning of future terrestrial changes and their impact; and (d) validation of global models of ecosystem processes and changes.
An initial scientific proposal for GTOS is expected to be ready in 1996.
The space observation component of GTOS will be addressed within that proposal.
UNEP is continuing its close cooperation with GOOS.
UNEP, through its Ocean and Coastal Areas Programme Activity Centre and its GRID facility at Nairobi, and with funding from the Government of Belgium, will continue to implement a programme to develop a marine and coastal zone database and atlas for eastern African countries in 1996 and beyond.
The work is largely based on classifications derived from LANDSAT thematic mapper images.
FAO, within the framework of the ARTEMIS phase III project, will continue a major satellite rainfall estimation calibration programme, in cooperation with the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, and regional FAO projects in the IGADD and SADC regions.
Under this programme, the ground-measured rainfall data from approximately 1,000 meteorological stations in Africa are systematically correlated with cold cloud duration data derived from the ARTEMIS hourly Meteosat observations.
Meteosat-based quantitative rainfall estimates are obtained by linear regression.
Their accuracy is expected to increase with extended duration of the calibration programme.
The Fishery Department of FAO conducts remote sensing activities for fisheries.
Satellite remote sensing, in particular when combined with GIS, is increasingly being used in marine and inland fishery projects.
FAO is developing GIS for the world ocean fisheries, resources and environment in 1996 and 1997.
Pilot projects on the use of AVHRR data for inland fisheries are in progress.
UNESCO will continue its cooperation with FAO, the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme of ICSU, UNEP and WMO in the development of GTOS, which will cover the broad question of monitoring biodiversity.
Two activities within the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere programme are of special relevance: the International Network of Biosphere Reserves and the Diversitas Programme.
UNESCO and FAO will implement a joint programme to develop a GIS-based tool for the assessment of water resources on a continental scale.
IOC, in cooperation with the UNEP GRID facilities at Arendal and Nairobi, will continue to develop marine data information systems.
ITU Radiocommunication Study Group 7 will continue to study questions relating to the meteorological-satellite service and associated technologies throughout the next study period.
The application of satellite technology in meteorology and operational hydrology forms an important element of the technical cooperation activities of WMO.
Those activities are generally undertaken with assistance from either the voluntary cooperation programmes of WMO or UNDP.
The following activities are planned for 1996 and future years:
(a) Africa: A number of WMO members, including France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and United States, are donating data collection platforms to countries in Africa for the collection of meteorological data via the geostationary meteorological satellite Meteosat as well as Meteorological Data Distribution reception stations to improve the availability of observational data and processed information at national meteorological centres.
Furthermore, eight satellite stations of the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) are to be installed in the countries that are members of CILSS with funding from USAID, in order to enhance data and products flow between the AGRHYMET regional centre at Niamey and national AGRHYMET centres.
Some key stations in the Zambezi river basin will be equipped with data collection platforms using the Meteosat system for collecting data.
A multi-donor project is now under preparation to monitor desert locusts in Africa.
Under the project, 50 automatic stations will be installed.
In the Niger river basin, 64 data collection platforms using the Argos system have been operational for a number of years, and plans are being made to install more recent equipment.
In collaboration with the World Bank, WMO has drawn up plans to set up in Africa an advanced hydrological and environmental monitoring system using Meteosat.
About 100 stations will be installed on major rivers, costing between US$ 10 million and US$ 20 million over a period of five years;
(b) Americas: A plan for a new regional meteorological telecommunication network based on two-way multipoint telecommunication services via satellite was agreed upon and was to be operational in the second half of 1995, involving more than 20 countries.
The plan is being implemented as part of a FINNIDA project for the Central American countries and through other international cooperation funding, mainly from the United States, for the Caribbean countries.
The implementation of this plan will dramatically improve the meteorological telecommunication system in the region, including support for the Tropical Cyclone Programme;
(c) Europe and newly independent States: Some European countries such as Albania, Romania and Turkey have expressed a desire to establish and/or upgrade meteorological satellite receiving systems.
The newly independent States and other new WMO members are planning to acquire satellite receiving stations to actively monitor the meteorological conditions.
A plan for a new regional meteorological telecommunication network in Europe based on telecommunication services via satellite has been agreed upon and is being developed with a view to its implementation in the period 1996-1997.
Installation of small satellite Earth stations in meteorological services will be pursued and strengthened, in particular for newly independent States, for the reception of meteorological information distributed by RETIM of France and FAX-E of Germany within the framework of regional meteorological telecommunications.
Within the framework of the WMO plan of action for the International Decade for National Disaster Reduction, a special project to upgrade the tropical cyclone warning system for the south-west Indian Ocean subregion has been established with financial assistance from the European Development Fund.
The project is based on the application of meteorological satellite and microcomputer technology and on the transfer of scientific knowledge.
The project will be continued in the period 1996-1997.
The overall long-term goals of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), jointly sponsored by WMO, ICSU and IOC, are to determine to what extent climate can be predicted and the extent of human influence on climate.
Progress in this scientific programme on the successful continuation or new development of main space observing systems is described below:
(a) The scientific plan for WCRP gives high priority to understanding the effects of cloudiness on the radiation and energy budget.
The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project is producing long-term climatological records of global cloud amount and properties, as well as radiation flux data from the international array of geostationary meteorological satellites and operational polar-orbiting satellites.
The project has been extended to 2000;
(b) Several major observational programmes are pursued by WCRP: the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) and the Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS).
The new Topex/Poiseidon satellite for ocean surface topography, jointly developed and operated by NASA and CNES, and the ESA satellites ERS-1 and, as of 2 April 1995, ERS-2 are of particular importance for WOCE and ACSYS;
(c) Within GEWEX, WCRP produces global monthly fields of precipitation based on a combination of ground-based measurements and remote-sensing data from multiple satellite sources;
(d) Within GEWEX, WCRP has stimulated studies on a rain and cloud radar satellite mission in order to get divergences of energy fluxes in the atmosphere.
WMO continues to cooperate closely with UNEP, IOC and ICSU in the development of GOOS and to provide support for GOOS planning and implementation.
Climate system monitoring activities within the World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme make use of satellite data for monitoring such parameters as sea level, atmospheric temperature, sea ice, snow cover, solar radiation, aerosol optical depth, albedo and clouds.
The WMO World Climate Data Information Referral System (INFOCLIMA) includes information on some available satellite data sets needed for climate monitoring and research.
A Climate Change Detection Project has been established under the World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme to advise on the suitability of data, including satellite data, for detecting climate change.
The World Climate Applications and Services Programme continues to investigate and promote development of potential uses of satellite data in climate applications.
WMO continues to provide valuable data on atmospheric status through GAW, which it established in 1989 as an early warning system to detect changes in the greenhouse gases, including ozone, aerosols and other trace substances in the atmosphere that may lead to global climate change.
GAW consists of surface and vertical observations to provide the information required to verify future satellite-based measurements of selected atmospheric constituents.
In particular, GAW, through its more than 150 total ozone stations, has furnished critical ground truth data to calibrate ozone observations from space.
The WMO Commission for Atmospheric Sciences continues to rely on the use of satellite data for research, for both climate studies and weather analysis and prediction of all time scales.
The WMO Programme on Short- and Medium-range Weather Prediction Research and Tropical Meteorological Research will study the application of high-resolution quantitative satellite data.
Major WMO global data-processing centres operated by WMO members and equipped with supercomputers and high end mainframe computing facilities rely on remotely sensed data from meteorological satellites for operational input data.
This is particularly the case for data acquired over ocean areas and land areas.
Data acquired by meteorological satellites are used in global atmospheric and ocean models for numerical weather prediction and environmental quality assessment, as well as climate monitoring and medium-range, long-range, seasonal and multi-seasonal climate prediction.
Based on the structure of the WMO Hydrology and Water Resources Programme, a number of projects relating to hydrological networks and instrumentation, hydrological forecasting methods and systems and the application of remote sensing techniques to operational hydrology are undertaken on a continuing basis.
The programme is revised every four years by the WMO Commission for Hydrology.
The results of the projects formulated by the Commission at its tenth session in 1993 will be available in 1996.
A project on the intercomparison of data telemetry and transmission systems is currently being planned for implementation during 1996.
WMO and the World Bank are promoting a major long-term initiative to improve knowledge of the hydrological cycle through a World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS).
WHYCOS would consist initially of about 1,000 stations worldwide on major rivers.
Each station would monitor about 15 variables such as flow, suspended load, water chemistry and on-bank meteorological variables.
Many of the stations already exist, mostly in developed countries.
The data collected would be transmitted via geostationary satellites to national, regional and global centres, employing, among others, the WMO World Weather Watch system where applicable.
In turn, WHYCOS would contribute data to the World Weather Watch system, GCOS and GTOS.
The concept is currently being developed for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, for countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and for the Aral Sea basin.
WMO continues to make joint efforts with IOC, UNEP and ICSU in implementing various programmes in 1996, 1997 and future years under GCOS, which was established by those organizations to conduct observations that would meet scientific requirements for monitoring the climate and predicting climate changes.
The Joint Scientific and Technical Committee and the Joint Planning Office were also established to develop the plans and strategy for the implementation of GCOS.
The programmes of GCOS will be implemented in accordance with the initial plan developed by the Joint Scientific and Technical Committee, which outlined the scientific priorities for the programme and proposed a strategy for proceeding, including defining the components of an initial operational system.
A space component is considered a key element of the initial operational system.
The Joint Scientific and Technical Committee formed a Space-based Observation Panel, which developed and issued in June 1995 a GCOS Space Plan, the initial plan for the space-based observation component.
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following: (a) defining the components of the initial operational system, based on the existing systems of various space agencies; (b) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global, atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation; and (c) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements, including assured continuity of the observations.
Copies of the initial plan for GCOS are available from the Joint Planning Office of GCOS at Geneva or via Internet at the GCOS homepage (htpp://www.wmo.ch/web/gcoshome/html).
The Joint Scientific and Technical Committee also issued the Data and Information Management Plan, which outlines strategies for an international data distribution system to be implemented in the period 1996-1998.
UNEP is currently involved in the following collaborative undertakings:
(a) Coastal and Marine Environment Management Information System (COMEMIS) for the South China Sea subregion, covering Cambodia, southern China and Viet Nam, a project with the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Sweden;
(b) Information management in the North-West Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP): directory of coastal and marine experts and institutions; bibliography on coastal and marine environments in the region; and feasibility report on GIS applications in coastal marine environment for NOWPAP.
In collaboration with ITC, UNESCO has published a book entitled Introduction to the Use of GIS for Practical Hydrology, which will be distributed in 1996 free of charge.
UNESCO, within the framework of the International Hydrological Programme and in collaboration with the International Association of Hydrological Sciences, will organize the second international conference on GIS entitled "Application of Hydrology and Water Resources Management" in 1996 at Vienna.
WMO issues a biennial report on the status of implementation of the World Weather Watch. The report includes a section on the space-based portion of the Global Observing System, consisting of a network of geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites.
The next report will be published in mid-1997.
The status of satellite technology for application in meteorological observations and telecommunications is considered at each session of the WMO Commission for Basic Systems, which meets on a biennial basis. The next session of the Commission will take place during the second half of 1996.
WMO, in cooperation with IOC, continues to make considerable efforts to develop shipboard facilities which will enable ships at sea to receive meteorological and oceanographic data from Inmarsat and will disseminate warnings and forecasts.
The WMO Commission for Marine Meteorology, the joint IOC/WMO Committee for Integrated Global Ocean Services System and the IOC Committee for the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange maintain a high level of interest in the use of satellites for both ocean observation and marine communications.
A group of experts from the above-mentioned bodies has prepared a consolidated report on polar-orbiting oceanographic satellites and will expand this report in 1996 and beyond to cover geostationary satellites, the management of ocean satellite data and other ocean remote sensing issues.
A working group of the WMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology is presently responsible for reviewing and summarizing the development of techniques and methods to obtain and manage ground-based and remotely sensed agrometeorological and agronomic data in the most timely and efficient manner for application to agriculture.
A working group of the Commission prepared a report concerning processing and analysis of remote sensing data, as well as the application of those data to agriculture. The report is being reviewed for publication.
The WMO Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology is actively involved in the development and implementation of the ICAO World Area Forecast System (WAFS), which uses satellite-based communication systems to distribute information on aeronautical meteorological forecast in support of aviation.
The United States transmits WAFS products to two International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) satellites and the United Kingdom transmits WAFS products to cover Africa, Europe and West Asia. D. Basic space science
The sixth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science for Developing Countries will be organized in Germany in September 1996.
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will continue to provide assistance to the astronomical observatory in Sri Lanka, which was established in January 1996.
A telescope has been donated to the observatory by the Government of Japan as a result of the recommendations made by the United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science for Developing Countries, held at Bangalore, India, from 30 April to 3 May 1991 (A/AC.105/489).
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications will publish selected manuscripts on basic space science from the activities of the Programme conducted in the period 1996-1997 (see paragraph 113 above).
The Office for Outer Space Affairs will prepare a study on basic space science in developing countries. E. Safety aspects
BDT of ITU has a programme from 1994 to 1999 to elaborate master plans for the implementation of GMDSS and the development of maritime radiocommunication services.
ITU Radiocommunication Study Group 8 (mobile, radiodetermination, amateur and related satellite services) continues to examine various aspects of satellite uses in GMDSS, including the characteristics of satellite emergency position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) systems, and to identify requirements for mobile-satellite systems to be employed in GMDSS.
IMO, in close cooperation with the Radiocommunication Bureau of ITU and the International Hydrographic Bureau of the International Hydrographic Organization, has finalized a study on the use of electronic chart display and information systems on board ships, including means of updating electronic navigational charts, which will be broadcast through the Inmarsat enhanced group call and SafetyNET systems.
Operational performance standards for the Electronic Chart Display and Information System have been approved and are being implemented.
The amendments to the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) that were adopted by the 1988 Conference of Contracting Governments entered into force on 1 February 1992, introducing GMDSS.
The system is being introduced in stages and will be fully implemented on 1 February 1999.
Satellite communications form a major part of GMDSS, and all SOLAS ships are requested to carry satellite EPIRB systems.
IMO also continues to prepare the Master Plan of shore-based facilities for GMDSS and provides technical assistance on this matter to developing countries.
The further development of GMDSS to provide for its orderly introduction will be continued by IMO in close cooperation with ITU, WMO, the International Hydrographic Organization, Inmarsat and the International Search and Rescue Satellite System (COSPAS-SARSAT).
The Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/68 of 14 December 1992, are based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, and a process of review and revision has been established.
The recommendations have been recently revised.
In this connection, a joint secretariat of ILO, FAO, WHO, IAEA, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pan American Health Organization followed the most recent recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection in preparing the new International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources, which would be applicable also for sources in outer space.
The Standards were approved by the IAEA Board of Governors in September 1994. An interim edition of the Standards was issued (in English only) pending their formal adoption or acknowledgement by the other sponsoring organizations.
The other five organizations have since then approved the Standards, and the final edition in six languages is to be issued by early 1996.
IAEA has prepared a draft safety practice document entitled Emergency Planning and Preparedness for Re-entry of Nuclear Powered Satellites, the purpose of which is to provide a general overview of the management of incidents or emergencies that may arise when control of satellites is lost, and nuclear power sources employed in space systems re-enter the atmosphere and impact on the Earth's surface.
The document is expected to be published in 1996.
IAEA has published more than 100 documents (standards and guidance) on the safety of reactors in land-based nuclear power plants and also for research reactors in its Safety Series.
Many requirements and recommendations in those publications may be applicable to the safety of nuclear power sources in outer space.
The following international workshops and international or regional conferences are being planned by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications in 1996:
(a) The Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa, to be held in South Africa in October 1996;

(d) A United Nations/Chile/ESA Workshop on Applications of Space Techniques to Prevent and Combat Disasters, to be held in Chile in 1996.
In response to the decision by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/90 to establish an International Space Information Service, the Office for Outer Space Affairs has made progress in developing a limited database capability and to create a homepage on the Internet through which a wide range of information regarding the space-related activities of the United Nations, particularly those of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, can be accessed.
The Office is cooperating with the German Space Agency (DARA) in the preparation of a study on the feasibility of establishing a computer-based international space information service.
Selected manuscripts from the activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications conducted in 1995 at Graz, Austria, and at Oslo (see paragraph 113 above).
The Office for Outer Space Affairs continues to issue the Monthly Survey of Selected Events in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to provide information on worldwide space activities in various fields.
The publication compiles articles selected from a number of periodicals related to space activities.
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles: "Space applications for sustainable development"; "Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation"; "Microsatellites and small satellites: current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation"; and "Global exchange of scientific and technical information: networking possibilities for developing countries".
ESCAP is organizing a meeting of a regional working group on space science and technology development in connection with an expert group meeting on small satellite data applications in May 1996.
This will be followed by a study on small satellite technology development and applications in Asia and the Pacific, to be conducted in 1996.
UNIDO continues to make efforts to promote cooperation between developed and developing countries for maximizing the benefits of space technology spin-offs for developing countries.
The promotion and the outlines of its programme are explained in issue No. 1 of its new quarterly publication High Technology Spin-Offs Monitor, which focuses on this particular subject and technology transfer.
UNIDO is currently presenting its programme to the relevant governmental organizations and industry involved in space activities for their consideration.
The key features of the UNIDO programme are technology spin-off monitoring, assessment and forecasting, establishment of relevant databases, and development of solutions to specific problems related to the technology transfer process and the funding mechanisms for its elements.
The programme also includes assistance to countries in formulating and implementing a national policy and strategy in this area, as well as providing an international framework for the transfer and industrial application of high-technology spin-offs.
Besides the publication of a quarterly Monitor, three TECHMARTs, business forums for technology transfer and joint venture opportunities focusing on high technology spin-offs and their application in industry, will be organized for this purpose.
The problems of industrial applications of high technology spin-offs and commercialization of research and development in this sector will be discussed at the UNIDO regional and international new technology round tables.
The International Bureau of WIPO will convene meetings of consultants in 1996 and 1997 to study the desirability and feasibility of adopting rules and/or recommending principles, common to all countries and interested intergovernmental organizations, for the intellectual property protection of inventions and literary and artistic works which were created or are used in outer space.

INTRODUCTION At its thirty-eighth session, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space noted that, at the thirty-fourth session of the Legal Subcommittee, the Working Group of the Subcommittee on agenda item 4, on matters relating to the definition and delimitation of outer space and to the character and utilization of the geostationary orbit, had finalized the text of a questionnaire on possible legal issues with regard to aerospace objects.
The Committee agreed with the Legal Subcommittee (A/AC.105/607 and Corr.1, para. 38) that the purpose of the questionnaire was to seek the preliminary views of States members of the Committee on various issues relating to aerospace objects.
The Committee also agreed that the replies to the questionnaire could provide a basis for the Legal Subcommittee to decide how it might continue its consideration of agenda item 4.
The Committee further agreed with the Subcommittee that States members of the Committee should be invited to give their opinions on those matters.1
The Secretary-General sent a note verbale dated 21 August 1995 to all States members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space inviting them to communicate to the Secretariat the above-mentioned information so that the Secretariat could prepare a report containing that information for submission to the Legal Subcommittee at its thirty-fifth session.
Information received from Member States by 15 February 1996 is contained in document A/AC.105/635.
The present document was prepared by the Secretariat on the basis of information received from Member States between 16 February and 15 March 1996.REPLIES RECEIVED FROM MEMBER STATES*
travelling through outer space and of using its aerodynamic properties to remain
in airspace for a certain period of time?
Republic of Korea
In principle, an aerospace object can be defined as such.
However, it is necessary to clarify the definition of “for a certain period of time” because it is too vague an expression.
Russian Federation
Such a definition is possible.
But it is based on just two criteria — the capability of an object to travel through outer space and its capability to remain in airspace for a certain period of time.
As aerospace objects become more sophisticated in design, it is clear that their definition will have to be based on additional criteria.
In principle, it is possible at present to state that there are two basic programmes (purposes) for using aerospace objects:
(1) Undertaking a flight from one point on the Earth to another (for this purpose the object may undertake part of its flight in outer space, not attaining cosmic speed); and
(2) Delivering a crew and/or payload into outer space and back to the Earth (its aerodynamic properties at the time of take-off and landing enable the object to remain in airspace for a certain period of time).
Question 2: Does the regime applicable to the flight of aerospace objects differ according
to whether it is located in airspace or outer space?
It is closely related to the question whether an aerospace object is a space object which is subject to space law or is an aircraft which is subject to air law and to the question of the definition and delimitation of outer space.
Under the present international legal system, the legal regime applicable to an aerospace object is different according to its location: the Chicago Convention regime is applied to aircraft in airspace and space law to a space object in outer space.
The legal regime applicable to an aerospace object's flight must differ according to the purpose of the flight and must be determined in accordance with the corresponding norms of international space or air law; that requires further development of certain norms of international air law and international space law, specifically those relating to international liability for any damage sustained, rescue of crew, etc.
The regime of an aerospace object undertaking an Earth-to-Earth mission without entering outer space is determined by the norms of international air law while an aerospace object undertaking an Earth-orbit mission comes within the jurisdiction of international space law.
Question 3: Are there special procedures for aerospace objects, considering the diversity of
their functional characteristics, the aerodynamic properties and space technologies
The current international legal system does not provide for any special legal procedures for aerospace objects which take into account the diversity of their functional characteristics, their aerodynamic properties and their design features.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a unified regime for aerospace objects in order to prevent legal disorder which might arise as the outer space activities using aerospace objects are gradually increasing.
Furthermore, such special procedures as a unified regime need to be prepared by a neutral relevant international organization.
There are no generally accepted procedures for aerospace objects.
The argument could be put forward, somewhat cautiously, that at the present stage of the development of aerospace objects there is no very urgent need to develop such procedures.
However, as these objects become more and more diversified and their number increases, and as the probability increases of various incidents occurring in connection with their operation, the question of supplementing and elaborating norms in the area of space and air law to take account of the special features of aerospace objects might well actually arise.
As far as one can tell at present, the issue of paramount importance will be whether or not procedures should be brought into effect for notifying States of the passage of aerospace objects through airspace over their territories.
The regime applied (emphasizing principles and norms of international air law or international space law) will most probably be established with reference to a number of features, the most fundamental being the designation of the aerospace object, i.e., according to whether the aerospace object is a transportation system intended for the carriage of a payload and/or passengers from one point on the Earth to another, or, alternatively, whether it is designed to be launched into outer space.
Question 4: Are aerospace objects while in airspace considered as aircraft, and while in
does either air law or space law prevail during the flight of an aerospace
According to the spatial approach, an aerospace object is deemed as an aircraft subject to air law in airspace and is deemed as a space object subject to space law in outer space.
But those who are following the functional approach assert that the legal regime of an aerospace object is decided depending on the purpose or function of its flight.
Given such legal problems as sovereignty over airspace, aerial safety and so on, the spatial approach has more merit than the functional approach under the present international legal system because the former can more easily decide the law to be applied.
Until special procedures about an aerospace object are prepared, the aerospace object flying in the airspace, especially in a certain State's territorial airspace, is considered as an aircraft and the aerospace object located in outer space is considered as a space object which is subject to space law.
It can be argued that the criterion to be applied in determining whether an aerospace object comes within the jurisdiction of international space law or that of international air law is the purpose of the object's flight.
As aerospace technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, the question might arise as to whether the existing provisions of international space and air law need to be supplemented.
Question 5: Are the take-off and landing phases specially distinguished in the regime for
airspace from outer space orbit and subsequent return to that orbit?
Under the present legal system, there is no special regime which distinguishes the take-off and landing phases of an aerospace object as involving a different degree of regulation from entry into airspace from outer space orbit and subsequent return to that orbit.
However, in case of its passage over a certain State's territorial airspace after entry into airspace, international air law or the relevant State's domestic law can be applied to the aerospace object in relation to the country's sovereignty and security problem.
At the present time, the practical approach to tackling the problem of establishing such a distinction entails elaborating appropriate criteria and mechanisms for regulating these aspects of the regime governing aerospace objects and subsequently codifying them in norms of international space law.
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State, it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law.
With regard to aerospace objects performing Earth-orbit flights with flight paths passing through the airspace of another State, it is worth while examining the possibility of codifying in treaty form whatever norm is agreed upon for the peaceful (innocent) passage through the airspace of such States when the object enters orbit and when it returns from orbit.
In this regard, it is possible that the special features of Earth-to-Earth and Earth-orbit flights will need to be taken into consideration, since, in the case of objects performing Earth-orbit flights, it will be almost impossible in practical terms to meet all the different requirements of air law.
Question 7: Are there precedents with respect to the passage of aerospace objects after
with respect to such passage?
There are no international customary laws or precedents with respect to the passage of an aerospace object after re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
Until now many space objects were launched into outer space, but it does not mean that its passage over airspace after re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere constitutes any precedents or customary law.
The fact that most of the countries did not raise any objection to the passage of space objects over their airspace does not signify their approval of the passage as international practice or precedents; they just did not have any information about the passage and there was no special perceptible disadvantage with the passage at that time.
There are such precedents.
According to the international practice which is now evolving, a State's sovereignty does not extend to the space located above the orbit of least perigee of an artificial Earth satellite (approximately 100 km above sea level).
There have been relatively few instances of space objects flying over the territories of foreign States.
In cases where the object has flown at an altitude below the above-mentioned level, the registering States have furnished the relevant information to the States whose territory was thus overflown on the basis of goodwill.
For example, in March 1990 the United States of America communicated to the USSR information regarding the final flight stage of the Atlantis multi-use craft.
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit, its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth's atmosphere above open sea, and technical details of the craft's state.
Information received only a few hours before the overflight took place was transmitted as a courtesy.
An agreement was reached establishing that the fact that this information was furnished should not be deemed to set a precedent.
None the less, the transmission of this kind of information suggests the broad lines of the procedures to be followed in notifying States.
Provisions of international customary law with respect to the passage of aerospace objects after re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere are currently in the process of being elaborated.
As we know, there are no regulations in the Republic of Korea which govern the passage of space objects after their re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
No international norms are found in this regard.
The Russian Federation Act on Space Activity, adopted in 1993, is somewhat innovatory in its approach to regulating such passage, providing as it does in its Article 19 that a space object of a foreign State may make a single innocent flight through airspace of the Russian Federation for the purpose of that object's entry into orbit around the Earth and subsequently into outer space, and also for the purpose of its return to Earth provided that the competent authorities of the Russian Federation are given sufficient advance notice of the time, location and path of such a flight and other information pertaining to it.
Generally speaking, such passage is not an area covered by international treaty law pertaining to space.
However, individual aspects of such passage (such as international liability, rescue of astronauts, return of objects, and so forth) are either dealt with or assumed in the multilateral agreements in effect.
It would be well advised to elaborate international legal norms with regard to all issues of relevance raised by such passage.
Question 9: Are the rules concerning the registration of objects launched into outer
space applicable to aerospace objects?
As the term “space object” in the Convention includes such object as is launched into orbits over Earth and outer space, it is difficult to conclude that the term “space object” in the Convention includes the aerospace object.
From the position taken in the answer to question 3, it follows that a new registration procedure which reflects the characteristics of aerospace objects is necessary and to be prepared.
It would be premature at the present time to make amendments or additions to the registration rules established by the 1975 Registration Convention in order to take account of the special characteristics of aerospace objects.
In the medium term, however, as the design of aerospace objects develops, such changes may be considered worth while.
In particular, in addition to the information listed with respect to orbital parameters, further information could be required on the planned flight path of the aerospace object through the airspace above States' territories.
It might be possible to offer a definitive opinion on this subject after further investigation of the features distinguishing the operation of aerospace objects.
The accepted notion of “launching State” will have to be analysed in the light of any new means developed in the future for launching aerospace objects.
A State allowing a foreign aerospace object to be started up from its own airspace is automatically regarded, under the space law currently in effect, as one of the launching States with the concomitant international obligations under the 1972 Liability Convention.

INTRODUCTION At its thirty-eighth session, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space noted that, at the thirty-fourth session of the Legal Subcommittee, the Working Group of the Subcommittee on agenda item 4, on matters relating to the definition and delimitation of outer space and to the character and utilization of the geostationary orbit, had finalized the text of a questionnaire on possible legal issues with regard to aerospace objects.
The Committee agreed with the Legal Subcommittee (A/AC.105/607 and Corr.1, para. 38) that the purpose of the questionnaire was to seek the preliminary views of States members of the Committee on various issues relating to aerospace objects.
The Committee also agreed that the replies to the questionnaire could provide a basis for the Legal Subcommittee to decide how it might continue its consideration of agenda item 4.
The Committee further agreed with the Subcommittee that States members of the Committee should be invited to give their opinions on those matters.1
The Secretary-General sent a note verbale dated 21 August 1995 to all States members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space inviting them to communicate to the Secretariat the above-mentioned information so that the Secretariat could prepare a report containing that information for submission to the Legal Subcommittee at its thirty-fifth session.

travelling through outer space and of using its aerodynamic properties to remain
in airspace for a certain period of time?
Concerning the definition of an aerospace object, while we agree generally with question 1, which considers the twofold capacity to “travel” and to “fly into orbit” as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object, we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology, and therefore we advise, in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution, to thoroughly examine the “aerospace object” requisites. Question 2: Does the regime applicable to the flight of aerospace objects differ according
Following the Government's opinion, and on the basis of present technical results, the so-called “aerospace object” is conceived as and destined to a unitary function, meant for activities in outer space.
The operational circumstance of crossing the Earth's atmosphere does not affect the mission's singleness under a unified regime.

developed for such objects?
Following the Government's opinion, and consistent with the unitary solution proposed at point 2, this point lacks juridical value and should be reformulated.
Question 4: Are aerospace objects while in airspace considered as aircraft, and while in outer
air law or space law prevail during the flight of an aerospace craft, depending on the
destination of such a flight? Question 5: Are the take-off and landing phases specially distinguished in the regime for

object of one State while it is in the airspace of another State?
Keeping particularly into account the phase of re-entry into airspace and the relevant flight activities of the “aerospace object”, while observing the unified character of the above mission which prevents a positive answer to question 6, it is advisable to examine such flight activity with respect to the existing rules of air navigation in order to solve possible interferences.
Question 7: Are there precedents with respect to the passage of aerospace objects after
re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere and does international customary law exist
with respect to such passage? Following the Italian Government's opinion, the issue should be re-examined keeping into account solutions mentioned at points 2 and 6.
Question 9: Are the rules concerning the registration of objects launched into outer
space applicable to aerospace objects ?
As far as the registration of the object is concerned, although in our opinion objectives and aims provided by the existing international Convention are not fully applicable to the aerospace object, it is advisable to thoroughly examine the matter in order to check the need or opportunity for a “registration”, also keeping into account the shortness of the “orbiting phase” generally attributed to the aerospace object.

INTRODUCTION At its thirty-eighth session, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space noted that, at the thirty-fourth session of its Legal Subcommittee, the working group of the Subcommittee on agenda item 4, on matters relating to the definition and delimitation of outer space and to the character and utilization of the geostationary orbit, had finalized the text of a questionnaire on possible legal issues with regard to aerospace objects.
The Committee agreed with the Legal Subcommittee (A/AC.105/607 and Corr.1, para. 38) that the purpose of the questionnaire was to seek the preliminary views of States members of the Committee on various issues relating to aerospace objects.
The Committee also agreed that the replies to the questionnaire could provide a basis for the Legal Subcommittee to decide how it might continue its consideration of agenda item 4.
The Secretary-General addressed a note verbale dated 21 August 1995 to all Member States of the Committee inviting them to communicate to the Secretariat the information requested above in order for the Secretariat to prepare a report containing the information for submission to the Legal Subcommittee.
Information received from Member States by 15 February 1996 is contained in document A/AC.105/635, and information received by 15 March 1996 is contained in A/AC.105/635/Add.1.
Information received by 18 March 1996 is contained in A/AC.105/635/Add.2.
In reply to a note verbale from the Secretary-General dated 16 July 1996, the present document was prepared by the Secretariat on the basis of information received from Member States by 30 November 1996.
REPLIES RECEIVED FROM MEMBER STATESThe replies are reproduced in the form in which they were received.
Question 1: Can an aerospace object be defined as an object which is capable both of travelling through outer space and of using its aerodynamic properties to remain
in airspace for a certain period of time? Chile
In general, we agree with the suggested definition of an aerospace object, in so far as the aerospace object is performing a space mission.
Greece
Yes.
Accordingly, in order to underline the primary function of aerospace objects, consisting to serve space activities, it seems necessary to complete the proposed definition by adding to its end the following phrase: "... [to remain in airspace for a certain period of time] for [primarily] [exclusively] space purposes". Kazakstan
Syrian Arab Republic
Yes.
Turkey
An aerospace object may also be able to "stand still" at certain special and strategically important positions like the Lagrangian points of any "binary" celestial system like Earth-Moon or Earth-Sun without any energy expenditure.
Therefore, a definition should also include the words "or staying in" after the words "travelling through ...".
On the other hand, the definition of an "aerospace object" has yet to be developed to reach a consensus.
This concept should be first defined scientifically before a legal definition is accepted.
Question 2: Does the regime applicable to the flight of aerospace objects differ according to whether it is located in airspace or outer space?
In any case, in this regard, it would be more useful to formulate provisions on the innocent passage of a space object over national airspace.
No, there is no reason to differentiate the legal regime of the flight of aerospace objects ratione loci.
In fact, the overall flight of aerospace objects should be submitted to a sole legal regime, exactly to avoid unnecessary dualism (more or less justified in the case of the territorial and open sea because of the very low speed of ships and other similar factors), which undoubtedly produce confusion and malfunction of the whole legal system governing space activities
Yes, such a distinction should be made.
The regime applicable to aerospace objects whether they are located in airspace or in outer space should differ since there are important differences in physical constraints and physical laws that apply in each medium.
Especially landing conditions of aerospace objects need to be defined in detail.
We also should not forget that, other than aerospace objects, "space-only objects", in the same context, should be separately defined as mentioned in answer 1.
These latter objects may be under the same legal consideration as aerospace objects in outer space.
Question 3: Are there special procedures for aerospace objects, considering the diversity of their functional characteristics, the aerodynamic properties and space technologies used, and their design features, or should a single or unified regime be developed for such objects?
In our view, a uniform regime applicable to space objects will always be preferable.
No, there are no special procedures based on these factors.
On the contrary, in view of the above (Question 2), it is necessary to adopt a single or unified legal regime for aerospace objects, exactly to make their use less complicated.
Aerospace objects should be differentiated from each other according to their characteristics.
Single or multiple regimes should be developed to cover all aspects involved.
If the concept of "aerospace objects" is not extended to include the proposed "space-only objects" (i.e. object with all the capabilities of aerospace objects, but not capable of flying in airspace), a regime probably similar to aerospace objects could be considered.
However, since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area, a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage.
space as spacecraft, with all the legal consequences that follow therefrom, or does either air law or space law prevail during the flight of an aerospace craft, depending on the destination of such a flight?
We consider that, in view of the diversity of missions and legislation applicable to each case, it is advisable that only one type of law prevail, depending on the destination of the particular flight.
Space law should prevail in the overall flight of aerospace objects; if they are destined to serve primarily outer space activities, i.e. all their flight phases from their launching from Earth to orbiting in outer space or landing on any other celestial body or space platform and, vice versa, to their return back to Earth.
Of course, it is self-evident that all air law rules concerning safety of air navigation should also be jointly applicable.
The law applicable to the type of space in which the aerospace object is located should prevail.
It can be argued that the criterion to be applied in determining whether an aerospace object comes within the jurisdiction of international space law or that of international air law is the purpose of the object's flight.
As aerospace technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, the question might arise as to whether the existing provisions of international space and air law need to be supplemented.
Aerospace objects in airspace should not be considered as aircraft since special conditions will always apply to their design, manoeuvre and landing procedures.
Existing international aviation rules as well as national legislation and air traffic arrangements should be taken into account.
Question 5: Are the take-off and landing phases specially distinguished in the regime for an aerospace object as involving a different degree of regulation from entry into airspace from outer space orbit and subsequent return to that orbit?
Although there are no provisions currently in effect which specifically regulate aerospace flights at the stage of entry into national airspace, we feel that in the interests of the uniformity of the relevant legislation one should stay with the mission of the aerospace object and regulate the latter's innocent passage only.
No, there is no reason to separate and distinguish these two flight phases of aerospace objects from their other flight phases, and submit them to another legal regime, because, as explained above (Question 4), their overall flight is governed by space law.
At the present time the practical approach to tackling the problem of establishing such a distinction entails elaborating appropriate criteria and mechanisms for regulating these aspects of the regime governing aerospace objects and subsequently codifying them in norms of international law.
Take-off and landing phases of aerospace objects will include many of the precautions of existing air traffic regulations.
However, there may be special requirements different in the take-off and in landing from the existing rules.
object of one State while it is in the airspace of another State?
One should stay with the nature of the mission.
If it is a space mission, the norms of air law should not apply to its outgoing and return flight paths.
On the other hand, if the same spacecraft overshoots and flies over airspace outside its outgoing and return flight paths, then it should no longer be covered by space law.
Aerospace objects as submitted to space law should be treated as spacecraft while in the airspace either of the launching State (as defined in Article I of the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space), the (normal or accidental) landing State or any other third State.
The registration by a State in its appropriate registries of any flying object as an aircraft or a spacecraft is the formal criterion for the application to it of its respective national and international air or space law rules.
Nevertheless, in both cases, air law norms concerning safety of air navigation should be applicable.
Yes, those norms are applicable.
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State, it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law.
Any object in the air space of a State needs to comply with the International Civil Aviation Convention (ICAC).
On the other hand, when such an object is within the airspace of a State, national legal norms could be applicable.
Question 7: Are there precedents with respect to the passage of aerospace objects after re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere and does international customary law exist with respect to such passage?
There are indeed precedents relating to aerospace objects, such as space shuttles, in respect of their aerodynamic characteristics.
Similarly, customary law does exist with respect to such aerospace objects, whereby they are regarded as craft performing a space mission to which the norms of air law do not apply.
In our view, re-entries into Earth's atmosphere of all United States Space Shuttles, which were successively flown above the national airspace of many third States, may be considered as precedents of a kind of innocent passage.
Thus, due to the fact that no objection or opposition was raised by these States, it follows that an international customary law right was then created with respect to such passage, as it happened earlier in the case of the first artificial Earth satellite.
Yes, there are precedents for such passage involving space objects of the Russian Federation.
Such passage was provided for under the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakstan of 28 March 1994 on the Main Principles and Conditions for Utilization of the Baikonur Launch Site.
No specific international customary law exists, with respect to such passage of aerospace objects over foreign territories.
No such precedents are traced with respect to Syria.
There are a number of incidents where fragments of space objects have fallen onto "unwelcomed" territories.
However, to our knowledge there are no well-defined international practices in such cases.
Some regulations need to be established.
Question 8: Are there any national and/or international legal norms with respect to the passage of space objects after re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere?
At the present time, in view of the recent development of the aerospace object system, there are no specific norms applicable to such objects in either national or international law.
However, as far as the development of space activity is concerned, the norms applicable to such objects should be those space treaties currently in effect.
No such information is available.
Such norms are contained in the Act of the Republic of Kazakstan on Space Activity currently being drafted.
Norms of this kind also appear in international space agreements.
Present national and international legal norms should apply with respect to space and aerospace objects after re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
The relevant United Nations Treaties and Principles relating to various aspects of the issue should also be considered.
Question 9: Are the rules concerning the registration of objects launched into outer space applicable to aerospace objects ?
Aerospace objects should be subject to the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, which should be applied in this regard.
Yes, because, exactly, the responsibility and liability of the launching state is founded on this registration.
Such rules are defined in the international Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space.
Yes, this is possible and necessary, since some such objects will in future operate regularly as space and air objects.
All aerospace objects should be registered as "spacecraft" and also as "aircraft".
However, the registration of space transportation objects that will be assembled in space and will never land on Earth (i.e. manufactured at the Space Station and other similar space platforms) starting their travels from and to such platforms practically never making an aerial flight, should also be registered and their routes and destinations should be declared for avoiding any incidents.
General Responses
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The Government of the United Kingdom acknowledges the importance of the subject and the future possible implications of considering legal issues in this area of aerospace objects, but regrets to inform the Secretary-General that the questionnaire is still under active discussion in both national and European contexts.
The matter will be kept under close review and an agreed response to the questionnaire will be forwarded to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in due course.

The Subcommittee continued to stress the necessity of ensuring continuous and effective consultations and coordination in the field of outer space activities among organizations within the United Nations system and the avoidance of duplication of activities.
The Subcommittee noted that future sessions of the Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities would be convened at the United Nations Office at Vienna, and hosted by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, prior to the sessions of the Committee each year, without prejudice to any invitation by an interested agency to host a session at its headquarters.
E. Regional and interregional cooperation
The Subcommittee noted that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, had reaffirmed its approval of the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 regarding the establishment and strengthening of regional mechanisms of cooperation, and their promotion and creation through the United Nations system.
The Subcommittee noted with satisfaction that, in carrying out various activities in the implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE 82, the Secretariat had sought to strengthen those mechanisms.
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45/72 of 11 December 1990, in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries.
The Subcommittee also noted that, once established, each centre could expand and become part of a network that could cover specific programme elements in established institutions related to space technology in each region.
The Subcommittee further noted that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, had endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that the centres be established on the basis of affiliation to the United Nations as early as possible, and that such affiliation would provide the centres with the necessary recognition and strengthen the possibilities of attracting donors and of establishing academic relationships with national and international space-related institutions.
The Subcommittee noted that during the consideration by the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly of the item on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, in November 1995, Brazil and Mexico had informed the Fourth Committee that they had reached agreement on all aspects relating to the establishment of the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In this regard, the delegations of those countries stressed their expectation that the necessary coordination between the organs of the United Nations that were involved in the matter and the host countries would further expedite the establishment of the Centre.
The Subcommittee noted that the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific had been inaugurated in India in November 1995, that participation in the governing board of the Centre and in its activities would be open to Member States of the region, and that, in due course and upon approval by its Governing Board, the Centre would grow into a network of nodes enabling it to fully utilize the resources and potential of the region.
The Subcommittee noted with satisfaction that the first education programme of the Centre would begin in April 1996.
The Subcommittee noted that an amendment to the agreement establishing the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific, proposed by the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was under consideration by the Governing Board of the Centre.
Some delegations expressed the view that they were concerned about the procedural and substantial problems relating to the establishment of the Centre for the region of Asia and the Pacific.
Those delegations stated that since there were serious differences on matters of principle in relation to the establishment of the Centre, and since the growth of the Centre into a network of nodes was an objective that had not been realized, it was necessary to carry out further consultations so that a fair and reasonable solution could be achieved.
Some delegations also expressed the view that consensus on the establishment and development of the Centre with the full understanding of all interested States in the region was required.
Those delegations stated that there were still States in the region hesitating to sign the agreement; that it was important to establish a fuller understanding of the relationship between the Centre and the related programmes of regional institutions such as the ESCAP cooperative programme; and that there was a need to fully understand how the two programmes could operate as integrated regional components of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
Those delegations expressed the hope that further efforts would be made by the Office for Outer Space Affairs to foster consensus on those matters among all interested States in the region.
Other delegations stated that during the entire process leading to the establishment of the Centre, both the Subcommittee and the Committee had been kept fully informed, and that all necessary steps had been taken to ensure transparency.
They pointed out that the appropriate forum for making proposals relating to the functioning of the Centre was the Governing Board of the Centre, as only it could decide on matters such as the establishment of nodes and the relationship that the Centre should have with other international bodies.
The Subcommittee noted that the offers and commitments of both Morocco and Nigeria favoured, in each case, the early establishment, operation and long-term sustainability of a centre in Morocco for the French-speaking African countries, and in Nigeria for the English-speaking African countries.
The Subcommittee also noted that both countries were developing cooperation agreements that would be entered into by the Member States concerned later in the year.
The Subcommittee noted that discussions were in progress with the parties concerned on the establishment of the regional centre for the Middle East.
The Subcommittee also noted that the Syrian Arab Republic had indicated its interest in hosting such a centre for the region covered by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).
The Subcommittee noted that discussions were in progress with the parties concerned on the establishment of the regional centre for Europe.
In that connection, the Subcommittee also noted the offers of Greece, Romania and some other Member States to host, or serve as a node for, such a regional centre covering the region of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE).
The Subcommittee noted the nomination of a facility in Greece that amply fulfilled the requirements of the proposed regional educational centre, namely a facility that had hosted a United Nations workshop on space communications for development.
The Subcommittee noted, in addition, that Romania had presented a detailed offer, including explicit infrastructure and financial arrangements.
The Subcommittee further noted that Italy had reaffirmed its willingness to assist in the establishment of such centres in developing countries, and had in particular called for the establishment of a centre for the countries of central and eastern Europe.
The Subcommittee noted that the delegations of Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, Romania and Turkey, after consultations among themselves, had agreed that, instead of establishing a centralized institution such as a centre, it would be more appropriate to establish an educational system consisting of a network of space science and technology education institutions, and that the activities of each member of the network would be in harmony with relevant existing institutions in Europe and open to international cooperation, to be determined after appropriate consultations.
The Subcommittee noted that the ECA secretariat was providing support for the activities of the ECA regional remote sensing centres, and that the ESCAP secretariat was implementing several of the recommendations contained in the Action Plan on Space Applications for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region that had emanated from the Ministerial Conference on Space Applications for Development in Asia and the Pacific Region, held at Beijing in 1994.
The Subcommittee noted that a Cooperative Information Network Linking Scientists, Educators and Professionals in Africa (COPINE) project would offer an excellent opportunity to develop space applications for Africa, and that the proposed system would allow for the exchange of information needed to promote progress in health care, agriculture, education, science and technology, and the management and survey of natural resources and the environment.
The Subcommittee noted that such cooperation would provide long-term benefits to the participating African and European countries and would contribute to economic growth in Africa.
The Subcommittee noted the contributions made by specialized agencies and other international organizations towards the promotion of international cooperation in space activities: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was continuing its activities relating to the remote sensing of renewable natural resources and environmental monitoring, including training courses and the support of development projects; ITU was continuing its work in the international coordination of space communications, including providing technical assistance to developing countries; WMO was continuing international cooperative programmes using space technology, including the World Weather Watch and the Tropical Cyclone Programme; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was promoting applications of space technology for archaeology, and strengthening international and interdisciplinary cooperation between archaeological projects; UNIDO was continuing its work on spin-off benefits of space technology; the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) was continuing to develop its satellite communication system for maritime, aeronautical and land-mobile communications, including the development of small, low-cost terminals and the provision of technical assistance and training; INTELSAT was further developing its system for international satellite communications and broadcasting, including its programmes for training and technical assistance; ESA was continuing its programme of international cooperative space activities, including training programmes for the benefit of developing countries, support of the activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications and technical assistance projects; and ICAO was continuing its work towards implementation of communications, navigation and surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) systems.
The Subcommittee emphasized the importance of regional and international cooperation in making the benefits of space technology available to all countries by such cooperative activities as shared payloads, dissemination of information on spin-off benefits, ensuring compatibility of space systems and providing access to launch capabilities at reasonable cost.
Some delegations expressed the view that the Space Agency Forum could be invited to participate in the meetings of the Subcommittee at future sessions.
III. MATTERS RELATING TO REMOTE SENSING OF THE EARTH
BY SATELLITES INCLUDING, INTER ALIA, APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, paragraph 17 (a) (iii), the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item relating to remote sensing of the Earth.
In the course of the debate, delegations reviewed the national and cooperative programmes in remote sensing.
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral, regional and international cooperation, including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries.
Countries with advanced capabilities in the field, including some developing countries, described programmes to provide assistance to developing countries.
The Subcommittee took note of the continuing programmes of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Morocco, Russian Federation, Ukraine, United States and ESA for remote sensing satellites.
The Subcommittee noted that the launches of the European Remote Sensing (ERS-2) satellite and the RADARSAT satellite of Canada would provide valuable microwave data to complement the data from ERS-1 and from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), as well as the visible and infrared data from satellites of the Landsat, Resurs, SPOT, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) and Marine Observation Satellite (MOS) series and that the launch of IRS-1C would also provide valuable visible and infrared data.
The Subcommittee also noted the remote sensing systems being developed for future launch, including SAC-B and SAC-C of Argentina, FY-2 of China, RADARSAT-II of Canada, CBERS of China and Brazil, IRS-P3 of India, ADEOS-1 and 2 of Japan and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) of the United States and Japan, and various systems of the Russian Federation.
It also took note of the activities of ISPRS in promoting international cooperation in remote sensing and image processing.
The Subcommittee heard a scientific and technical presentation on the remote sensing activities of India and Morocco, noted the useful applications of SPOT data in mapping desertification, and heard a presentation by ISPRS on high-resolution imaging systems, as described in paragraph 19 of the present report.
The Subcommittee reiterated its view that remote sensing activities should take into account the need to provide appropriate and non-discriminatory assistance to meet the needs of developing countries.
The Subcommittee emphasized the importance of making remote sensing data and analysed information openly available to all countries at reasonable cost and in a timely manner.
The Subcommittee also recognized the example of international cooperation in WMO in the exchange of meteorological data as provided for in resolution 11.4/1 adopted at the XIIth WMO Congress on 21 June 1995.
Some delegations called attention to the international cooperation given by some members through traditionally free and open provisions of meteorological satellite data, and encouraged those countries to continue that practice.
The Subcommittee considered that international cooperation in the use of remote sensing satellites should be encouraged, both through coordination of the operations of ground stations and through regular meetings between satellite operators and users.
It noted the importance of compatibility and complementarity of existing and future remote sensing systems, as well as the need for continuity in the acquisition of data.
The Subcommittee also noted the importance, particularly for developing countries, of sharing experiences and technologies, of cooperation through international and regional remote sensing centres, and of joint work on collaborative projects.
The Subcommittee further noted the value of remote sensing systems for environmental monitoring and, in that context, stressed the need for the international community to utilize fully remote sensing data in an effort to implement fully the recommendations contained in Agenda 211 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Brazil in 1992.
Some delegations expressed the view that the international community should organize, on an annual basis, an International Space Day, which would be celebrated through special events, such as symposia, conferences and technical meetings, in all countries.
Recalling General Assembly resolution 41/65, annex, of 3 December 1986, by which the Assembly had adopted the Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space, the Subcommittee recommended that at its thirty-fourth session it should continue its discussion on remote sensing activities conducted in accordance with those Principles during its consideration of the agenda item concerning remote sensing.
The Subcommittee recommended that the item should be retained on its agenda as a priority item for its next session.
IV. USE OF NUCLEAR POWER SOURCES IN OUTER SPACE
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, paragraph 17 (a) (iv), the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item relating to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space.
The Subcommittee recalled that the General Assembly had adopted the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, as contained in its resolution 47/68 of 14 December 1992.
The Subcommittee noted that at its thirty-eighth session the Committee had recalled (A/50/20, para. 62) that it had agreed, at its thirty-seventh session, that the Principles should remain in their current form until amended, and that before amendment, proper consideration should be given to the aims and objectives of any proposed revision (A/49/20, para. 68).
The Subcommittee agreed that, at the present time, revision of the Principles was not warranted.
The Subcommittee also recalled that at its previous session it had agreed (A/AC.105/605, para. 66) that regular discussions on that issue should continue at future sessions and that the Subcommittee and the Working Group on nuclear power sources should continue to receive the widest input on matters affecting the use of nuclear power sources in outer space and any contribution related to improving the scope and application of the Principles.
The Subcommittee noted the statement made by IAEA emphasizing that it was important that the safety principles for nuclear power sources in outer space should be consistent with the most recent international recommendations on radiation protection, which were based on the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources, jointly adopted by FAO, IAEA, the International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (Nuclear Energy Agency) and the Pan American Health Organization.
The Subcommittee also noted that the new Safety Practice document on Emergency Planning and Preparedness for Re-Entry of a Nuclear-Powered Satellite had been approved by IAEA and was due to be published in its final form in 1996.
Mindful of the differences in the safety Principles applied for space and the safety standards for terrestrial systems, the Subcommittee agreed that the study of those developments, arising from the latest International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommendations, should be continued.
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Working Group on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space was reconvened on 21 February 1996 under the chairmanship of Professor D. Rex (Germany).
No further work was undertaken in the Working Group during the session.
The Subcommittee noted that in response to its recommendation, the General Assembly, in resolution 50/27, paragraph 21, had invited Member States to report to the Secretary-General on a regular basis with regard to national and international research concerning the safety of nuclear-powered satellites.
The Subcommittee also noted that the General Assembly, in paragraph 37 of the same resolution, had considered that, to the extent possible, information on the problem of collisions of space objects, including those with nuclear power sources, with space debris, should be provided to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, in order to allow it to follow that area more closely.
The Subcommittee noted that information had been submitted in response to those requests, as contained in document A/AC.105/619 and Add.1, by Canada, Chile, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.
The Subcommittee heard scientific and technical presentations on the topic of nuclear power sources by the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, as described in paragraph 19 of the present report.
The Subcommittee took note of the working paper submitted by the United Kingdom on the interpretation and development of safety principles for nuclear power sources in space (A/AC.105/C.1/L.203) and by the Russian Federation on the problem of collisions between nuclear power sources in space and space debris (A/AC.105/C.1/L.204).
The Subcommittee also took note of a view that was expressed on the supplementary principles on nuclear power sources in space, as contained in the working paper submitted by the United Kingdom, that further discussions should be held on concepts such as risk justification, maximum tolerable risk, risk reduction and the numerical values related to these, as described in the paper.
The Subcommittee agreed that Member States should continue to be invited to report to the Secretary-General on a regular basis with regard to national and international research concerning the safety of space objects with nuclear power sources.
The Subcommittee also agreed that further studies should be conducted on the issue of the collision of orbiting space objects with nuclear power sources on board with space debris and that it should be kept informed of the results of such studies.
Some delegations expressed the view that in due time supplementary principles might be a way to update the existing Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space.
The view was expressed that the Principles adopted in 1992 were, implicitly, mainly devoted to the protection of the biosphere, as it was the obvious priority goal; that, even if it was premature to review and revise the Principles, it could be recognized that there was a need to add specific chapters devoted to the other aspects; and that, in that spirit, the Subcommittee could assume the duty of identifying and assessing the technical aspects related to the use and management of nuclear power sources on the Moon and other celestial bodies.
The Subcommittee recommended that the item be retained on its agenda for the next session and that the time allocated to the topic in both the Working Group and the Subcommittee should be adjusted as appropriate.
V. SPACE DEBRIS
A. General matters
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration, on a priority basis, of the agenda item on space debris.
The Subcommittee agreed that consideration of space debris was important, and that international cooperation was needed to expand appropriate and affordable strategies to minimize the potential impact of space debris on future space missions.
The Subcommittee agreed that it could be desirable to compile information on various steps taken by space agencies for reducing the growth or damage potential of space debris and to encourage common acceptance by the international community, on a voluntary basis.
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the report prepared by the Secretariat on this subject (A/AC.105/620), and recommended that it should be updated annually.
The Subcommittee took note of the following programmes of Member States and organizations on the acquisition and understanding of data on the characteristics of the space debris environment, and on measuring, modelling and mitigating the orbital debris environment.
These programmes include the Material Exposure in Low Earth Orbit (MELEO) experiment and the Advanced Composite Material Exposure Experiment (ACOMEX) of Canada; the Tracking and Image Radar Station (TIRA) of Germany; the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), the Haystack Orbital Debris Radar, the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres (ODERACS-1 and 2), the Charged Couple Device (CCD) Debris Telescope and the Liquid Metal Mirror Telescope (LMMT) of the United States; the Communication Research Laboratory (CRL) telescope system and Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU) radar system of Japan; the various monitoring facilities and analytical models established by the Russian Federation; and the Space Debris Reference Model (MASTER) of ESA .
The Subcommittee noted that cooperation continued through the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), with the participation of Japan, NASA, ESA, and the Russian Space Agency (RSA), and from 1995, the Chinese National Space Agency, to enable its members to exchange information on space debris activities, facilitate opportunities for cooperation in space debris research, review the progress of ongoing activities, and identify debris mitigation options.
Recognizing the relevance of the work of IADC and its member agencies to the work of the Subcommittee, the Subcommittee agreed that IADC should be invited to give a presentation at the next session of the Subcommittee.
The Subcommittee agreed that Member States should pay more attention to the problem of collisions of space objects, including those with nuclear power sources on board, with space debris, and other aspects of space debris.
It noted that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, had called for the continuation of national research on that question, for the development of improved technology for the monitoring of space debris, and for the compilation and dissemination of data on space debris.
The Subcommittee recalled the request of the Assembly that information on those issues should be submitted to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, and took note of the reports contained in documents A/AC.105/619 and Add.1 submitted to it in accordance with that request.
The Subcommittee further agreed that national research on space debris should continue, and that Member States should make the results of that research available to all interested parties.
The Subcommittee heard scientific and technical presentations on the subject of space debris by France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States and ESA as mentioned in paragraph 18 of the present report.
The Subcommittee took note of the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation on the work done by Russian Federation scientists on the problem of the technogenic pollution of near space (A/AC.105/C.1/L.205).
The Subcommittee noted that a certain amount of research on space debris had already been undertaken in some countries, which had allowed for a better understanding of the sources of debris, the areas in near-Earth orbit that were reaching high levels of space debris density, the probabilities and effects of collisions and the necessity of minimizing the creation of space debris.
The Subcommittee encouraged Member States and relevant international organizations to provide information on practices that they had adopted, and that had proven effective in minimizing the creation of space debris.
The Subcommittee recalled that, in order to advance in its consideration of its agenda item on space debris, it had adopted, at its thirty-second session, a multi-year plan for consideration of space debris.
The Subcommittee further recalled that at each session it should review the current operational debris mitigation practices, and consider future mitigation methods with regard to cost efficiency (A/AC.105/605, para. 83).
In accordance with the multi-year plan, the Subcommittee, at its current session, had focused its attention on measurements of space debris, understanding of data and effects of this environment on space systems.
B. Technical report of the Subcommittee for 1996
In the past several years the scientific and technical community had become concerned about the influence of space debris on the space environment and on the operation of spacecraft.
That concern was shared by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and, as a consequence, the item on space debris was put on its agenda in 1994.
It was agreed that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris.
The Subcommittee agreed to focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris, including debris measurement techniques; mathematical modelling of the debris environment; characterizing the space debris environment; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris, including spacecraft design measures to protect against space debris.
Accordingly, a multi-year work plan was adopted in 1995 for specific topics to be covered during the time span 1996-1998.
It was also agreed that this work plan should be implemented with flexibility, so that all relevant issues on space debris can be addressed.
It was understood that space debris are inactive man-made objects, such as spent upper stages, spent satellites, fragments or parts generated during launch or mission operations, or fragments from explosions and other break-ups.
This report of the Subcommittee would be structured according to the specific topics addressed by the work plan during the period 1996-1998.
The report would be carried forward and updated each year, leading to an accumulation of advice and guidance, in order to establish a common understanding that could serve as the basis for further deliberations of COPUOS on this important matter.
The report for 1996 concentrates on the current stage of the multi-year work plan, i.e. measurements of space debris, to be followed in the coming years by the sections on modelling and mitigation.
The following chapter of the Technical Report is still subject to possible technical changes and amendments which will be adopted next year.
1. Measurements of space debris
1.1 Ground-based measurements
1.1.1 Radar measurements
Ground-based radars are well suited to observe space objects because of their all-weather and day-and-night performance.
However, the radar power budget is a limiting factor for detection of small objects at long ranges.
Basically two types of radars are used for space object measurements:
(a) Radars with mechanically controlled beam direction using parabolic reflector antennas.
Only objects being in the actual field-of-view - given by the mechanical direction of the parabolic reflector antenna - can be detected and measured;
(b) Radars with electronically controlled beam direction using phased array antennas.
Hundreds of objects at different directions can be detected and measured simultaneously.
The first type of radar is used mainly for tracking, and the second mainly for search tasks.
The following radar modes are used for observation of space debris: tracking mode; beam-park mode; mixed mode; and bistatic mode.
In the tracking mode the radar follows an object for a few minutes, gaining data on angular direction, range, range-rate, amplitude and phase of the radar echoes.
From the evaluation of direction, speed and range-rate as a function of time, orbital elements can be derived.
In the beam-park mode, the antenna is kept fixed in a given direction and echoes are received from objects passing within its field-of-view.
This gives statistical information on the number and size of the detected objects, but less precise data on their orbit.
In the mixed mode, the radar would start in the beam-park mode and change to the tracking mode when an object passes the beam, thereby gaining more precise orbital data.
Once the data are collected, the radar might return to the beam-park mode.
In the bistatic mode, an additional receiver antenna, separate from the emitting antenna, is used.
From radar measurements principally, the following space object characteristics can be derived:
(a) Orbital elements describing the motion of the object's centre of mass around the Earth;
(b) Attitude describing the motion of the object around its centre of mass;
(c) Size and shape of the object;
(d) Orbital lifetime;
(e) Ballistic coefficient, as defined in paragraph 127 (f), specifying the rate at which the orbital semi-major axis decays;
(f) Object mass;
(g) Material properties.
The deterministic data can go into a catalogue of space objects, as well as the statistical information on numbers of detected objects of a given size in a given region at a certain time.
Current radars are able to detect objects larger than 1 centimetre up to a range of 1,000 kilometres or 1 metre in geostationary orbit (GSO).
In order to detect smaller objects, the bistatic radar mode has to be adopted.
Using this technique, 2-millimetre-sized objects can be detected at ranges of 500 kilometres.
These detection ranges apply to highly reflective objects like metals.
For other materials, like composites, the reflection of radar signals is weaker.
Radar measurements of orbital debris population statistics at sizes below 10 centimetres (the nominal limit for the United States and Russian Federation catalogues) have been conducted by the United States using Haystack and Goldstone radars, and by Germany, using the FGAN radar.
Haystack and Goldstone radars have provided a statistical picture of the low Earth orbit (LEO) debris environment at sizes down to 0.5 centimetre (with some data down to 0.2 centimetre.
FGAN radar measurements have not extended to quite such small sizes, but in general agree with the NASA results.
The picture that emerges from these measurements is that the debris population exceeds the natural meteoroid population for all sizes larger than about 0.01 centimetre in diameter.
The MU radar of Kyoto University of Japan can observe the radar cross-section (RCS) variation of unknown objects for a period of 20 seconds.
A bistatic radar system of the Institute of Space and Astronomical Sciences (ISAS) of Japan can detect objects as small as 2 cm at an altitude of 500 kilometres.
1.1.2 Optical measurements
Optical debris can be detected by reflected sunlight when the debris object is sunlit while the ground below is dark.
However, for objects in high Earth orbit (HEO), such as those in geosynchronous orbit, observations can often be continued during the entire night.
The requirement for clear, dark skies is another limitation on optical measurements.
An advantage of optical measurements over radar measurements is that the signal intensity from reflected sunlight falls off only as the square of the distance or altitude, whereas the radar signal return falls off as the fourth power of distance.
The result is that a telescope of modest size can outperform most radars for detection of debris at extreme altitudes.
Some measurement of small debris in LEO have been done using optical telescopes, but in general, radars outperform telescopes for measurements in LEO.
The United States Space Command employs 1-metre aperture telescopes fitted with intensified vidicon detectors to track HEO objects.
These measurements are used to maintain the HEO part of the Space Command catalogue.
The capability of these telescopes is limited to detection of 1-metre objects at geosynchronous altitudes, corresponding to a limiting stellar magnitude of 16.
Charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors are planned for these telescopes, which will improve their performance.
The Russian Space Agency has a similar telescope capability used to maintain the orbits of HEO objects in their catalogue.
In general, the United States Space Command and the Russian Federation catalogues are concerned with intact spacecraft and rocket bodies.
However, there are reasons to believe that small orbital debris resulting from explosions also exist in the GSO region.
A Russian Federation Ekran satellite in GSO was observed to explode in 1978.
During 1986, many uncatalogued objects were seen in high elliptical orbits at an inclination of 7 degrees, possibly the result of an Ariane geotransfer stage breakup.
The United States Space Command telescope on Maui, Hawaii accidentally observed the breakup of a Titan 4 transtage (1968-081E) in February 1992.
More recently (in February 1994), a Titan 2 transtage (1967-066G) displayed an abrupt orbit discontinuity that indicated that an explosive event had occurred.
There are other Titan transtages near GSO that may still have the potential to explode.
Some of these stages appear to be lost, and may have exploded.
An exceptional combination of sensitivity and field of view is required to survey the GSO region for the small orbital debris that are suspected to exist there.
Most astronomical telescopes that have sufficient sensitivity have a small field-of-view.
This is useful for accurate determination of satellite positions (once their approximate locations are known), but not for surveying large areas of the sky.
Some preliminary measurements have been done to survey the region near GSO for debris objects smaller than 1 metre.
NASA used a small telescope capable of detecting objects as faint as 17.1 stellar magnitude (equivalent to an object of about 0.6 metre in diameter at geosynchronous altitude), with a field-of-view of about 1.5 degrees.
The results showed that there does exist an appreciable population of debris near these altitudes.
Further debris surveys are justified.
The existing and planned optical capabilities for optical observation of debris are summarized in table 1 below:

1.2 Space-based measurements
1.2.1 Retrieved surfaces and impact detectors
Information on submillimetre-size particles can be gained with the analysis, after return to Earth, of surfaces or spacecraft exposed to the space environment.
Similar information can also be obtained through dedicated debris and dust detectors.
All of them contain, as a key element, a detection surface.
Some of them are designed to catch an impact particle for further analysis.
For cost reasons, surfaces are retrieved for later analysis only from LEO.
Examples are given in table 2. below.

After exposure to the space environment, spacecraft surfaces are covered with a large number of impacts of meteoroids and debris.
The size of individual impact craters and holes extends from micrometres to several millimetres.
A basic problem is to distinguish between impacts of meteoroids and man-made debris.
A proven method to determine their origin is chemical analysis.
However, there are some difficulties associated with this method.
Because of the high impact speed, little of the impacting material survives unaltered.
The particle vaporizes and then recondenses on the surrounding surfaces.
In many cases the origin of an impacting particle cannot be uniquely determined (lack of residue or chemical analysis not conclusive).
In order to relate the size of the impact feature with the size of the particle, ground-calibration tests (hypervelocity impact tests) have been performed for different materials.
From impact statistics and calibration experiments, the flux for meteoroids and debris can be determined as a function of particle size.
An important issue to be considered is that of secondary impacts.
If these are not properly treated, the derived flux figures will be overestimated.
LDEF was covered by more than 30,000 craters visible to the naked eye, of which 5,000 had a diameter larger than 0.5 millimetre.
The largest crater of 5 millimetres in diameter was probably caused by a 1 millimetre particle.
The LDEF showed that some impacts were clustered in time, and it also points to the existence of a submillimetre population in elliptical orbits.
On EURECA the largest impact crater diameter was 6.4 millimetres.
Among the retrieved surfaces, the returned solar array of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had been the one with the highest orbit altitude.
An interesting finding was that the impact flux for HST was considerably higher (factor 2-8) than for EURECA for crater pit sizes larger than 200-300 microns.
The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) launched in March 1995 was retrieved by the Space Shuttle in January 1996.
A planned post-flight analysis (PFA) is expected.
In general, observed flux figures agree roughly with model predictions.
The cases discussed above give evidence of the effect of the particulate environment on spacecraft in orbit.
In all cases no functional degradation of the spacecraft was observed.
Available information on the submillimetre population is limited to altitudes below 600 kilometres.
In particular, no information is available in the regions of highest density of space debris in LEO (at an altitude of about 800-1000 kilometres) as well as in the geostationary orbit.
However, ESA will place a debris and dust detector in the geostationary orbit.
1.2.2 Radar and optical measurements from space
Space-based measurements in general have the advantage of higher resolution because of the smaller distance between the observer and object.
Also, there is no disturbing effect of the atmosphere (extinction and absorption of electromagnetic signals).
Obviously, costs of space-based systems are in general higher than those on ground, and careful cost-performance trade-offs are needed.
1.2.3 Infrared measurements from space
The infrared astronomical satellite IRAS, launched in 1983 to perform a sky survey at wavelengths ranging from 8 to 120 micrometres, was operational during the 10 months in a sun synchronous orbit near an altitude of 900 kilometres.
The satellite was pointing radially away from Earth and scanning the celestial sphere.
The complete set of unprocessed IRAS data has been analysed by the Space Research Organization of the Netherlands (SRON), Groningen, in order to characterize the infrared emission of debris objects and to extract a comprehensive set of debris sightings.
The method of identifying space debris signatures is based on the recognition of their track over the IRAS focal plane.
The 200,000 potential debris sightings are stored in a database.
About 10,000 sightings are attributed to real objects.
From the debris sightings, it is not possible to compute the orbital elements of a debris object in a unique manner.
1.3 Cataloguing and databases
A catalogue is a deterministic record of the characteristics of the orbital population that have been derived from measurements or records.
The purposes of a catalogue are to provide correlation with observations of orbiting objects; to act as a historical record of orbital activity for the purposes of environment monitoring; to serve as an input to modelling the behaviour of orbiting objects; and to provide a basis for predicting future launch and operational activity.
The following characteristics of orbiting objects are recorded:
(a) Mass: the launch mass, beginning of life mass and dry mass (end of life);
(b) Radar cross-section: the returned signature of an orbiting object from which shape, orientation and size can be derived;
(c) Albedo: a measure of the reflectivity of an object which characterizes the optical visibility of an object;
(d) Dimensions;
(e) Orientation;
(f) Ballistic coefficient: a measure of the aerodynamic and mass-geometric characteristics of the object which will influence the orbital lifetime of an object until its entry into the upper atmosphere;
(g) Material construction: although not currently of importance, to effectively represent shedding of micro-debris would require the definition of surface characteristics;
(h) State vectors: the characteristics of the orbit of an object derived at a particular instant in time;
(i) Launch characteristics: this will include the launch vehicle, launch date and launch site.
There are two catalogues of space objects which are frequently updated by observations: the United States Space Command catalogue; and the Russian Federation space object catalogue.
The data from these two catalogues are archived in the DISCOS database of ESA, which also contains other relevant information.
NASDA is also studying the possibility of a debris database, as well as the provision of data to the international debris database discussed at IADC, and prediction of time and location of the re-entry of debris objects and the Collision Avoidance analysis for new launches.
NASDA currently depends on the United States Space Command orbital element data as its source-of-debris database.
NASDA will add the orbital data of debris acquired through its own experiments and satellites to that data.
A catalogue record can be stored through a number of media.
A hard copy (paper) format is not well suited to the dynamic nature of the orbital population.
An electronic format is well suited to the recording of such information; modification and updating of characteristics; manipulation of data for the purposes of comparison and input to models; and global access via networks by global users for the purposes of interrogation and contribution.
1.4 Effects of the space debris environment on the operation of space systems
Four factors determine how the space debris environment affects space systems operations.
These are time in orbit, projected area, orbital altitude and orbital inclination.
Of these, time in orbit, projected area and orbital altitude are the dominant factors.
1.4.1 Effects of large debris objects on the operation of space systems
Large debris objects are typically defined as objects larger than 10 centimetres in size.
Such objects are capable of being tracked, and orbital elements are maintained.
During the course of shuttle missions, orbiters have been required to execute collision avoidance manoeuvres in order to avoid catastrophic collisions with these large debris objects.
1.4.2 Effects of small debris objects on the operation of space systems
To date, small debris objects (smaller than a few millimetres in diameter) have caused damage to operational space systems.
This damage can be divided into two categories.
The first category is damage to surfaces or subsystems.
The second category is the effect on operations.
1.4.2.1 Damage to surface or subsystems
Examples of damage that affect the surface of operational systems are:
(a) Damage to shuttle windows;
(b) Damage to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) high gain antenna;
(c) Severing of the Small Expendable Deployer System - 2 (SEDS-2) tether;
(d) Damage to other exposed shuttle surfaces.
1.4.2.2 Effects of space debris on manned space operations
In order to protect crews from debris during flight, operational procedures have been adopted.
In the case of the space shuttle, the orbiter is oriented during flight with the tail pointed in the direction of the velocity vector.
This flight orientation was adopted to protect the crew and sensitive orbiter systems from damage caused by collisions with small debris.
Operational restrictions have also been adopted for extravehicular activities (EVAs).
Whenever possible, EVAs are conducted in such a way as to ensure that the EVA crew is shielded from debris by the orbiter.
The following sections are to be completed at the next two sessions of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee:
2. Modelling of space debris environment and risk assessment
2.1 Methods of modelling of the debris environment

3.2.2 Collision avoidance
3.3 Effectiveness of mitigation measures
C. General views
Some delegations expressed the view that every user of the geostationary orbit should plan to remove its space object from the orbit after its work was completed, and thereby eliminate a source of danger to other users of outer space.
The view was expressed that an international centre could be established with the aim of providing information and advance warning on explosions in space, fragmentation of space objects and possible collision of space objects with space debris.
In this regard, that delegation also expressed the view that international cooperation should be encouraged, with regard to the exchange of catalogues of space objects, the computation of dangerous encounters of catalogued objects with spacecraft and the observation of objects in the GSO.
That delegation also believed that a uniform database from existing catalogues and a universal format for data exchange should be established.
Some delegations were of the view that the Legal Subcommittee should be informed of the discussions in the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee under the agenda item on space debris.
The view was also expressed that a set of international rules for the launch of spacecraft should be codified, based on current practices of space agencies, in order to reduce the growth of orbital debris.
Other delegations expressed the view that it would not be appropriate to discuss the issue of space debris in the Legal Subcommittee or to develop recommendations in the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee to underpin new legal norms for orbital debris in view of the many technical issues that still need to be discussed by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
The view was expressed that the Subcommittee should establish a working group to discuss space debris, and that it was important for the Subcommittee to have a common understanding of the term "space debris".
In this regard, the view was expressed that the definition proposed at the previous session of the Subcommittee (A/AC.105/605, para. 95) could be modified to include the words "whether their owners can be identified or not" after the words "including their fragments and parts" so that the definition would now read as follows: Space debris are all man-made objects, including their fragments and parts, whether their owners can be identified or not, in Earth orbit or re-entering the dense layers of the atmosphere that are non-functional with no reasonable expectation of their being able to assume or resume their intended functions or any other functions for which they are or can be authorized.
The view was expressed that further specification in the definition of space debris would deserve expert consideration at the next session of the subcommittee.
The Subcommittee recommended that the item be retained on its agenda as a priority item for its next session.
VI. QUESTIONS RELATING TO SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND
THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE ACTIVITIES IN SPACE
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item relating to space transportation systems.
In the course of the discussion, delegations reviewed national and international cooperative programmes in space transportation systems, including expendable launchers, reusable space shuttles and space stations.
In particular, the Committee noted that China was continuing the use and development of its Long March series of launch vehicles; that India was continuing development of the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle and had succeeded in the developmental launch of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle; that Japan had introduced into service its H-II launch vehicle, had successfully launched the J-1 launch vehicle and was continuing its development of the H-IIA and M-V launch vehicles; that the Russian Federation had launched space objects of various types using expendable launchers of the Soyuz, Cosmos, Proton and other series and had sent a number of national and international crews to the Mir space station; that Ukraine, in cooperation with the Russian Federation, was continuing to produce and successfully use the Tsyklon and Zenit rocket launchers, as well as offering them for use in international cooperative activities; that the United Kingdom was cooperating with ESA in its Future European Space Transportation Investigation Programme (FESTIP); that the United States was continuing its programme of expendable launches and flights of the reusable Space Shuttle, many of the flights involving significant international participation; that Canada, Japan, Russian Federation, United States and ESA were continuing preparations on the International Space Station programme; and that ESA was continuing development of the Ariane series of launch vehicles.
The Subcommittee took note of developments in the United States commercial launch industry, including the Atlas, Delta and Pegasus expendable vehicles, and the Reusable Launch Vehicle technology programme that included the X-33 experimental launch vehicle.
In that connection, the Subcommittee noted that the results of that programme would be used to assess the feasibility and affordability of a new generation of reusable launch systems.
The Subcommittee also took note of the Automatic Landing Flight Experiment (ALFLEX) and study of the HOPE-X experimental unmanned winged vehicle of Japan.
The Subcommittee took note of developments in the Russian Federation, including the improved Proton-M launcher, the ecologically clean Rus and Angara launchers and the airborne launched systems, Burlak and Aerokosmos.
The Subcommittee also took note of the introduction into the space transportation system of the Russian Federation of the Start-1, Start and Rokot launchers that were based on converted ballistic missiles.
The Subcommittee further noted that in addition to the Plesetsk cosmodrome that had seen almost 1,500 launches during the previous 30 years, there were plans for the construction of a new cosmodrome called Svobodny in the eastern part of the country.
The Subcommittee stressed the importance of international cooperation in space transportation in order to provide all countries with access to the benefits of space science and technology.
The Subcommittee was informed of the concept of the X-Prize, a prize that would promote private industry development of a reusable, single-stage, sub-orbital vehicle capable of carrying three persons (300 kilograms) to an altitude of at least 100 kilometres above Earth, and which would stimulate public interest in space exploration and development and lead to the capability to fly many people into space, as reflected in the resolution adopted unanimously by ASE.
The view was expressed that the United Nations should undertake a study to determine the feasibility of it becoming the organization responsible for administering the launching, placement into orbit and utilization of satellites for educational and investigative institutions.
The Subcommittee recommended that consideration of the item be continued at its next session.
VII. EXAMINATION OF THE PHYSICAL NATURE AND TECHNICAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT; EXAMINATION OF ITS UTILIZATION AND
APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING, INTER ALIA, IN THE FIELD OF SPACE
COMMUNICATIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER QUESTIONS RELATING TO SPACE COMMUNICATIONS DEVELOPMENTS, TAKING
PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE NEEDS AND
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item relating to the geostationary orbit and space communications.
In the course of the discussion, delegations reviewed national and international cooperative programmes in satellite communications, including progress in communications satellite technology that would make satellite communications more accessible and less expensive and increase the communications capacity of the geostationary orbit and the electromagnetic spectrum.
The Subcommittee took note of the growing use of communications satellite systems for telecommunications, television broadcasting, data networks, environmental data relay, mobile communications, disaster warning and relief, telemedicine and other communications functions.
Some delegations expressed the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource and that saturation should be avoided in order to ensure that all countries had non-discriminatory access to the orbit.
Those delegations felt that a special sui generis legal regime was required to ensure equitable access by all States, particularly developing countries.
They felt that the role of ITU, which concerned the technical aspects, and of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space with respect to the geostationary orbit were complementary.
Other delegations expressed the view that questions relating to the geostationary orbit were being addressed effectively by ITU.
The view was expressed that in considering the question of equitable access, account should be taken in particular of the geographic situation of the equatorial countries.
The view was also expressed that a geostationary satellite, like all other satellites, was attracted by the entire body of the Earth and that, therefore, it could not be said that the phenomenon of a geostationary satellite was linked to gravitational phenomena produced uniquely in the plane of the terrestrial equator.
The view was expressed that the Subcommittee could undertake a technical study on alternatives for determining and assigning orbits in the geostationary and other orbits, not only for communications purposes, and that one such alternative could be binding the geostationary orbit to an international trust fund that would have all Member States of the United Nations as beneficiaries.
Some delegations noted that the use of the geostationary orbit, like other orbits, was affected by the problem of space debris and that efforts were needed to minimize the generation of debris in the orbit and to move satellites shortly before the end of their useful lives into disposal orbits beyond the geostationary orbit.
The Subcommittee recommended that consideration of the item relating to the geostationary orbit and space communications be continued at its next session.
VIII. PROGRESS IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE ACTIVITIES
RELATED TO THE EARTH ENVIRONMENT, IN PARTICULAR PROGRESS IN THE GEOSPHERE-BIOSPHERE (GLOBAL CHANGE) PROGRAMME
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item concerning progress in national and international space activities related to the Earth environment, in particular progress in the Global Change Programme.
The Subcommittee noted the progress being made through international cooperation in the Global Change Programme, with the participation of many countries.
It noted that such a joint international effort was of fundamental importance for examining the future habitability of the planet and for managing the common natural resources of the Earth.
The Subcommittee took particular note of the need to involve as many countries as possible in the scientific activities of the Programme, both in developed and in developing countries.
The Subcommittee took note of the important contributions of satellite remote sensing for environmental monitoring, for planning sustainable development, for water-resource development, for monitoring crop conditions, and for predicting and assessing drought.
The Subcommittee also noted the progress made in India in the field of climate modelling, monsoon dynamics, atmospheric chemistry and radiation, and land, air and ocean interaction.
The Subcommittee noted the important contribution of meteorological and atmospheric research satellites for studying global climate change, the greenhouse effect, the degradation of the ozone layer and other global environmental processes.
The previously launched Topex/Poseidon oceanographic satellite, Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, CRISTA-SPAS, SAR, Third Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS-3), Total Ozone Mapping System, RADARSAT, Earth Resources Satellite 1 and 2, Marine Observation Satellite (MOS), the IRS series of satellites, and Sich 1 satellite were important tools for that purpose, as would be the planned Phase II Mission to Planet Earth, Earth Observing System (EOS) series of spacecraft, TRMM, Envisat, ADEOS, Meteor, Meteosat and other similar spacecraft.
The Subcommittee noted the need for further space research relating to climate change, weather patterns, vegetation distribution, storm and flood risk, and other environmental factors.

It recommended that other States consider participating in such cooperative activities.
IX. MATTERS RELATING TO LIFE SCIENCES, INCLUDING SPACE MEDICINE
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item relating to life sciences.
The Subcommittee recalled that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, had considered it particularly important that all countries should have the opportunity to use the techniques resulting from medical studies in space.
The Subcommittee noted that studies of human and animal physiology under the microgravity conditions of space flight had led to important advances in medical knowledge in such areas as blood circulation, sensory perception, immunology and the effects of cosmic radiation.
It noted that important new information in those fields had been obtained through experiments on the Mir space station, particularly during the joint ESA-Russian Federation long-duration EUROMIR '95 mission, during the first long-duration flight of a woman cosmonaut, during the first flight of a United States astronaut aboard the Mir space station and during two docking missions of the United States Space Shuttle with the Mir space station.
Important data were gathered during several United States Space Shuttle missions, in particular during the Second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission.
Other important data were also gathered from biological experiments on the sounding rocket MAXUS and the newly equipped DC-9 microgravity research aircraft.
The Subcommittee took note of forthcoming flights of the Space Shuttle with Canadian national life sciences payloads, as well as two Canadian astronauts among its crews, of preparations for the first Chilean biomedical experiment on the Space Shuttle and of a bilateral German-Russian cooperation project, MIR '96, which would take advantage of this long-duration manned mission for experiments focusing on human physiology, materials sciences and technology.
It also noted the French-German cooperation in the development of a diagnostic facility for cardiovascular research in space, CARDIOLAB, to be used on the International Space Station, and the development by the space agencies of Bulgaria, Germany and the Russian Federation of a new generation of medical measuring equipment, NEUROLAB, as well as the Bulgarian automatic biotechnological system SVET.
The Subcommittee noted that applications of space technologies were demonstrating growing promise in medicine and public health on Earth.
In that connection, the Subcommittee noted that specialists from Portugal had studied a new “vibration disease” that occurred after prolonged stays in specific industrial, aeronautical and spatial environments.
The Subcommittee also noted that products of space biotechnology, such as pharmaceutical and medical instruments, could contribute to improved health care.
The Subcommittee noted the importance of space technology for those purposes and encouraged further research and exchange of information on those applications.
The Subcommittee noted that space studies in life sciences and medicine had important potential benefits for all countries and that efforts should be made to promote international cooperation to enable all countries to benefit from those advances.
X. MATTERS RELATING TO PLANETARY EXPLORATION AND MATTERS
RELATING TO ASTRONOMY In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee continued its consideration of the item on planetary exploration and the item on astronomy.
The Subcommittee noted that several planetary exploration missions were currently under way.
The Galileo spacecraft successfully entered into orbit around Jupiter and sent its instrumented probe into the atmosphere of Jupiter.
The ESA Ulysses spacecraft, following its swing-by trajectory from Jupiter, was studying the solar polar regions that had not been previously investigated.
The Subcommittee noted missions planned for future launch, including Mars 96, Planet B, Mars Surveyor, Orbiter and Pathfinder, for investigation of Mars; Lunar Prospector for lunar exploration; Cassini/Huygens, for investigation of Saturn and its moons; and the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), Stardust and Rosetta missions to asteroids and comets.
The Subcommittee noted the high degree of international cooperation in all of those investigations, and stressed the need to further enhance international cooperation in planetary exploration to enable all countries to benefit from and participate in those activities.
The Subcommittee noted that the use of spacecraft for making astronomical observations from above the atmosphere had greatly advanced knowledge of the universe by allowing observations in all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It noted that with the repaired Hubble Space Telescope, Stretched Rohini Scientific Satellite (SROSS C-2), Rosat, Granat and Roentgen-Kvant X-ray observatories, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer, Astro-D, Freja, Koronas I and Wind satellites, and with data from the recent Interball, Infrared Space Observatory, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and X-Ray Timing Explorer, as well as the Spartan series of subsatellites, astronomers had powerful tools for their investigations of the universe.
The planned launches of the four Cluster satellites, Radioastron satellite, Spektr-Roentgen-Gamma observatory, ASTRO-SPAS subsatellites, Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, Space Infrared Telescope Facility, Spektr-UV, International Gamma Ray Astronomy Laboratory (INTEGRAL), Scientific Applications Satellite (SAC-B), Very Long Base Interferometry Space Observatory, X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM), Gamma 1 and 400, Ikon, Relikt 3 and many others would open up further realms of the universe to detailed observation.
The Subcommittee also took note of ground-based astronomical observations, in particular those by the new radiotelescope built in Turkey in cooperation with Ukraine.
The Subcommittee noted with satisfaction that all of those projects were open to broad international cooperation.
The Subcommittee heard a special presentation of the report on the international conference on near-Earth objects, and a presentation by IAU on solar reflectors, radio astronomy and access to the sky, as described in paragraph 19 of the present report.
The Subcommittee recommended that consideration of the items be continued at its next session.
XI. THE THEME FIXED FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION AT THE 1996 SESSION:
UTILIZATION OF MICRO- AND SMALL SATELLITES FOR THE EXPANSION OF LOW-COST SPACE ACTIVITIES,
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, the Subcommittee paid special attention to the theme “Utilization of micro- and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost space activities, taking into account the special needs of developing countries”.
The Subcommittee noted with satisfaction that, at its invitation, COSPAR and IAF had organized a symposium on the theme on 12 and 13 February 1996, as described in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the present report.
The Subcommittee also heard special presentations on the special theme by Poland and the Russian Federation as described in paragraph 19 of the present report.
The Subcommittee took note of the fact that as a consequence of the evolution of space-related technologies, in particular microelectronics, power generation and storage, as well as in propulsion technology, micro- and small satellites could make significant space capabilities accessible to a wide range of users, including students in secondary schools and universities and engineers and scientists in many countries.
It was also noted that small satellite projects are ideal for extensive international cooperation, as relatively sophisticated scientific and technological experiments as well as application missions could be flown in space at modest costs.
In this regard, the Subcommittee noted particular application areas including space physics, astronomy, astrophysics, technology demonstrations, communications and data relay experiments, and acquisition of Earth resource data, including disaster-related information.
The Subcommittee also noted that small satellites represent an excellent method for training students, engineers and scientists in different disciplines, including engineering, software development for on-board and ground computers and management of sophisticated technical programmes.
Among the main difficulties in promoting the use of small satellite technology for developing countries, the Subcommittee noted a low awareness of policy-making officials and the general public of the importance and benefits of a national space programme, as well as a lack of adequately trained local personnel.
On the basis of the results of its deliberations on this special theme as well as the recommendations contained in the technical study on microsatellites and small satellites (A/AC.105/611), the Subcommittee recommended that more of the activities of the Programme on Space Applications should be devoted to this theme.
XII. OTHER MATTERS
A. Third UNISPACE conference
The Subcommittee noted that the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, paragraph 32, had agreed that a Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space could be convened before the turn of the present century, and that, prior to recommending a date for the Conference, there should be a consensus recommendation on the agenda, venue and funding of the Conference.

Annex II
REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP OF THE WHOLE TO EVALUATE THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SECOND PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE ON THE WORK OF ITS TENTH SESSION
The Working Group of the Whole to Evaluate the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82) was re-established for its tenth session by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/27, paragraph 19, of 6 December 1995, with a view to improving the execution of activities relating to international cooperation, particularly those included in the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, and to proposing concrete steps to increase such cooperation as well as to make it more efficient.
The Working Group held a series of meetings from 14 to 22 February 1996, during the thirty-third session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
At its meeting on 22 February 1996, the Working Group adopted the present report.
Mr. Muhammad Nasim Shah (Pakistan) was elected Chairman of the Working Group.
The Chairman, in his opening statement, reviewed the mandate of the Working Group for its tenth session and the status of the implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
In accordance with resolution 50/27, paragraph 19, the Working Group of the Whole continued its assessment of the implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
The Working Group had before it a number of studies and reports prepared by the Secretariat, Member States and international organizations, contained in documents A/AC.105/614, Add.1, 2 and 3, and A/AC.105/625.
The Working Group of the Whole also had before it two technical studies prepared by the Secretariat, one on micro- and small satellites: current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation (A/AC.105/611), and one on the use of remote sensing technologies for environmental applications, particularly in support of the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (A/AC.105/632).
The Working Group noted that the Secretariat was also in the process of preparing additional technical studies on some of the subjects it had suggested at its thirty-first session, as outlined in document A/AC.105/571, annex II, paragraph 17, namely on the following subjects:
(a) Space applications for sustainable development;
(b) Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation;
(c) Basic space science in developing countries.
The Working Group noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts of the United Nations, Member States and other international organizations to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
The Working Group agreed on the following conclusions and recommendations, keeping in view the priorities contained in General Assembly resolution 50/27, paragraph 17.
I. SHORT-TERM TRAINING AND LONG-TERM EDUCATION
The Working Group noted with appreciation that training courses and workshops in remote sensing, satellite communications and other topics have been organized for the benefit of developing countries with the assistance of the United Nations.
Such courses and workshops on advanced applications of space science and technology and on new technological developments should continue to be organized regularly.
At the same time, the recent advances in space technologies and applications for development should be brought to the attention of planners, administrators and decision makers in the developing countries. Member States, particularly the developed countries, and international organizations are requested to support the training programme on an ongoing basis.
II. INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION
The Working Group noted with appreciation the reports prepared by the Office for Outer Space Affairs on the resources and technological capabilities of States in space activities as well as in the areas of education, training, research and fellowship opportunities for the promotion of cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.
Those reports should continue to be periodically updated by the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The Working Group recommended that in the light of the continued development of space activities, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space should request all States, particularly those with major space or space-related capabilities, to continue to inform the Secretary-General annually, as appropriate, about those space activities that were or could be the subject of greater international cooperation, with particular emphasis on the needs of the developing countries.
Similarly, the Committee should also request international organizations with space-related activities to continue to inform the Secretary-General annually concerning those space activities that were or could be the subject of greater international cooperation, with particular emphasis on the needs of the developing countries.
III. INFORMATION, STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ADVISORY SERVICES
The Working Group appreciated the preparation by the Secretariat of the studies and reports on space science, technology and its applications referred to in paragraph 3.
The Working Group recommended that further studies should be undertaken by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, in view of the recommendations made by participants at workshops, training courses, conferences and symposia organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
With emphasis on the needs of developing countries, those studies could address the following subject areas:
(a) Space technology applications for preventing and mitigating the effects of natural disasters;
(b) Use of new technologies in communications and information networks.
In order to promote the development of national space programmes, including higher education in space-related subjects, the United Nations should continue to arrange, upon request, for the provision of expert consultants from developed and developing countries to assist in the preparation of integrated national plans of action for initiating, strengthening or reorienting appropriate space applications programmes, which should be in conformity with other national development programmes.
IV. OTHER MATTERS
A. Priority areas
The Working Group considered that, in order to further promote the applications of space science and technology for development, priority should be given to the following areas:
(a) Stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries.
UNISPACE 82 recommended the free exchange of scientific and technological information and an arrangement for the transfer of technologies to promote the use and development of space technology in the developing countries.
UNISPACE 82 also recommended that countries should not place undue restrictions on the sale of components, subsystems or systems required for peaceful space applications.
A greater international understanding therefore needs to be evolved to overcome the difficulties faced by the developing countries in this respect;
(b) Promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications.
UNISPACE 82 recommended appropriate assistance and called particularly upon international financial agencies to support demonstration projects to provide opportunities for hands-on experience in space technology and applications for the developing countries through direct involvement in such applications projects or pilot projects;
(c) United Nations funding.
The Programme on Space Applications should be given the full support of the United Nations in order to fully implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82.
That recommendation was made on the understanding that the Office for Outer Space Affairs would give priority to the full implementation of the Programme on Space Applications within the available resources of its regular budget;
(d) Voluntary contributions.
Appreciation was expressed for the support of Member States and international organizations in the form of cash and in-kind contributions for the activities being undertaken by the Programme on Space Applications for the implementation of the UNISCPACE 82 recommendations.
Those Member States and international organizations were requested to continue their support and other Member States and international organizations were urged to provide cash and in-kind contributions for Programme activities, in particular those that are not implemented due to a lack of financing.
B. Third UNISPACE Introduction
The Working Group of the Whole noted that, as reflected in General Assembly resolution 50/27, paragraph 31, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, at its thirty-second session, had continued its discussions on the possibility of holding a third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and that the Committee continued the discussions at its thirty-eighth session with a view to promoting an early conclusion on the matter by the Committee.
The General Assembly, in paragraph 32 of its resolution 50/27, agreed that a third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space could be convened before the turn of the present century, and that, prior to recommending a date for the conference, there should be a consensus recommendation on the agenda, venue and funding of the conference.
The General Assembly, in paragraph 33 of its resolution 50/27, recommended that the Subcommittee, at its thirty-third session, should continue the work it had conducted at its thirty-second session, taking into particular account the report of its Working Group of the Whole (A/AC.105/605, annex II), with the aim being to complete the development and refinement of a framework that would allow an evaluation of proposals by the Committee at its thirty-ninth session, and that that framework should allow for the consideration of all possibilities of achieving the final objectives of such a conference.
In paragraph 34 of that resolution, the General Assembly agreed that on the basis of the work to be conducted by the thirty-third session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, the Committee, at its thirty-ninth session, should consider all issues related to the possible convening of a third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, including its technical and political objectives, a detailed and sharply focused agenda, funding, timing and other organizational aspects as well as whether the objectives of the conference could be achieved by other means, with a view to making a final recommendation to the General Assembly at that session of the Committee.
The text of the following paragraphs is based on the work done by the Working Group of the Whole at its ninth session, as reflected in its report (A/AC.105/605, annex II) and includes additional ideas expressed during the tenth session of the Working Group of the Whole.
The Working Group of the Whole also had the benefit of the views expressed by Member States during the thirty-third session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
1. The objectives of the conference
The basic objective of the proposed third UNISPACE conference would be to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and to strengthen the capabilities of Member States, in particular developing countries, to use the applications of space research for economic, social and cultural development.
As a way of achieving this primary objective, the proposed conference should include a review of the recent developments in space activities, including advances in space technology, new economic and social applications, and economic factors limiting the development of space technology and its applications.
On the basis of that review, a third UNISPACE conference would consider how States can make the best use of existing systems and opportunities and how international cooperation should be strengthened, where necessary, to provide new systems, applications and further opportunities for international cooperation for the general benefit of Member States.
In particular, a third UNISPACE conference could consider, inter alia, how international cooperation in the field of remote sensing, weather and climate observations and environmental monitoring could be strengthened to promote the use of such systems by all States.
Together with the ways of achieving the primary objective, another objective or desirable result would be that developing countries would define their needs for space applications for development purposes in advance of any conference.
At the same time, the conference would analyse the relationships between commercialization of space technology, national development plans and the building of indigenous capabilities with a view to further encouraging the partnership of the developing countries in the development and utilization of these technologies.
Another objective would be to consider ways of expediting the use of space applications in Member States to promote sustainable development, particularly through the implementation of the recommendations of Agenda 21 of UNCED as well as their participation in international programmes such as “Mission to Planet Earth” and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme or in various applications of satellite communications for commercial, educational or health purposes.
A third UNISPACE conference could address the various issues related to education, training and technical assistance in space science and technology and their applications aimed at the development of indigenous capabilities in all States to ensure that all can, in practice as well as in principle, use data from space systems.
The conference could serve as a valuable forum for increasing awareness of the general public regarding the benefits of space technology and critical evaluation of the value of space activities.
2. Organization of the conference
The organization of the Conference should permit the participation of all States Members of the United Nations, including those who are not members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
Such a conference would require thorough preparation, and therefore the holding of such a conference in 1996 or 1997 is unrealistic.
In addition, the resource requirements of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the Programme could be effectively oriented towards conference preparations during the 18-month period prior to the conference.
Such considerations should be taken into account in setting the date for the conference.
In addition, the overall programme of major United Nations conferences should be taken into account in recommending a date in order to ensure that the financial burden is manageable within the scope of the overall United Nations budget.
The Working Group of the Whole noted that the Committee, at its thirty-eighth session, had agreed that at an appropriate time, following agreement on the holding of a conference, IAF, COSPAR, IAU and ISPRS, as well as other relevant organizations should be asked to prepare background documents.
Those organizations could also be invited to organize, in cooperation with the host country, a UNISPACE forum to be held as part of the conference.
Recalling that space technology has an important role to play in economic and social development such as in implementing the recommendations of UNCED and Agenda 21, and that many countries which are not members of the Committee are or could be utilizing space technology for this and other purposes, the Working Group of the Whole agreed that a global conference on space, organized by the United Nations, could be an appropriate forum in which to discuss issues related to international cooperation, space policies, the participation of the private sector and implementation or follow-up actions relating to these questions as well as to other issues that might be of universal concern.
The Working Group of the Whole was of the view that the objectives indicated for a third UNISPACE conference could be better achieved if it examined space activity and international cooperation in this area as a whole and if during its preparatory phase, the forums provided by specialized groups and other regional or international conferences, symposia and meetings are utilized to define a few focused themes to be dealt with by a third UNISPACE conference.
In considering the convening of a third UNISPACE conference, the Committee should work with and involve major organizations in the above fields.
These specialized groups may well be the best or most appropriate route to achieving the results required.
Involving a group with a mandate in a specific field of space from the beginning, setting targets for it and asking it to report regularly on its progress is better than having all the recommended actions tied to a United Nations committee with limited resources.
In addition, it would be desirable to identify mechanisms for input to and feedback from major funding organizations to pull through any resulting actions.
The Conference could complement consideration of issues posed due to limited participation or focus of any of the specialized groups.
The Working Group agreed that the proposals it had made in 1995 (A/AC.105/605, annex II, paragraphs 13 through 59), the proposal made by the Group of 77 countries members of the Subcommittee in 1996 (see appendix I), the additional ideas put forward by the Czech Republic in 1996 on the holding of a UNISPACE III conference (see appendix II) and the proposal made by the United Kingdom in 1996, contained in the paper "Other means" (see appendix III), by which any objectives set for a conference could be addressed in other ways, contributed to the framework which would facilitate the work of the Committee in making a final recommendation on this matter, at its thirty-ninth session, to the General Assembly.
In addition to the proposals and the possibilities for other means, the Working Group of the Whole reached an understanding that if a conference (typically referred to as UNISPACE III) were to be convened, then the following could apply:
(a) The conference should ensure the participation of all countries, including those which are not members of the Committee;
(b) Any conference and the related preparatory procedures would allow the issues related to international cooperation on the development and utilization of space science and technology to be explored; in particular, this would allow the evaluation of the major development areas where space could make a substantive and cost-efficient contribution;
(c) Any conference would not be a simple repetition of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), as space activities had significantly advanced since that time, and many of the issues covered at that time were now being achieved by other means;
(d) There are now a significant number of conferences and training courses each year on space, which are run on a world-wide basis with many such events specifically oriented to the needs of developing countries.
Any United Nations event would therefore not aim at duplicating or replacing such regular and ongoing events. Such United Nations events might include the possibility of holding topical meetings organized under the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, in cooperation with relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations and international scientific organizations;
(e) Regional conferences or events could be convened to discuss matters of particular relevance or concern to the region, and any conclusions of such events could be passed on to the United Nations conference (or event) or the Committee, for consideration as appropriate;
(f) Any conference would draw on the available resources, infrastructure, facilities and services of the Committee and its subcommittees;
(g) The outline of an agenda for any conference will be detailed following agreement on the holding of a third UNISPACE or other appropriate event.
The Working Group of the Whole noted that, through intensification of its work, the Committee could address several of the items which would result from an agenda based on some of the objectives that have been indicated.
The Committee could also invite experts in relevant fields to make presentations to it and to prepare working documents to be reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee could also invite contributions, to be presented at its sessions, from a number of groups that specialize in a field of space science or technology to review recent scientific and technological developments.
The Working Group of the Whole noted that groups such as the Space Agency Forum, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, the International Astronautical Federation, the Committee on Space Research and the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and other such regional or international groups could provide the Committee with a valuable view of the current status and the expected developments in their respective fields.
The Working Group of the Whole also noted that some elements to be pursued in fulfilling the objectives of a possible third UNISPACE conference could be addressed in regular or ad hoc meetings of the groups referred to above as well as in regional or international conferences, symposia or meetings that address a range of themes and applications.
The Committee, in considering the preparations for a possible third UNISPACE conference, should provide appropriate endorsement for the regular activities of these other bodies in dealing with matters of relevance to the Committee.
Specialized groups, such as those referred to above, should be invited to participate in preparing realistic goals so that a possible third UNISPACE conference complements and adds to the activities of these other bodies.
The Committee would also request those bodies to assist in reaching achievable plans for follow-up actions that fall within their mandates.
4. Additional ideas for consideration
Some delegations considered that the current proposals for a conference are inappropriate at the present time, given the general budgetary constraints of the United Nations and its Member States.
Some delegations observed that the agenda and the objectives of the conference proposed by the Group of 77 were too broad and diffused to ensure an action-oriented outcome of the conference.
Those delegations emphasized the need to sharply focus on a limited number of issues on which concrete agreements would be reached to promote practical international cooperation.
When such issues are identified, it would be necessary to make an alternative arrangement for the proposed United Nations conference which would specifically achieve the objective of the event.
Other delegations were of the firm view that the proposals made by the Group of 77 in their Paper, submitted to the Working Group of the Whole in February 1996, provide options for alternative financial measures that could allow the holding of a third UNISPACE conference, in pursuance of the objectives identified by the Working Group of the Whole, which are indeed well focused.
It was however pointed out that the defrayal of any additional financial obligations resulting therefrom would not constitute an alternative financial measure.
Some delegations considered that an appropriate meeting of the Committee (or of one of its subcommittees) could be held in conjunction with a World Space Exposition; the aim would be to display programmes, applications, technology and solutions generally made possible by space science and technology.
This should help catalyse appropriate forms of coordination, collaboration and communication on space, promote the universal application and utilization of space science, and assist in demonstrating the need for continuity and complementarity of data in applications of space technology.
Other delegations were of the view that such a meeting still falls short of the goals of the conference ensuring participation of all States.
Some delegations proposed to hold an ad hoc special session of the Committee open to all States with a focus on technical cooperation for the application of space science and technology to development provided that during the year of such an event, there would be no regular sessions of the Committee and its subcommittees, except for the meetings of the preparatory committee for the ad hoc special session of the Committee.
Other delegations were of the view that the agenda for such a session should meet the needs of all States and that ensuring participation at a higher level of policy- and decision makers is essential to any scheme of such a meeting.
Some delegations proposed that the third UNISPACE conference could appropriately be convened in 1998, before the 53rd session of the General Assembly to enable it to consider the report of that conference.
Some delegations considered that the General Assembly could devote two special plenary meetings to the implementation of a preparatory phase and an open-ended session of the Committee on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and to designate those meetings as an international conference on the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space, taking particular account of the needs of the developing countries, which should take place at an appropriate global policy-making level and in keeping with the procedures and practices of the General Assembly.
Some delegations expressed the view that a special session of the Committee, open to all Member States of the United Nations at the ministerial level could be convened, aimed at examining the ample benefits made available by space technology, taking special consideration of the needs of the developing countries.
This international conference would be preceded by two special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.
Some delegations expressed the opinion that in order to adhere to the objectives indicated in section 1 above and to ensure a tangible output at the national, regional and international levels, the conference should be universal so far as the participants are concerned and should include participation of high-level policy- and decision makers.
C. Future work
The Working Group recommended that it be reconvened next year to continue its work.Appendix I
HOLDING OF THE THIRD UNISPACE CONFERENCE
(Proposal submitted by the Group of 77 at the tenth session of the Working Group of the Whole: February 1996)
The General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27, paragraph 32, agreed that a third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space could be convened before the turn of the present century, and that, prior to recommending a date for the Conference, there should be a consensus recommendation on the agenda, venue and funding of the Conference.
The General Assembly, in paragraph 33 of the same resolution, recommended that the Subcommittee should continue the work it had conducted at its thirty-second session with the aim being to complete the development and refinement of a framework that would allow an evaluation of proposals by the Committee at its thirty-ninth session, and that this framework should allow for the consideration of all possibilities of achieving the final objectives of such a Conference.
The Group of 77 has thoroughly analysed the views that have been presented over a number of years by all members of the Subcommittee on the issue of the possible holding of a third UNIPSACE Conference, including whether the objectives of the Conference could be achieved by other means.
The following reflects the consensus views of the Group of 77 on this issue.
The essential aspects of the rationale for and objectives of a third UNISPACE Conference have been presented through working papers and statements by Member States to the Committee and its subsidiary bodies, and include the following:
(a) The Conference should ensure the participation of all countries, not only those which are members of the Committee, many of which are already making significant use of space technology in their economic and social development plans, but also those which are just beginning or planning to do so;
(b) The Conference is the only forum where high-level policy- and decision makers in the technical, political and legal areas can become sensitized to and analyse the issues related to international cooperation and to the development and utilization of space science and technology to support the major development areas where space can make a substantive and cost-efficient contribution;
(c) The Group of 77 has presented clear objectives for the Conference, and these objectives are of primary importance for the developing countries.
These objectives, together with those of other countries, can lead to a clear and sharply focused agenda for the Conference and to the expectation of a concrete and pragmatic outcome.
On other issues, such as the timing, venue and funding of the Conference, the Group of 77 has, on several occasions, indicated its willingness to find the most appropriate ways and means to hold such a Conference in the most cost-efficient and productive manner.
The Group of 77 is of the considered view that an expanded or special session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, or of the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly during its consideration of the report of COPUOS, would not adequately meet the objectives of the third UNISPACE Conference.
The Group of 77 noted that two major United Nations conferences are held annually in accordance with the normal practice of the United Nations.
Having thoroughly considered various options, in view of the foregoing, the Group of 77 proposes the following options:
(a) The third UNISPACE Conference could be scheduled as one of the two major United Nations conferences in a particular year, and it could thus be financed within the zero growth budget policy followed by the United Nations.
OR
(b) In the year of the third UNISPACE Conference, the regular meetings of the Committee and its subsidiary bodies would be scheduled, on an exceptional basis, in the following manner.
The Scientific and Technical Subcommittee would meet for one week, to be followed by a two-week session of the Legal Subcommittee.
The Main Committee would meet for one day, before the actual holding of the third UNISPACE Conference to adopt the reports of the two subcommittees.
The savings of four weeks of session-related expenses obtained in this manner would offset a large part of the United Nations costs of the Conference.
The Conference would thus have limited additional requirements, if any, for documentation, interpretation and other services.
Moreover, in accordance with the normal practice of the United Nations, if the Conference is hosted by a Member State at a venue other than at United Nations Headquarters, all additional financial obligations resulting therefrom as compared with the expenditure which would have been incurred if the Conference had been held at United Nations Headquarters would be borne by that country.
The Group of 77 is also of the view that the recommendations of the Conference would be limited in number, sharply focused, having significant impacts on the economic and social development of all countries.
Bearing in mind the above considerations, and also that the agenda of a third UNISPACE Conference should be focused, well balanced and consistent with the interests and needs of all countries, the Group of 77 has drafted a possible agenda for the third UNISPACE Conference.
This agenda, presented below, is based largely on the work done by the Working Group of the Whole at its 1995 session.

COMMITTEE ON THE PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE
Report by the Secretariat
During the thirty-third session of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) and the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) organized, in liaison with Member States, a symposium on the theme "Utilization of micro- and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost space activities, taking into account the special needs of developing countries", to complement discussions within the Subcommittee on that theme.
This symposium was organized in accordance with the recommendation of the Subcommittee at its thirty-second session (A/AC.105/605, para. 136), which was subsequently endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its thirty-eighth sessionOfficial Records of the General Assembly Fiftieth Session, Supplement No. 20 (A/50/20), para. 102.
The symposium was the twelfth to be organized by COSPAR and IAF during the annual meetings of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, the topic for each year being selected by the Subcommittee at the previous session.
The symposium was held in two parts, on 12 and 13 February 1996, following the completion of debate in the afternoon meetings of the Subcommittee during the first week of its session.
In addition to these special presentations organized by COSPAR and IAF at the request of the Subcommittee, delegations of Member States provided a number of scientific and technical presentations by specialists in space science and applications relating to various items on the agenda of the Subcommittee.
Several national and international organizations also made special presentations on their scientific and technical activities.
In order to make more widely available the information on recent developments in space science, technology and applications, presented during the symposium and the other presentations, the Secretariat has prepared a summary of that information, which is presented below.
The annex contains a more detailed description of the scientific and technical presentations made before the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session.
The annex is in English only.
A list of the presentations and the speakers is contained in the appendix to the annex.A/AC.105/638
Page I. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
Symposium on Utilization of Micro- and Small Satellites for the Expansion of Low-cost
Space Activities, taking into Account the Special Needs of Developing Countries
It was stated that, in most developing countries, at least two categories of needs for small satellites and microsatellite systems could be identified.
The first group might be classified as direct needs, related to social and economic problems that might be addressed through various applications of space technology.
The second group of needs had an indirect nature and dealt with attaining the condition of taking full advantage of the country's investments in acquisition of space systems and services.
The use of Low Earth Orbit Communications (LEOCOM) systems allowed many services; one of the most interesting was the communication between a portable terminal and a normal telephone of the existing fixed telecommunication network.
In that case, the two users might be located anywhere in the territory and particularly in remote areas or regions lacking a communications infrastructure.
The communication between two mobile users as well as between a mobile user and a user of the fixed network system anywhere around the globe was also possible.
The use of automatic data collection platforms (DCP), in conjunction with the two-way characteristics of LEOCOM, allowed for installation of a data collection network that featured a wide coverage and provided real-time service.
In addition, the LEOCOM system could provide the location of any user of mobile terminals with an accuracy in the 100 metre range.
The LEOCOM mobile terminal could also be coupled to a facsimile machine for the transmission of graphical data.
Thus, it allowed a user, for instance, to send a fax of an electrocardiogram in the case of a medical emergency in a remote area.
Telemedicine was an application that would increase efficiency of medical services by allowing the transmission of information obtained by inexpensive and simple sensors directly to complex processing units in large medical centres where it could be interpreted by specialized physicians.
That would make it possible for powerful and effective emergency services to reach poor and undeveloped areas, saving many lives and avoiding unnecessary displacement of patients.
The Healthsat project was a good example of telemedicine application that used a 60 kg microsatellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to relay medical data information between Nigeria and North America.
Mobile communication might also play an important role in cases of natural disasters, allowing help to reach the disaster victims earlier and providing logistical support to the rescue teams.
Many developing countries had had early access to the benefits of satellite remote sensing, but still had a long way to go in order to maximize the benefits of the existing capabilities.
There were, however, unique needs at both national and regional levels that demanded new solutions.
Brazil and the Republic of Korea, for instance, were already developing new satellite programmes to address their specific needs.
Developing countries in Latin America, South-East Asia and in other regions required special sensor parameters such as spectral bands, spatial resolution, time resolution, cost of image, investment level in the ground equipment, and expertise required for utilization.
Cooperative space activities were often supported by some kind of technology transfer.
A successful technology transfer in the development of the small satellite project implied a process by which a team acquired sufficient momentum to be able to produce the next generation of small satellites.
There were several mechanisms whereby technology transfer could be achieved, but to be successful, the transfer should be a transfer of knowledge, not the transfer of a technology package (know-why as well as know-how).
Examples of programmes where engineers from developing countries were trained on small satellite design, production and operations were numerous.
The University of Surrey in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had, for example, provided such assistance in the development of small satellites below 100 kg to Chile, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea, and even to small countries in Europe that decided to initiate a space programme.
A small satellite project in Argentina, Scientific Applications Satellite B (SAC-B,) was being prepared in cooperation with the United States of America (Pegasus launcher).
The main purpose of the project was to design a satellite with a scientific payload to advance the study of solar physics and astrophysics.
The mass of the satellite was about 180 kg with an expected active lifetime minimum of three years.
The launching of the satellite was scheduled for 1996.
A new generation of satellites, SAC-C and SAC-D, aimed for scientific research and remote sensing, was being prepared for launching from 1999 to 2006.
In Brazil, great significance was attached to the collection of data from remote platforms using space technology.
The Brazilian Complete Space Mission (MECB) was successfully started in February 1993 with the launch of the Satellite de Coleta de Dados (SCD 1).
The satellite had remained operational two years after its expected useful life.
At least two similar satellites would be launched to ensure continuity of the mission.
In addition, the improved SCD 3 satellite (200 kg) would also be used in the mission to demonstrate the concept of voice and data communication in the equatorial region.
In Chile, the first operational satellite would be FASat-Bravo, developed in cooperation with the University of Surrey (United Kingdom).
The 46 kg microsatellite would be put into circular orbit at 650 kilometres with an inclination of 82.5 degrees in August 1996.
It would carry an ozone layer monitoring experiment, data transfer experiment, experimental Earth imaging system and some other equipment, including an educational experiment.
Using the communications link provided by the satellite, students would be able to engage in study activities (orbital mechanics, satellite communications analysis, telemetry analysis etc.) one or two days per month.
The Satellite Research Center of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) began its programme to develop space technology with the launch of two scientific and experimental microsatellites, KITSAT 1 and 2, in 1992/93.
Currently, KAIST was involved in designing its new indigenous satellite KITSAT 3 to enhance the capabilities of the previous two microsatellites.
A primary objective of the programme was to develop a microsatellite system that had highly accurate attitude control, high-speed data transmission and the ability to provide hands-on experience to Korean space industries and research institutes.
The remote sensing payload of KITSAT 3 would be able to monitor environmental disasters such as floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquake damages in the region of Asia and the Pacific.
In South Africa, the SUNSAT microsatellite project had been established in 1992 to increase engineering design opportunities for graduate students and to foster industrial and international interaction with Stellenbosch University.
The 60 kg microsatellite would be able to provide images of cultivated fields, natural vegetation and pollution around the globe.
The satellite would also be an electronic mailbox that would orbit the Earth to receive and deliver messages, as well as speech and data relay experiments to schools.
SUNSAT should be launched by the United States Delta launcher in March 1997 into polar orbit at 450 to 850 kilometres, together with the Danish magnetospheric research satellite Oersted.
SUNSAT would also carry the global positioning system (GPS) navigational receiver of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and a set of laser reflectors for precise positioning experiments.
A Spanish space project, MINISAT, was entrusted to the Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aerospacial (INTA), Madrid by the Spanish Inter-ministerial Commission for Science and Technology (CICYT) in 1992.
Modular satellites of 180 to 500 kg mass (depending on the number of modules used) would be launched by the Pegasus airborne launchers starting in 1996.
The first satellite MINISAT 01 would consist of the basic platform and would be used for scientific research.
Satellite MINISAT 1 would be an upgraded version, equipped for remote sensing observations and MINISAT 2 would use the basic platform to provide long-distance communications even from the geostationary orbit.
A small scientific sub-satellite MAGION 4 was launched on 3 August 1995 together with the INTERBALL 1 "mother" satellite.
MAGION 4 separated from the mother satellite after reaching the planned orbit (apogee 191,907 kilometres, perigee 793 kilometres, inclination 63.0 degrees).
The satellite had a mass of 60 kg and had been developed in cooperation by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (Czech Republic), Technical University, Graz (Austria) and the Space Research Institute (Russian Federation).
Its scientific payload was aimed at studying of the geomagnetic field, wave phenomena and plasma parameters of the ionosphere within the framework of the INTERBALL space project.
Simultaneous measurements by two satellites at a small distance from each other allowed for temporal and spatial resolution of the observed phenomena.
The Central European satellite for advanced research (CESAR) was a spacecraft of about 300 kg planned for 1998 that would fly in an orbit with a perigee of 400 kilometres, an apogee of 1,000 kilometres and an inclination of 70 degrees.
The scientific mission would be related to the study of the magnetospheric, ionospheric and thermospheric environment.
Ten different experiments, provided by scientists from Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, would be accommodated on board the spacecraft that was being constructed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).
A working group on small satellites was created in the French space agency CNES at the end of 1993 to propose recommendations for the development of a series of small satellites complementing the Satellite Système probatoire d'observation de la terre (SPOT) system, at a cost of less than 300 million French francs per mission and a development time of two years.
The recommended programme was called Plateforme reconfigurable pour l'observation, les télécommunications et les usages scientifiques (PROTEUS).
The first flight was envisaged in 1999 as a continuation of the successful France-United States altimetric satellite project Topex-Poséidon.
The missions that were being considered by the Small Missions Opportunities (SMO) initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) might be classified by the following parameters: 150-500 kg launch mass, orbit between 600 and 900 kilometres, development time of about two years, cost of less than 40 million European currency units for platform and integration, delivery on orbit, commissioning and user ground station. The basic concept of the SMO initiative was to have a common procurement of part or all of the following mission elements: launch, platform integration and ground segment.
That approach should achieve the low-cost benefits for those recurrent elements of the mission.
In addition to the support (technological assistance and launching arrangements) provided to emerging space-faring nations, described in other parts of the present report, NASA had adopted its own Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative (SSTI).
The technology programme should reduce the cost and development time of space missions for scientific and commercial applications.
It should achieve a payload/total mass fraction of up to 70 per cent and times, from development to flight readiness, of two years.
To achieve those goals, new design and qualification methods for small spacecraft should be demonstrated using commercial and performance-based specifications, integration of small instrumentation technology into the satellite bus design and end-to-end product development and flight verification.
The future NASA mission capability should result in a 30-60 per cent reduction of costs and new technology insertion into missions.
NASA was also preparing a series of small, low-cost planetary science missions under its Discovery programme.
They were designed to provide frequent investigative opportunities (one launch every 12-18 months) to the planetary research community, while encouraging partnerships with industry.
All solar system targets and objectives were valid candidates for the Discovery programme, but the spacecraft cost should be low and the launch vehicle would be limited to Delta class or smaller.
A total of 28 proposals were received in response to the first announcement of opportunity, covering the full range of planetary science objectives (the next announcement of opportunity was to be released in May 1996).
The first four missions were fully funded, and their development was on schedule and within cost guidelines.
II. OTHER SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PRESENTATIONS
A. Space debris
Objects moving in the near-Earth space were regularly tracked and catalogued by the United States Space Command Space Surveillance System.
That system operated more than 24 radar and several optical facilities to monitor near-Earth space and maintained a catalogue of orbital elements of all tracked objects (currently over 8,000).
The minimum diameter of observable objects was about 10 centimetres for LEO and 1 metre for geostationary-satellite orbit (GSO).
Objects in GSO were tracked mainly by the dedicated optical system Geosynchronous and Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS).
In addition, a special radar located at Haystack (near Boston, Massachusetts) was capable of detecting objects less than 1 centimetre in diameter in LEO and obtaining statistical information on number, flux, size and altitude.
There seemed to be over 100,000 space debris in LEO at sizes down to 1 centimetre.
The largest radar tracking facility in western Europe at the Research Establishment for Applied Science (FGAN) in Wachtberg-Werthhoven (Germany) was using a 34 metre parabolic dish antenna.
Data from that site were an important addition to the catalogue data in case of re-entry predictions for high-risk space debris.
The ESA had sponsored research on the feasibility of detecting and tracking medium-size debris (1-50 centimetres).
Regarding the debris measurement by optical telescopes, ESA would use a one-metre Zeiss telescope that was currently being installed at the Teide Observatory on Tenerife (Canary Islands, 28.3 degrees north latitude) for other purposes.
The minimum size of detectable objects would be 2-6 centimetres in LEO and 20-40 centimetres in GSO.
The telescope should be operational for space object observations at the beginning of 1997.
Information on particles smaller than about 1 millimetre was obtained mostly through special detectors carried by spacecraft or through the analysis of impacts on material that had been exposed to the space environment.
Many European researchers had analysed impact features on the NASA long duration exposure facility (LDEF) after its retrieval in January 1990, on the European recoverable carrier (EURECA) spacecraft and on the solar array retrieved from the Hubble space telescope (HST).
The largest hole diameters were about 5 millimetres.
Results of these analyses would be used to validate the present reference flux models for small-size meteoroids and space debris.
Examination of windows, radiator panels and other surfaces of the United States space shuttle orbiters showed that environmental models underestimated microdebris population and that the population was growing with time.
While the NASA space debris damage model Bumper predicted 13 window replacements in 12 shuttle missions, the actual number of replacements was 19.
In France, additional data from one year of exposure to space environment on board the Mir station (ARAGATZ mission) were used for comparison with space debris environment models.
Unique debris hazards associated with the proposed satellite constellations had been studied in the United Kingdom.
A satellite constellation was a distributed architecture of satellites that provided global positioning, Earth observation, hand-held personal communications, messaging or data transfer.
There were proposals for a large number of new systems, which would mean that over 1,000 new satellites would be placed into high inclination orbits at altitudes of 700-800 kilometres and 1,200-1,400 kilometres within 4-6 years.
Realization of such projects would result in concentrations of satellite mass at certain regions of space around the Earth.
B. Use of nuclear power sources in outer space
A numerical analysis related to possible collisions of nuclear power sources (NPS) with space debris had been performed by the Russian Federation.
The following contingencies had been examined in particular: destruction of NPS structure; change of orbital parameters of NPS after collision; their entry into the atmosphere; possible atmospheric destruction; and fallout of radioactive toxic material particles and parts of NPS structure.
Collisions with space debris had been considered for reactors launched in the period 1970-1988 and injected into orbits within the altitude range of 700-1,000 kilometres.
The probability of collisions with space debris, capable of considerable NPS damage, was sufficiently high and reached one in over 55 years.
Research on aerodynamic destruction of NPS and of the fuel rod assembly during their descent into the atmosphere after collision at the initial re-entry trajectory (altitude: 160 kilometres) confirmed that the NPS structure was destructed and the reactor fuel pins (uranium-molybdenum alloy) melted down to particle dimensions of less than 1 millimetre.
The results had shown that fallout of such nuclear fuel particles, allowing for uranium fission product decay at the moment of collision, would not lead to a significant change in the radiation levels over the fall-out territory.
The fall of the beryllium reflector parts and partially failed radiation shield of lithium hydride might constitute a threat from the point of toxicity, which would prompt search and clean-up (removal) measures.
In the United Kingdom, studies continued on possible supplements to the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/68 of 14 December 1992.
While the resolution included valuable consensus agreements on topics such as consultation, assistance to States affected by an accident, liability and compensation, it suffered from a number of limitations.
Among those were the exclusion of propulsion and extraterrestrial bases; their formulation in terms of particular technologies; ignoring the potential effects of space debris; and inconsistencies with the more mature safety principles developed for the terrestrial applications of nuclear power.
Therefore, a revision was suggested which generalized the intentions embodied in General Assembly resolution 47/68 in a way that was consistent with subsequent international developments under the aegis of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
C. Remote sensing
With the successful design, development, launch and in-orbit performance of the first generation of the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS), India was surging ahead to provide improved and enhanced data services from the second generation remote sensing satellites, IRS-1C and IRS-1D.
IRS-1C, which was launched on 6 December 1995, was characterized by an improved spatial resolution, extended spectral bands, stereo viewing and faster revisit capability.
Besides cartographic applications, the IRS-1C mission mainly addressed the following areas: crops and vegetation applications with specific reference to mixed crops and vegetation discrimination; biological parameters and oceanographic applications, in particular observations of physical oceanographic parameters such as winds, sea surface temperature, waves etc.; and atmospheric applications for monitoring global changes such as the depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic region.
The space research activities in Morocco, related to remote sensing and environmental monitoring, were characterized by an active, realistic and long-term policy at both the national level (coordination, information, training and project formulation) and the international level (participation in forums, international committees and bilateral and multilateral projects).
The use of outer space in Morocco was becoming ever more developed, extensive and diversified.
With regard to satellite data, stations were currently in operation to receive METEOSAT weather satellite data, for example, at the National Department of Meteorology (DMN).
There were plans to set up two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stations, one for meteorological studies at DMN and the other at the Royal Centre for Spaceborne Remote Sensing (CRTS) of Morocco for receiving advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data.
This station was to be set up within the framework of the GLOVE project, which was co-financed by the European Community.
GEOSPACE, a company located in Austria, was conducting a global mapping project to produce a digital atlas of the world.
The global satellite image mapping project aimed to develop a global geographic information system, which was easy to use, cost-effective and easily accessible for frequent updates.
Studies were being performed at the local, regional and international level.
The status of new commercial remote sensing satellites was reviewed by the Secretary General of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS).
These new satellites were intended to provide high resolution data, up to 2-5 metres, in the fields of meteorology, cartography, natural resources and commercial imaging.
Countries that, in the recent past, had been involved in the development of such commercial remote sensing satellites were France, Germany, India, Japan, Russian Federation and United States.
Furthermore, ESA was playing a major role in the development of new remote sensing satellites.
An outlook for the next decade indicated that 99 Earth observation satellite payloads were planned to be implemented, of which 57 payloads should be established within the next five years.
The new payloads would play a significant role in the development towards digital photogrammetry and remote sensing.
D. International Space University
The International Space University (ISU), established in 1988, placed emphasis on an interdisciplinary, international and intercultural space education programme.
ISU contributed to the development of professionals required in the international space arena, such as creators, innovators, managers and leaders.
ISU was dedicated to the education of professionals of all disciplines in space-related fields, the creation and expansion of knowledge through research, and the exchange and dissemination of knowledge and ideas.
During the course of the summer session programmes of ISU, comprehensive lectures were provided in all space-related disciplines and their interactions.
Furthermore, an international space project was designed during the summer curriculum, resulting in a professional report with practical utility for the international space community.
In addition to the summer session programmes, ISU had recently launched a Master of Space Studies programme, held at Strasbourg, France.
The one-year graduate programme comprised three major elements: (a) sciences and applications; (b) engineering, systems and technology; and (c) management and social sciences.
E. Space transportation
The Russian Federation continued the use of the middle- and heavy-class launchers of the Soyuz, Molniya and Proton type to launch communication, scientific and many other payloads into different orbits (including GSO).
Launchers Tsiklon and Zenit were produced in cooperation with Ukraine.
The most used cosmodrome in the world - the cosmodrome at Plesetsk - was responsible for 60 per cent of Russian launchings and 10 per cent worldwide.
During the 30 years of its existence (from March 1966), there had been almost 1,500 successful launchings.
Plans were progressing for a possible gradual building of the new Russian cosmodrome at Svobodny (Amur region) in the eastern part of the country.
Converted military rockets Start-1 and the more powerful Start and Rokot used solid fuel and would also be used in the space programme.
A Russian space corporation, a Ukrainian research and production centre Yuzhnoe, a United States company and a Norwegian shipbuilding company, were all cooperating within the framework of an international consortium on the preparation of commercial launchings from a sea-based platform near the equator.
The Association of Space Explorers (ASE) supported and endorsed the concept of the "X-Prize", a prize of US$ 10 million that would promote private industry development of a reusable, single stage, sub-orbital vehicle capable of carrying three adults (300 kg) to an altitude of at least 100 kilometres above the Earth.
The Association believed that the X-Prize would stimulate public interest in space exploration and development, and lead to the capability to fly many people into space, goals which the ASE promotes.
F. Astronomy and planetary exploration
In early 1995, the international astronomical community was dismayed by the publication of a proposal on behalf of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to mark its fiftieth anniversary by a launch of a solar reflector, the "Star of Tolerance".
It was to have been in the form of a double star comprising two reflecting balloons (one of 50 metres, the other of 30 metres in diameter, both connected by a 2-kilometres tether).
It would orbit the Earth at 1,250 kilometres and appear as bright as the star Sirius, or even as the planet Jupiter.
Fortunately the project was abandoned.
The "Star" itself would not be a disaster for astronomy, although it would be a significant hazard.
What did cause major concern within the astronomical community was the precedent it would set, if implemented.
It would be a clear signal that it was culturally, scientifically and educationally acceptable to use spaceborne solar reflectors to convey messages on an international scale.
In the field of radio astronomy, there were problems with artificial radio transmissions from orbiting satellites.
The interference caused by the Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) at 1612 MHz had recently been resolved.
Thus, the conditions for observing the important oxygen-hydrogen maser line at that frequency would rapidly improve.
However, a newly proposed satellite communication system, Iridium, was again threatening radio astronomical use of that band.
Although Iridium and the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory had reached a memorandum of understanding, the remainder of the radio astronomical community, with good reason, regarded that bilateral agreement as a poor basis for the future.
What was needed was some kind of operational mandate that would allow astronomy, civilization, industry and commerce to coexist.
Another mobile communication project, Teledesic, was looking for an allocation of frequency in the very high frequency range in the 19 to 29 GHz band, hitherto an unallocated millimetre wavelength.
That spectral region was one of particular importance to radio astronomy since there were many interstellar line emissions.
The detection of those signatures of the nature of cosmic chemistry would be of crucial importance in discerning how large chemical molecules could be constructed and where in the Universe such processes took place.
Great care would have to be exercised in assigning the millimetre frequency range for communications, if access to such far-reaching astronomical information was to be maintained.
The International Conference on Near-Earth Objects was held in New York from 24 to 26 April 1995.
It was co-sponsored by the Explorers Club, the Planetary Society and the United Nations.
The subject of the conference, Near-Earth Objects (NEO), was based on comets and asteroids whose orbits could intersect the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.
Since it has been generally understood that the impact of a kilometre-size NEO would have severe consequences on the terrestrial biosphere, it was of some interest to estimate its probability.
Astronomy and planetary science had shown that craters were an ubiquitous, if not dominant, feature on planets, moons and asteroids within the inner solar system.
Detailed studies of the cratering record indicated that the impact of NEO 1 kilometre or greater in size was a regular occurrence, with continuity over large time scales.
The main focus of NEO research at the present time should be towards generating more knowledge about the origin, evolution and dynamical and material characteristics of asteroids and comets that could interact within the immediate space environment of Earth.
Heightened public awareness about NEO and hazards associated with possible impacts must be met with a responsible explanation based on scientific knowledge.
From that perspective, NEO research provided an opportunity to pursue interdisciplinary scientific research in the basic space sciences through international cooperation.

A. Background and objectives
The General Assembly, in its resolution 43/56 of 6 December 1988, requested the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to consider at its thirty-second session a new agenda item entitled "Spin-off benefits of space technology: review of current status".
Pursuant to its work, the Committee, starting in 1992, recommended that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should consider devoting at least one of its training courses, seminars or expert meetings each year to the promotion of spin-off benefits from space.
At its thirty-eighth session in June 1995, the Committee endorsed the activities proposed for the Programme on Space Applications for 1996, as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-second session.
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995, endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1996.
The present report contains a summary of the proceedings, as well as the recommendations, of the United Nations/United States of America International Conference on Spin-off Benefits of Space Technology: Challenges and Opportunities, organized as part of the 1996 activities of the Programme.
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.
The main objectives of the Conference were: (a) to address the many new dimensions that were continuously being introduced into Earth based processes and procedures including the enhancement of scientific and technical capabilities made possible by space exploration; (b) to demonstrate to participants from developing countries the many ways that they and their countries have directly or indirectly benefited from space exploration; and (c) to address the opportunities available for developing countries to participate in additional ventures.
The participants at the Conference learned of several spin-off benefits of space technology, marketing and use of these technologies, and of industry experiences from the United States of America as well as developing countries.
Aspects of spin-offs explored included solar energy; fisheries operation; telecommunications; health and telemedicine; precision agriculture and crop yield assessment; navigation and global positioning; and global monitoring of natural resources and the environment.
Participants also discussed, in working groups, what they felt was necessary in order to learn more about the available technologies and how they could be effectively utilized in their own countries.
The present report covering the background, objectives and organization of the Conference, as well as the recommendations made by the participants, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
B. Participants
The United Nations and the United States targeted for participation in the Conference individuals in decision-making positions in governmental agencies and private industry who were working in programmes and projects in which spin-offs of space technology were being utilized.
To that end, the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and, in order to receive the full benefit of the programme, the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer.
Funds allocated by the United Nations and the United States for the Conference were used to cover international air travel and per diem expenses for the period of the Conference for the senior technical managers from selected organizations and companies from developing countries.
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Conference: Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Kazakstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Republic of Korea and United States; Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations; numerous agencies and departments of the United States Government and the European Space Agency (ESA).
Speakers and chairmen of the Conference came from Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland and United States.
I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE CONFERENCE
A. Background
It was stated that, in the spirit of Agenda 21,Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3-14 June 1992 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigenda), vol.
In furtherance of that endeavour, spin-off benefits of space technology had many applications that could enhance the quality of life.
Space technology applications had already had an impact on the lives of many individuals in numerous countries in such areas as distance education, training and development, land and crop monitoring including wasteland monitoring, water management and conservation through remote sensing assessment and run-off forecasting.
Spin-offs in the area of health care through telemedicine, hygiene and basic health-care awareness via satellite communication had also improved the quality of life of many individuals.
For the purposes of environmental monitoring and impact assessment, disaster prevention, monitoring and management, fragile ecosystem monitoring, forest resource management and regular monitoring of atmospheric gases, space technology and its spin-offs had certainly had a tremendous impact on the way the resources of the world were managed.
Cooperation was the key to maximize the benefits of products and services derived from space technology.
Cooperation should provide mutual benefits.
For example, when contracted to build satellite systems for developing countries, private companies had also agreed to train engineers and technicians from those countries in satellite design and assembly.
That would enable the ultimate consumers of the technology to use it effectively in its intended manner without having to constantly resort to the manufacturer for advice and assistance.
Moreover, it would greatly enhance the indigenous capability of the consumer country.
B. Space technology spin-off sectors of potential benefit to developing countries
1. Telemedicine and human health
It was stated that the provision of health services to non-urban and isolated areas had always been a challenge.
With the advent of major space exploration programmes, satellite telemedicine became more important.
As a result of improved technology, telemedicine was becoming increasingly cost-effective and because the health-care industry was facing growing financial constraints, alternative methods of delivering health care were being sought.
In this regard, health information and telemedicine systems were seen as a partial solution to health delivery problems.
As an example, in 1985, the International Telecommunication Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) gave a dedicated four-wire satellite telephony link between parts of Africa and the Memorial University of Newfoundland.
Through this link, health-care professionals in Canada were able to examine over 100 electroencephalograms from Africa with excellent results.
Other non-profit organizations were also attempting to provide improved health communications between developed and developing countries and these efforts were producing tangible results.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had also had much experience in the field of telemedicine by the establishment of various spacebridges.
In 1989, NASA established a spacebridge to Armenia five months after the earthquake in that region.
The system was a double satellite hop using the American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), INTELSAT and NASA Satcom satellites.
It consisted of a two-way audio channel and one-way black and white video link.
Once established, the system was used easily to alleviate the effects of other disasters in the region.
As a result, NASA increased the capabilities of the spacebridge by augmenting the system to include regular communication by facsimile and two-way colour video.
In 1993-1994, a spacebridge to Moscow was re-established using the double satellite hop technique.
In this case, two-way full-motion colour video and audio capabilities were included but the system was difficult and expensive to establish.
However, once established and operating, it was used effectively for consultations on patients.
With new technology, the spacebridge to Russia used independent computers connected via the Internet.
Store-and-forward consultations and regular communications were emphasized and it had two-way compressed video and audio equipment available for real-time consultations.
From the above, a paradigm shift in emphasis could be discerned.
That is, telemedicine was moving from real-time consultations, interactive video, dedicated "studio" systems and dedicated, broad-band telecommunications lines to medical informatics, predominantly store-and-forward consultations, desk-top computer systems, Internet and similar connections and interactive video consultations when required.
Therefore, a highly cost-effective health-care telecommunications system to even remote areas of the world was possible.
With regard to human health concerns, NASA was using remote sensing technology to study and characterize the habitats of different species around the world.
That led to the possibility of studying habitats which harboured vectors capable of transmitting diseases from one species to another.
Since certain diseases were associated with particular landscapes and environmental conditions, the study of those associations could provide research tools capable of identifying the time and place of future global outbreaks of human diseases.
In 1984, NASA initiated the Global Monitoring and Human Health Program which, in its first phase, used satellite remote sensing data to identify potentially high population mosquito rice fields weeks in advance of actual mosquito population increases in order to survey possible malarial outbreaks.
The Program had been expanded to include sites in Mexico to identify areas of high-potential malarial transmission risk.
Other target sites, such as Westchester County, New York, had been studied to establish if there was a correlation between the proximity of deciduous forest areas and the likelihood of contracting Lyme disease.
In addition, studies were being conducted on the role of plankton in the Bay of Bengal and how it related to cholera, as well as an analysis of outbreaks of yellow fever and ebola viruses in Africa.
Moreover, in terms of telemedicine, the Program also allowed for instantaneous consultation between agents in the field, scientists, doctors and other health-care workers in the event of disease outbreak.
2. Agriculture
It was stated that information derived from satellite remote sensing, aerial photography and space shuttle sensors could be used to estimate food and fibre production, and develop survey sampling frames and prediction models.
The data generated by the survey sampling frames and prediction models could be used in agricultural surveys as a way of accurately predicting crop yields, estimating and mapping crop damage, monitoring conservation practices and implementing precision farming practices.
Of the applications listed above, precision farming was the most promising as it provided farmers with pertinent information about growing conditions of a specific field area.
Using global positioning system (GPS) satellite technology, farmers had the possibility of providing detailed information about how conditions varied across a field to computer-assisted trackers that applied fertilizers or pesticides to areas in need of treatment.
This would undoubtedly reduce costs to farmers as well as the impact on the environment by the effective and selective utilization of fertilizer, water and other growth aids.
Crop acreage estimates could be produced through the use of Earth resource satellite data in combination with farmer-reported data.
Satellite and ground data analysed conjunctively could produce acreage data with substantially more statistical precision at local levels.
Earth observation and weather satellite data could be analysed together to aid in monitoring crop conditions throughout a growing season.
Also, monitoring of vegetation conditions on a national scale could be done through the use of data generated from polar orbiting weather satellites and other related data on crop stage, condition and yield data.
In the case of precision agriculture in the United States, the government-industry partnership had been particularly valuable for those small companies lacking available resources to develop an idea into a commercially viable project.
In close cooperation with the Space Remote Sensing Center in the NASA Stennis Space Center, a private industry initiative consisting of placing a series of four satellites in a low Earth, sun-synchronous orbit was under consideration.
This system being developed, would utilize change detection analysis using a multispectral satellite system with a 10 metre ground resolution.
By analysing images from space, farmers were able to identify locations in their fields that were under stress at an early stage and therefore apply fertilizer to the most affected areas as well as be able to determine what kind of fertilizer had been applied previously and what other farming methods had been used in the past in order to determine what method yielded the best results.
The project ultimately intended to provide farmers with an opportunity to make more informed farming decisions, maximize productivity and profits and minimize environmental degradation.
3. High resolution and data imaging applications
In the field of high resolution imaging, countries and individual users were able to access a wide range of products that had many useful applications.
High resolution digital data that could be used for small-scale mapping, storm water run-off monitoring, fire damage assessment, monitoring of illegal logging, or even for generating a comprehensive model of the planet, was now available to users worldwide.
In terms of global security, high resolution imaging and data applications could be used to monitor regional conflicts as well as terrorist and criminal activities, to a certain extent.
More importantly, in the field of peace-keeping, these images and data could be made available to countries and individuals around the world in a timely, accurate and cost-effective manner.
The distribution and relative abundance of many pelagic fisheries resources such as tuna, squid, sardines and anchovies were related to surface oceanographic conditions.
Normal fishing operations depended upon a captain's experience, which usually related to specific fishing zones at a specific time of year.
Nevertheless, fish abundance was more related to surface conditions than the calendar date, and such operations were variable with low catches predominating.
In the field of operational fisheries in Mexico, one particular company was using high-resolution oceanographic information to aid the operation of fisheries vessels and resource administration in near-real time.
That company had found that the information was useful in optimizing natural resources and the existing fishing infrastructure in the most cost-effective manner possible.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather satellites of the United States carried the advanced very high resolution radiometer, whose sensors provided 1.1 km resolution data which allowed the calibration of sea-surface temperature images over large areas of ocean.
This data could be made available to fishing vessels in near-real-time to direct their search operations to those areas more likely to contain fish.
The SEAWIFS sensor aboard a new satellite would shortly be able to provide information on sea-surface colour which could relate to plankton concentration and food availability.
By understanding the relationship between different pelagic resources and surface oceanography, large areas of limited fishing potential could be readily eliminated from the search strategy.
C. Research and development: government and industry roles
1. Federal Laboratory Consortium
Much of the work accomplished in the area of spin-off benefits of space technology was the result of the effort of scientists in the Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC).
FLC represented the technology outreach programmes of 16 federal departments and agencies operating over 600 national research and development laboratories.
The mission of FLC was to cooperate with the federal laboratories and the private sector in: (a) developing and administering technology transfer activities; (b) advising and assisting federal laboratories and industry in transferring technology; (c) providing a clearing-house for requests at federal laboratories for technical assistance from states, local governments and industry; and (d) facilitating communication, coordination and resolution of federal technology transfer activities throughout the federal research and development community.
Mechanisms used for accessing the resources and expertise of FLC included sharing information, exchanging personnel, finding technical assistance, using unique federal laboratory facilities and capabilities, licensing patents and technical know-how, acquiring software, performing cooperative research and development, using cooperative research and development agreements directly with private companies and other entities, working cooperatively with NASA, forming consortia and using technology developed under government contracts.
FLC also linked customers with producers and the FLC network was an invaluable tool when attempting to find out what information was available and where.
In addition to the FLC network, six regional technology transfer centres that were exactly aligned with FLC, had been established through a competitive process.
Four of the six were managed by universities.
Within each region, a series of affiliates provided a liaison service and, whenever possible, provided solutions to industry questions.
Forty per cent of the activities of this network was related to technology and concepts developed by NASA.
The centres worked with the innovative process model in high technology development aiming to benefit a specific industry.
The concept was developed and commercialized and then appropriate market research was done on the market viability of a product.
Once all steps were completed and a product was deemed appropriate for possible commercial ventures, the product would be offered to the private sector for financing and ultimate distribution to the market.
In the area of renewable energy, the United States Department of Energy had undertaken extensive research in the areas of the production of energy through wind, solar thermal sources, photovoltaic cells, as well as research in lasers, and high-temperature superconductivity.
In this regard, it had also worked with many developing countries to promote the use of renewable energy sources as a viable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to provide necessary power generation.
For the private sector, the advantages of working with the United States federal laboratory system was that the laboratories had a reservoir of facilities and talented people with the ability to undertake long-term projects that required more time and resources than what some private industries could provide.
One example involved imaging spectrometry. In that field the technology allowed a user to gather information over an observed area in order to determine what types of minerals were found in it and where, by a spectral analysis of the reflectance of some minerals.
The technology behind this tool was developed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
2. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
As NASA had a significant amount of technology that was being continually developed, it could be of interest for developing countries to work with it on mutually beneficial projects.
Many countries had entered into broad-based cooperation agreements with NASA in fundamental science and technology areas.
That is, NASA was striving to cooperate with civil space programmes of a particular country where mutually acceptable benefits could be derived.
That process entailed many steps.
The first was an initial request from a country interested in working with NASA. That was followed by an exchange of teams for discussions to determine common areas of interest.
Once a determination was made and the beneficial interests met the national interests of both countries and did not conflict with national policies on transfer of technology, then NASA would act as a coordinator for the benefit of that country with all other agencies and departments of the United States Government.
For a developing country looking to benefit from space exploration, that opportunity was unique and ultimately would provide the country with an example of how space exploration could be used.
In turn, that example could be examined and adapted by that country to meet its particular needs.
NASA also offered internships to foreign officials as long as reciprocal opportunities could also be made available for NASA officials.
The idea behind that policy was to create reciprocal relationships where knowledge was shared through mutually beneficial cooperation that furthered the interests of all involved. 3.
European Space Agency
In the area of technology transfer, ESA was actively engaged in providing opportunities to interested companies, individuals and other entities in learning about and acquiring new technology.
In this regard, it had created a European network of technology transfer information.
It had also undertaken feasibility studies on technology transfer projects and actively supported and promoted national initiatives in that area.
Some of the results and benefits of the ESA activities in that regard included the human reliability software developed through and for air-traffic control, alloys for use in medicine, human physiology experiments performed in microgravity and the peristatic pump currently used in panda pregnancy projects.
To facilitate technology transfer and enhance the benefit of space technology, ESA provided technical support, scientific data and financial and legal support.
That was performed in a manner meant to add value to a particular product or service and provided an appropriate basis for relevant pricing policies for products and services generated from space technology.
1. Specific industry experiences in developing countries
It was stated that by its very nature, space was a global market-place opportunity.
The opportunities available included, among others, commercial remote sensing, wireless communication, access to space (commercial launch) and precision positioning and timing.
In developing countries much work had been done on products that had been derived from work in their space agencies and organizations.
The industry opportunities in the area of spin-offs of space technology were also great.
High-technology companies operating in developing countries faced many issues that required attention.
Among them were the following: their removed location from sources of information and special components; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements; the lack of qualified suppliers, which resulted in more expensive in-house process development; and a less efficient country infrastructure.
The advantages for those companies were that more government incentives were available, labour was cheaper and there were more opportunities available because nearly everything was in need of some kind of improvement.
In the field of solar power, a company in Botswana was currently manufacturing and marketing solar panels for use in homes and businesses.
In the view of that company, because a majority of the world's population lived in rural and remote areas beyond national power grids and because the cost to build necessary infrastructure to reach those areas was high, using solar energy provided a less expensive alternative.
In the late 1970s many government incentives were given in Brazil for industry to start industries based in high technology.
As Brazilian industry experience in that area grew, the National Institute for Space Research of Brazil (INPE) also saw an opportunity and sought to find suitable companies to manufacture solar panels.
With its staff of engineers and scientists, INPE was capable of testing complete satellites and components as well as providing an environment where an exchange of ideas between private companies and the Institute could take place.
Through this relationship, a private company had been able to manufacture solar panels for INPE as well as work on the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite programme.
It had also built space components and assemblies for the Brazilian space programme.
As was the case in India, INPE continued to collaborate and work with Brazilian industry in the development of its space-based industry.
In Bulgaria, research work was being undertaken by the Bulgarian Aerospace Agency on Neurolab-B, which was designed for use on board the Mir space station for psycho- and physiological examination of crews.
A version of that system was also being developed for clinical environments on Earth.
The Agency had also developed an ultraviolet (UV) indicator for personal use that determined the presence and intensity of UV-A and UV-B radiation.
That device provided individuals with a clear indication of the intensity of the sun and therefore assisted individuals in determining the maximum amount of exposure to the sun under different circumstances.
Since the 1980s, the space technology and research industry of China had implemented a policy of applying space technology to benefit other national industries.
Of space research-derived applications, over 20 per cent were usually incorporated into other industries.
Satellite temperature control, satellite and payload control, low temperature technology and others had added significant improvements in product quality, working environments and energy conservation in traditional industries.
Some examples of spin-offs in China included a low temperature thermal tube transducer, a new energy resource, Zn-Air cell, based on the H2-O2 fuel cells used in satellites and large Zn-O2 storage batteries, a photoelectronic diameter measurement system and an elaborate industrial process control system.
The Chinese space industry endeavoured to apply space technology to common and special projects and had achieved significant results in noise reduction, electromagnetic shielding, surface processing, anti-seismic consolidation technology, flame-proof technology, modern greenhouse technology and environmental protection technology among others.
China actively supported the work of relevant departments to carry out projects involving the redevelopment and application of space technology.
India provided another example of government/industry cooperation in developing countries.
In terms of technology transfer arrangements, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) worked closely with industry in all facets of development of space-derived products and services.
It was not simply the case that technology was handed directly to industry.
There was continuous interaction between companies and ISRO in order to ensure that proper quality control procedures, inspection standards and other manufacturing requirements were followed.
Examples of that interaction included spin-off products that had been marketed under various trade names.
These products include a polymeric resin developed through the work and know-how of ISRO.
That product had been used for many applications including coating for many space components and parts and other industrial machinery.
Through the effective participation of engineers of a private Indian company in all stages of development of low-cost optical equipment for visual interpretation of satellite remote sensing data, a licence agreement was granted to that company to market those products.
From that work, several products had been successfully marketed by the company and it had been able to expand into areas of medical imaging equipment and machine tool manufacturing.
Some conclusions that could be drawn from the highly cooperative and interactive venture between Indian industry and ISRO included the following: (a) smaller companies run by technically qualified entrepreneurs were more likely to succeed in absorbing technology quickly; (b) the licensor should identify a single person in its organization with whom the licensee could communicate directly for all matters related to technology transfer; (c) the number of recipients for a particular technology/product know-how should be in proportion to its perceived or estimated market potential; and (d) technology transfer, if effected properly, would enable the licensee to acquire skills that would be used for developing new products using the same technology but for totally different applications.
The last recommendation was another form of spin-off benefit of space technology that could have a multiplier effect, resulting in the development of many different products by the licensee, with or without assistance from space laboratories.
A Mexican fishery company was optimizing natural resources by using high-resolution oceanographic information to help with the operation of fisheries vessels (see paragraphs 23 and 24, above).
A Nigerian company based in the United States, was currently planning and undertaking an ambitious project called the African Telecommunications, Applications, Manufacturing, Research and Development Project.
The project's goal was to establish in Africa an indigenous operation to improve and expand telecommunications services and applications, and to design and manufacture, for domestic and export markets, a range of telecommunications products, using state-of-the-art technology.
The project aimed at developing a significant, competent and globally competitive African capacity in communications technology, with a genuine scientific and technological cutting-edge capability by the provision of products.
Because most telecommunication products and services currently used in Africa were imported, many products were not specifically tailored to the needs of the African continent and were therefore underutilized, became obsolete quickly, did not build sufficient capacity for Africans and created an environment of perpetual dependency on foreign companies and policies.
Using space technology in the telecommunications field would deliver a wide spectrum of products and services custom-tailored to the specific needs of Africa and would contribute to its overall development and modernization.
The scope of the project would cover a comprehensive field of communications including signals, information and data processing, transmission (cable and satellite), switching (central office and private exchanges) and end-user products and services.
The project would start with a core of services and products and expand to a wider scope as experience, local needs, demand and business opportunities increased.
Following the recent change in the political situation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the aviation industry in Poland began to concentrate on the development of high-quality products.
Transfers of technology became possible and led the Polish aviation industry to also enter the space technology market.
As a result, in 1993 a consortium of scientific and technical institutes in the field of space, avionic and electronic industries, and smaller private sector firms dealing with space technology was established.
That consortium provided products and services in the area of construction of scientific instrumentation for satellites and probes, tracking systems, mechanical structures, board electronics, data collection, processing and transmission, ground support equipment, space telecommunication subsystems, environment protection with space technology, satellite geodesy and navigation and other related applications.
In terms of spin-offs of space technology, the consortium was currently involved in the manufacture of universal hand-held receivers to be used with GPS and in the Central European satellite for advanced research (CESAR).
2. Intellectual property concerns
Once a business had intellectual property either through the federal Government or developed on its own, appropriate action should be taken to protect that property.
Protection of trade secrets, inventions and designs, computer software, trademarks and product configuration should be sought in order to protect rights inherent in those products.
Confidentiality agreements could be used in addition to applying for patent and trademark protection.
Before offering an invention for sale or publicly using the invention or disclosing it to others, businesses or individuals should apply for protection in each country where protection was desired.
Moreover, before commercializing an invention, it was necessary to ensure that that invention did not infringe on the patents owned by others.
Also, compliance with export control and foreign licensing regulations was essential.
Another area in which care was required was licensing technology.
That practice was done for a variety of reasons depending on business goals, market situations, type of licensee and antitrust considerations.
Licenses could be exclusive or non-exclusive and could be limited in geography, field of use or time.
Royalties depended on patent strength, industry practices, value added and other factors.
It was essential that proper planning and preparation was undertaken in order to ensure that intellectual property was clearly protected.
For many companies from developing countries involved in the field of space technology, certain preconditions should exist in order to proceed with space research as a tool for the development of advanced technology.
The preconditions included an existing level of experience and education in order to quickly absorb new knowledge; the organization of existing groups and institutions in a way that enabled the smooth flow of relevant information; close collaboration between research groups in order to produce the best results; international cooperation; and, in particular, cooperation with more experienced partners in order to successfully transfer technology and subsidies from government or other sources.
Developing countries should also take cognizance of the resources available for training and education.
For example, regional centres for space science and technology education were forming in various regions of the world.
One had recently been established in India.
Those centres offered unique opportunities for individuals to learn about space technology, including spin-offs on the themes of remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite communications, geopositioning systems and atmospheric science.
The overall objective of the centres was to contribute to the utilization of all opportunities provided by space exploration.
The training to be offered by the centres should provide opportunities for individuals in the region to receive enhanced knowledge in priority application areas of space technology, as well as increasing the capacity of those individuals to exploit Earth observation data for environmental monitoring and disaster management and mitigation.
Research and development support for national institutions in the various regions should also be available through the work of the centre.
The United States Space Foundation had, as one of its objectives, the aim of inspiring students and enhancing learning by using space science and technology.
To that end, since 1986, the Space Foundation had organized a five-day graduate-level course designed to teach educators how to incorporate space and aviation themes into school lesson plans.
The programme had effectively provided training to over 5,000 educators who had, in turn, passed that knowledge on through their classrooms.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On the final day of the Conference, participants had the opportunity to participate in working groups to discuss space technology applications in health, biomedicine and education and human resource development, and communications for development.
Within the framework of the specific theme of each working group, observations and recommendations were requested from the groups on the following issues:
(a) The challenges and opportunities facing developing countries in those areas;
(b) The way in which the challenges were being met;
(c) The way in which local indigenous entrepreneurs and industries could prepare themselves for such a role;
(d) The roles of Governments in ensuring the necessary enabling environment;
(e) The way in which support of developed countries for technical development at the local level was obtained;
(f) The role of the United Nations as a facilitator.
The Working Group on Space Technology in Health, Biomedicine and Education Applications and Human Resource Development addressed the issues in detail.
The Working Group identified an adequate human resource base as a necessary starting-point.
Furthermore, such a base would need to improve its skills periodically in order to meet future challenges.
The Working Group felt that because technology transfer was a two-way process and required both the user and the provider to benefit, it was important that when contacts were made between a potential provider and user, both parties should realize that each would benefit from the transaction.
With regard to initial contacts between potential providers and users, it was noted that large companies might not necessarily be the best contact for research and experimental institutions when seeking potential partners in specific transactions.
It might therefore be more appropriate to approach small- to medium-sized firms.
However, a potential problem in that approach was that such firms did not necessarily have available the resources needed to establish business contacts with industry counterparts, such as in connection with industry trade shows.
The Working Group recommended that the United Nations could perform a vital role in filling information gaps.
Because there was either limited or no exchange of information about technical papers and research being conducted throughout the world on subjects related to spin-off potential of space science and technology, owing to cost and effectiveness factors, the Working Group suggested that the United Nations should develop a database that contained that information in an electronic format.
It was hoped that the database could serve as a catalyst for the further development of space spin-off technology.
With regard to the organization of such a database, the Working Group suggested that it should be practical, completed within the next three years and could receive input from, and feed back into, the worldwide university system.
Other potential roles for the United Nations included the identification of companies that had received spin-off technology from the space laboratories of space-faring nations, an assessment of their capabilities, and an inquiry about their interest in participating in transferring their know-how to other interested companies in developing countries.
Recognizing that some of the following actions required the agreement of governments, the Working Group indicated that the United Nations could prepare and periodically update a comprehensive brochure listing technologies/products available for transfer, prepare guidelines for recipients and providers of those technologies/products and devise a legal framework within which the technology transfer could take place.
The United Nations could give wide publicity to the comprehensive list by providing it to interested industries in developing countries as well as arranging seminars and meetings with significant industry participation in order to fine-tune the system.
The Working Group also suggested that the next conference on the subject of spin-off benefits of space technology should be in a developing country and should focus on how the suggested database should be developed.
It was suggested that participants at the next conference could, among other activities, comprehensively define the parameters of the database prior to its development and distribution.
With regard to its contents, it was suggested that the database should have search capabilities so that interested companies, industries, individuals and others would have the opportunity to find information on potential partners and to publicize their capabilities in an easily accessible forum, as well as to solicit industry-specific partners.
Finally, it was suggested that industries, companies and firms in developing countries involved in that field as well as in other terrestrial-based industries needed to send information on their products and services to commercial attachés at the embassies and missions of various countries, as well as to their own embassies and missions around the world.
That would not only keep interested parties informed about the existence of these entities, but could also attract interested industries to the products and services offered.
The Working Group on Communications for Development: Development of Communications Infrastructure with Emphasis on Application Opportunities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Global Information Systems also analysed each issue in detail.
With regard to the challenges facing developing countries, it was felt that there was a low penetration of existing communications technology in developing countries as opposed to developed countries.
In particular, agricultural areas were poorly serviced because of the sheer size of the areas and the expense associated with placing and operating the technology in those areas.
The Working Group also felt that there was a lack of training and knowledge of the technology.
Finally, the group felt that another important challenge was the availability of investment capital.
Given the challenges, the Working Group stated that opportunities for industries, companies, individuals and other entities in developing countries existed in installing, furnishing equipment and operating communications services.
In this connection the Working Group felt that partnerships with experienced providers through joint ventures or other types of business arrangements might be a way of providing necessary services as well as receiving required technology.
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services, the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems, space or ground based.
With regard to installation costs and communication costs, the Working Group noted that opportunities were available for financial institutions who could provide competitive financing to those parties interested in creating communication networks.
In terms of a communications system itself, it was suggested that opportunities for entrepreneurs to introduce innovative low-cost systems such as a party-line were readily available.
With regard to training necessities as well as concerns with acceptance of the technology by the general public, the Working Group stated that an opportunity existed to provide specialized training to individuals on the manufacture and maintenance of the technology.
That, coupled with effective public relations, could help to make the technology more acceptable to the general public.
In terms of meeting the challenge, it was stressed that further development of educational institutions and programmes in developing countries was necessary.
In order to build a solid foundation for future entrepreneurs and innovators it was felt that basic education was of particular importance, with an emphasis on applied research and technology transfer and adaptation.
In order to create an investment atmosphere, the Working Group stated that the political will and commitment of national leaders for the introduction of new technology should be apparent.
The Working Group also stressed that infrastructural needs such as roads, electricity and water supply should already be established, with the recognition that the needs of each country were different from one another.
In the same vein, steps should be taken that encouraged the existing financial systems in each country to develop a long-term commitment to the development activities in a country in the area of space technology spin-offs and generally, for basic sustainable development programmes.
The Working Group also stated that a significant step in meeting the challenges was the establishment and maintenance of contacts with potential facilitating organizations from around the world such as NASA.
Therefore, when an opportunity for a cooperative venture arose, it was both encouraged and taken.
Also of importance to the Working Group was the substantive involvement of the private sector as much as possible in those projects in order to ensure their sustainability.
Moreover, business leaders needed to talk to government representatives to state their interests as well as using other methods to express their views, including contact with chambers of commerce.
Finally, the information generated from this Conference should be passed on to relevant and supportive government agencies in order to facilitate follow up.
The Working Group stated that local entrepreneurs and industries could prepare themselves to begin development activities by acquiring licences to technology, training on how to effectively utilize know-how and how to effectively manage a high-technology based business.
Another possibility was to use the turn-key approach to receiving technology as long as in-depth and substantive training came with the technology.
It was important to be familiar with local market conditions and technologies.
Also stressed was an understanding of the concept of "added value" at each stage of a development process.
The elaboration of a sound business plan was recognized as being of paramount importance in explaining future plans in a manner capable of attracting interested investors to the value of products and services to be offered to the public.
Also, participants felt that in order to attract the participation of developed industrialized countries, any proposed activity also had to provide those countries with a benefit.
The shared interests of both parties had to be met in order to obtain commitments of entities from the developed countries.
Networking facilitated technical development opportunities in the establishment of contacts with government, industry, academia, financial organizations and others.
Those should not be missed.
With regard to obtaining the support of the developed countries, participants were of the view that contacts should be established on a person-to-person basis at the local level.
Direct contact among industry leaders could also do much to facilitate partnerships and collaborative ventures.
In terms of creating a friendly investment climate to facilitate national and foreign capital flow into spin-off industries, participants suggested that Governments could create technology incubators where small businesses could have the chance to germinate and build their businesses.
Governments could provide subsidies and financing on a liberal and competitive basis and they could provide research and development, funding and facilities to encourage and facilitate technology transfer and could provide tax incentives to pioneering investors.
The caveat with regard to incentives was that all entities or individuals should have equal opportunities to obtain them.
Participants also noted that a proper and appropriate regulatory environment should be established that kept pace with improvements in the technological environment.
As a result of the discussions in the Conference, it was felt that effective and close coordination between government and industry was absolutely necessary to further development programmes in the area.
Finally, creating an investment-friendly environment by having political, social and economic stability would greatly enhance the possibilities of foreign investments in emerging markets.
Incentives to encourage foreign investment could be given; foreign investment was important, in that technology acquired from abroad could be adapted to meet local needs as long as incentives for local investors were balanced against that.
The participants felt that the United Nations could create and promote networking opportunities and provide neutral advice to interested entities.
It could also continue to take a proactive approach in this area and assist in continued training and education through conferences, workshops and training courses on space technology applications.
Also, as a clearing-house of information, the United Nations should strive to further advertise and disseminate funding opportunities that were available.
Participants also discussed the possibility of the appropriate funding and development institutions of the United Nations system providing seed money directly to least developed countries to develop space technology applications, spin-offs of space technology and other areas.
Participants also indicated that funds involving projects in the private sector could be provided directly to those projects.
The proposal included the caveat that a proper monitoring mechanism would ensure that the funds were being used for the purposes intended.
Beyond the issues examined, the Working Group discussed the potential interaction between developing countries.
It was felt that developing countries should strengthen their own networks and strive to cooperate further.
Developing countries should work together in partnerships for their own mutual benefits in order to enhance regional, multinational and global ties.
Developing countries should also look to the possibility of reducing local trade barriers with the assistance of the World Trade Organization, the United Nations system and other regional organizations.
Finally, the more developed of the developing countries should make continuing efforts to assist the less developed countries.

INTRODUCTION A. Background and objectives 1. In its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, the General Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82) and decided, among other things, that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should promote the dissemination of information on advanced space applications and new systems developments among Member States, particularly for the benefit of the developing countries.
2. The United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Microwave Remote Sensing Applications, held from 22 to 26 April 1996, was one of the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1996 that could further that objective.
Those activities were endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995.
The Workshop was organized in cooperation with the Government of the Philippines and hosted by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) of the Philippines for the benefit of participants from developing countries.
3. The objective of the Workshop was to expose the participants to various aspects of current and future microwave remote sensing systems, as well as to applications of radar data to natural resource exploration and environmental monitoring.
The Workshop featured the experiences and programmes of a number of countries, especially those from the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in the development and application of microwave remote sensing.
The Workshop concluded with working group deliberations that focused on three major areas: data availability and accessibility; practical applications of radar data; and required education and training.
4. The present report, which covers the background, objectives, organization, observations and conclusions of the Workshop as well as a summary of the lectures presented, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their respective countries.
B. Organization and programme of the Workshop
5. The participants were professionals with several years of experience in the field of remote sensing, the management of natural resources and other related programmes that can benefit from microwave remote sensing applications.
The Workshop was attended by 68 participants from the following States, United Nations entities and international bodies: Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Palau, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United States of America, Vanuatu and Viet Nam; United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations; and the European Space Agency (ESA) and SPOT Asia (Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT): French Earth observation satellite).
6. Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA for the organization of the Workshop were used to defray the cost of international air travel and living expenses (hotel accommodation and daily subsistence allowance) of 20 participants from the region of Asia and the Pacific.
The Government of the Philippines, through NAMRIA, provided conference facilities and equipment, local transportation and midday meals for all the participants.
7. Opening addresses were made by J. Solis, Administrator, NAMRIA, on behalf of the Government of the Philippines; by J. Lichtenegger on behalf of ESA; and by A. A. Abiodun, United Nations Expert on Space Applications, Office for Outer Space Affairs.
8. The programme of the Workshop was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA and covered the following major areas: (a) national programmes (presentations made by M. Nur, Indonesia; S. Park, Republic of Korea; V. Phan, Viet Nam; L. Posadas, Philippines; K. Osman Salleh, Malaysia; M. Sebastian, India; and C. Keng Yew, Singapore); (b) spaceborne radar remote sensing in the 1990s (presentations made by S. Ahmed, Canada; Y. Bechacq, SPOT Asia; J. Guifei, China; J. Lichtenegger, ESA; E.

Abiodun, Office for Outer Space Affairs; D. Pradhan, UNEP; and R. Schumann, ESA).
The programme of the Workshop also included a visit to NAMRIA facilities at Manila.
9. The Workshop was conducted through a number of plenary and working group sessions.
During the working group sessions, the participants discussed the issues associated with microwave remote sensing.
Their observations and recommendations are summarized in section I of the present report.
The participants also noted that the recommendations should be pursued in conjunction with the international exchange of ideas, which were nurtured by the collaborative nature of the Workshop.
To further such collaboration and to evaluate the implementation of recommendations made by the working groups, the participants agreed that a follow-up workshop should take place within two years.
10. At the conclusion of the Workshop, the participants expressed their appreciation of the scientific and technical quality of the programme and the presentations delivered.
In addition, they expressed their thanks to the co-sponsors for the support received, making possible their participation in the Workshop, and also to NAMRIA for the cooperation and support of its administrative and technical personnel.
I. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKSHOP
11. The proceedings of the working group sessions focused on the following three major areas of microwave remote sensing: data availability and accessibility; practical applications of radar data; and required education and training.
The discussions included references to the experience acquired in satellite microwave remote sensing by the international scientific and user communities.
A. Data availability and accessibility
12. Based on the in-depth discussions of the working group, the participants noted that various sources of data could be provided by current technology.
At the same time, the working group observed that the issue of data availability and accessibility could be an obstacle to the successful utilization of microwave remote sensing data in developing countries.
The working group noted the following problems associated with the acquisition of data:
(a) Product catalogue: lack of information on the availability of data; and complexity of data accessing;
(b) Processing and delivery time: lack of publicized delivery standards; need for near real time (NRT) data cannot be met in many cases; and lack of standardized naming of product processing levels;
(c) Programming requests for data acquisition: conflicts in handling programming requests, especially in cases of emergency;
(d) Data format: data could be difficult to read.
13. On the basis of the working group discussion, the Workshop made a number of recommendations in order to inform the data providers on the fundamental needs of the users.
The recommendations have been summarized as follows:
(a) Ground receiving station (GRS) operators should make information on data received available within 24 hours after reception through a catalogue browsing system on the Internet;
(b) GRS operators should make high-quality quick-looks or small subscenes available within three hours after reception for downloading via public networks;
(c) Earth observation satellite (EOS) operators should develop a centralized worldwide catalogue database and make metadata and quick-looks available to all users free of charge.
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) should encourage the preparation of a master catalogue on data availability for all EOS;
(d) GRS operators should commit themselves to meeting product delivery times, recommended by the Workshop as follows:
(i) Regular service - 10 days;
(ii) Rush service - 48 hours;
(iii) NRT service - 3 hours.
(e) GRS operators should standardize the naming and specifications of data products;
(f) In emergency cases, countries in the region of South-East Asia should have an agreement to disseminate data taken within the footprint of their operational GRS;
(g) In emergency cases, GRS operators should give programming priority to users that would handle disasters with an environmental and social impact;
(h) EOS operators should coordinate conflicting programming requests, especially in emergency cases, and CEOS should provide required guidelines on the prioritization of programming requests;
(i) GRS operators should provide users with software which is able to read data from different platforms.
The digital product should contain:
(i) Description file in ASCII codes of all information pertinent to the data;
(ii) Files containing source codes for reading the header for different platforms (UNIX, VMS, PC etc.);
(iii) Header file;
(iv) Data file.
14. The participants in the Workshop also emphasized that CEOS should play a leading role in the coordination and synchronization of activities of all EOS operators in order to optimize the availability of microwave remote sensing data.
B. Practical applications of radar data
15. The participants noted that the following major application areas were of particular interest and relevance to developing countries in the region of Asia and the Pacific:
(a) Hazards mapping (natural and man-made), including: volcanic and seismic hazards; earthquakes; tsunamis; oil spills monitoring; flooding vulnerability, assessment and monitoring; and disaster management;
(b) Base mapping, including: photogrammetry/topographic mapping; preparing terrain profiles for the design of communication systems; geological structure mapping; and bathymetric mapping;
(c) Agriculture and forestry, including: forest inventory and monitoring (especially mapping of old growth forests and forestry on hilly areas); crop identification and monitoring; harvest forecasting; crop suitability; soil classification (with emphasis on soil moisture and soil suitability measurements); mangrove cover; and land cover;
(d) Marine and meteorology, including: sea-surface temperature mapping; ocean wastes mapping; coastal management (especially erosion assessment of coral reefs); wave height assessment; forecasting of wave conditions on shipping routes; fisheries (with emphasis on mapping of coastal habitats and location of fishing grounds); tides and currents (patterns, measurements and observations); and wind speed;
(e) Environmental monitoring, including: air/water pollution monitoring; preparation of environmental impact assessments (EIA); epidemiological studies (breeding grounds of disease-bearing insects); and monitoring of mining environments related to requirements of environmental clearance certificates (ECC);
(f) Resource inventory and planning, including: coastal changes related to urbanization; geological hazard studies for urban planning; ground-water identification; geological structure/mineralization studies (modelling); land-use studies; analysis of rehabilitation measures for disaster areas; landfill site selection; and terrain analysis for radio propagation applications.
16. The participants agreed that microwave remote sensing technology had reached a level that could contribute significantly to activities of economic importance.
With the exception of meteorological applications, however, the majority of application areas still required considerable research and support, through modelling, in order to improve interpretation of the data.
17. Since remote sensing technology utilizes radiation from the ultraviolet spectrum to microwaves, the potential benefits of the appropriate complementary and additive use of all wavelength data and acquisition techniques were advocated at the Workshop.
18. It was noted by the working group that the required frequency of observation for many of the parameters greatly exceeded that obtainable from a single platform.
The working group recognized that development of the necessary multi-platform system would not be feasible for a single agency.
However, given the number of systems proposed for the coming decade, cooperation and coordination between both the providing agencies and the ground reception facilities could enable the repeat coverage required.
The working group noted that this subject is on the agenda of CEOS.
19. It was also stated by the working group that data delivery in many cases needed to be improved considerably from the current situation. This is specifically the case for those applications which require a rapid response to a given situation.
The participants also observed that there was a real need for the development of proven methodologies for data analysis.
20. Members of the working group indicated that the majority of users in developing countries experienced difficulties in acquiring and upgrading the hardware and software required for data processing and analysis.
There was also inadequate technical and financial support to pursue the applications.
21. The participants observed that inadequate education and training did not allow users in developing countries to fully utilize microwave remote sensing data and to integrate this information into the regional, national and local decision-making processes.
22. With the above in mind, the working group made a number of recommendations that have been summarized as follows:
(a) Present and potential users should be given more training in microwave technology applications to facilitate full implementation of the technology and utilization of acquired data.
It would also enable the users to successfully implement demonstration projects that might subsequently provide the basis for decision makers to expand the use of such data in order to address national and regional needs;
(b) The Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the region of Asia and the Pacific region should place more emphasis on teaching and training programmes in microwave technology;
(c) Active cooperation and collaboration of ESCAP countries in information exchange should be encouraged in order to share experiences in practical applications of radar data, as well as information on project proposals, funding opportunities and available resource persons;
(d) To achieve extensive utilization of the data, a multi-tier pricing policy should be introduced whereby the cost of the data would depend on the particular need of the user.
Data sharing among the users within one country should be encouraged;
(e) A worldwide inventory of resources related to microwave remote sensing, which would include information on experts, projects, organizations involved and their activities, should be prepared and made available on-line via the Internet.
C. Required education and training
23. The working group acknowledged that the present and forthcoming radar systems for Earth observation were very relevant to Member States in the Asian region.
This new technology requires that an extensive education and training programme should be set up to enable Member States to obtain the full benefits from airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems.
24. Some of the key issues addressed by the working group pertaining to education and training were: who needs to be trained (e.g. decision makers, professionals, technicians and educators); what should be taught (e.g. principles, techniques, applications, data processing and interpretation and software training); where the training should take place (e.g. in-house, on-the-job, locally, nationally, regionally or internationally); and how the training should be conducted.
25. The participants also addressed the issues of maintaining international and regional links between national educational and research institutions, as well as international information and scientific exchanges, technology transfers, and availability and sharing of data and equipment.
26. After discussing the above-mentioned issues in some detail, the following recommendations were formulated by the working group:
(a) Dissemination of information on fellowships, training and research opportunities in microwave remote sensing should be improved.
The information should be available on-line via the Internet;
(b) The United Nations, in cooperation with the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the region of Asia and the Pacific, should undertake a survey to determine current local training requirements and priorities for bilateral and multinational collaboration in microwave technology education, research and applications;
(c) The possibility of incorporating short-term training courses, workshops and seminars into a programme for providing participants with credit toward a certificate or diploma in remote sensing or any other certification leading to a formal academic degree should be considered;
(d) Donor countries should be encouraged to increase the number of fellowship, training and research opportunities available for scientists, researchers and professionals from developing countries;
(e) Recognizing the important role of the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education for the region of Asia and the Pacific established in India, the participants called upon Governments in the region to sign the relevant agreement with the Centre as soon as possible and to actively participate in all the activities of the Centre.
II. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
A. Earth Observation Programme of the European Space Agency
27. Monitoring of the Earth environment and effective management of its natural resources are the necessary elements of sustainable development.
ESA, through implementation of its Earth Observation Programme, supports those activities by providing a range of remote sensing technologies and support infrastructure that are under continual development, and by encouraging the application of those systems through varied and expanding training activities.
The main objectives of the ESA Earth Observation Programme include the following elements:
(a) Monitoring the Earth environment at various scales;
(b) Monitoring and management of Earth resources;
(c) Continuation and improvement of services in operational meteorology;
(d) Improved understanding of Earth dynamics;
(e) Serving and responding to user community needs.
28. In order to ensure that the above-mentioned objectives are met, the Earth Observation Programme comprises a variety of activities that range from satellite and instrumentation development and operation to data utilization and training.
The activities are aimed at encouraging the adoption of remote sensing techniques for a wide range of applications, including the Earth Observation Satellites mission, the Meteorological Programme (METOP) and the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) missions, future Earth Observation missions, the Earth Observation Preparation Programme, the Data User Programme and the development of the Earth Observation Data Policy.
29. The most visible current activity of ESA in the area of Earth observation may be the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) programme.
ERS-1 was launched on 17 July 1991, and has operated in orbit for over four years, continually providing a wide range of high-quality microwave data about the Earth and its environment.
This satellite was joined in orbit by its near twin, when ERS-2 was launched on 21 April 1995.
With the Active Microwave Instrument (SAR and Wind Scatterometer) and Radar Altimeter remaining unaltered from ERS-l, modifications to the second satellite payload involved the addition of a completely new instrument, the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, modification of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer and the upgrading of the Precise Range and Range-rate Equipment for determining orbital position.
30. The ERS programme should provide an overlap with the next major ESA development, the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), currently scheduled for launch in 1998/99.
This is important since it will provide data continuity into the next century, thus bridging the gap between the technology in orbit today and that now under development.
Instruments on board ENVISAT include: Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar; Radar Altimeter; Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer; Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding; Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars; Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer; Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography; Scanner for Radiation Budget; and Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite.
31. ENVISAT is expected to have a five-year life-span, and will incorporate the possibility of utilizing data relay satellites in addition to ground stations for the downlink of its data.
32. Meteosat operations, handled by Eumetsat from 1 December 1995, are now entering into a transitional phase between the current Meteosat Operational Programme and the MSG Programme.
Meteosats 3 and 4 were de-orbited in November 1995, leaving Meteosat 5 to continue to support the nominal mission.
Meteosat 6, remaining on standby, will be followed by a transitional satellite in mid-1997, with the first of the MSG satellites scheduled for a launch in the year 2000.
33. METOP-1 is the first of a series of three satellites that are to be employed primarily for meteorological and climate monitoring operations.
METOP-1 is expected to be launched in 2001.
These polar orbiting missions will enhance, and eventually replace, the current meteorological satellites of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America flying in the so-called morning orbit.
34. The space segment and part of the payload for METOP-1 is being developed and provided by ESA, while Eumetsat will be responsible for its operations and for subsequent satellites in the series.
The remainder of the payload is to be provided by NOAA, Eumetsat and European national space agencies.
35. Improvements over the existing systems include higher spatial and spectral resolutions in both the visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, more frequent imaging, air mass analysis and more timely data dissemination.
Additionally, there is the possibility of including scientific and search and rescue packages as a payload option.
The programme, consisting of three satellites, will mean that the provision of data can be expected to continue until well beyond the turn of the century.
B. Advanced Land Observing Satellite mission
36. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) is a Japanese high-resolution Earth observation satellite that is to be used for cartography and for environmental and hazard monitoring applications.
To meet user requirements and future regional observation needs, the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan has decided to equip the satellite with both optical and microwave high-resolution sensors.
A high-resolution Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) as well as a Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) were chosen as the mission instruments of ALOS.
ALOS is currently scheduled to be launched in 2002.
37. In order to accommodate high-performance sensors, the ALOS satellite system will have several outstanding capabilities, among which are precise determination of position and attitude and the capability to handle large volumes of data.
ALOS will carry a star-tracker instrument for accurate attitude determination and phase-tracking Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers for precise position determination.
To handle the large volume of data generated by AVNIR-2 and PALSAR, ALOS will have mass storage on board.
The memories will have a storage capacity of 706 gigabits and a data-handling capability of 240 megabits per second.
Optical data recorders and solid-state memory recorders are the most probable equipment for the mass memories.
ALOS will also provide a high-data-rate transmission capability through the Data Relay Technology Satellites scheduled for launch before ALOS.
This will make it possible to receive ALOS data in real time for hazard monitoring.
38. PALSAR is the second Japanese spaceborne SAR which uses L-band frequency.
The instrument has three modes of observation, identified as fine resolution, ScanSAR, and low-data-rate modes.
The fine-resolution mode, a strip SAR, is a conventional mode, used mainly for detailed regional observations and repeat-pass interferometry.
The goal for this mode is to achieve 10 metres of spatial resolution, both in the range and azimuth directions, and 70 kilometres of swath width.
PALSAR will have another attractive observation mode, the ScanSAR mode, which will make it possible to image strips with widths of more than 250 kilometres by sacrificing spatial resolution.
This width is about three times wider than current SAR (e.g. Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1/SAR) images, and should be useful for determining the coverage of sea ice and rain-forest monitoring.
39. In the low-data-rate mode, data can be transmitted directly to ground stations using X-band frequency.
Because of narrow band width in the X-band downlink frequency, the maximum data rate in this band is limited to 120 megabits per second.
By sacrificing spatial resolution in range direction, dynamic range and swath width found in the fine-resolution mode, the observation data can be transmitted at either 120 or 60 megabits per second.
40. The PALSAR system will be jointly developed by NASDA and the Japan Resources Observation System (JAROS) organization.
NASDA is responsible for PALSAR integration and developing the antenna unit, including the radiation panels.
JAROS is responsible for the development of an electronics unit, as well as transmitting/receiving modules of the antenna unit.
C. Applications of radar remote sensing technology in the Philippines
41. In the Philippines, microwave remote sensing data are widely used by a number of government institutions and organizations, as well as by users in the private sector.
Activities in space technology development and in applications are coordinated by a multi-agency body called the Committee on Space Technology Applications, under the Science and Technology Coordinating Council (STCC).
STCC is a cabinet-level body chaired by the Department of Science and Technology, and serving as the highest science and technology policy-making body in the country.
1. Completed projects
42. The use of radar satellite data in the Philippines was spurred by the need to implement a programme for rehabilitation of areas in northern and central Luzon that had been severely damaged by the July 1990 earthquake.
This was known as the Earthquake Reconstruction Project.
The project was funded by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank, and jointly implemented by NAMRIA, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the Department of Public Works and Highways.
The project utilized SAR data provided by INTERA, a Canadian company, to assess earthquake damage and map potential geologic hazard zones.
43. Another project, entitled "Interpretation of SAR Data and Preparation of Geologic, Seismic Zonation, and Geohazard Maps for Portions of Luzon, Philippines", utilized interpretations of conventional aerial photographs, detailed geotechnical investigations and reviews of geologic and geophysical information, and combined them with interpretations of SAR data that had been collected by INTERA.
The project team included the participation of the private sector.
Among other very important outputs, the project team using SAR data prepared digital base maps showing drainage and transportation networks, and digitized available geological maps for all of Luzon.
SAR mosaics in the 1:100,000 scale were prepared and analysed to produce maps showing physiography, structures and lineaments.
44. These projects had a training component, in the form of intensive participation by local professionals in data review and analysis, field mapping, drilling, report writing, preparation of map layouts and hazard mapping.
Seminars on such topics as "engineering seismology" and "estimating characteristics of earthquake ground motions and evaluating liquefaction potential", a short training course on SAR data interpretation and field trips to selected study areas were also included.
45. With funding from the European Union, a number of projects using ERS-1 data were undertaken in 1994.
One of these is the project entitled, "Mount Pinatubo Environmental Degradation Assessment Using ERS-1 SAR Data", which produced land cover maps of Mount Pinatubo and vicinity.
This project was implemented by the University of the Philippines Training Center of Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry.
An integral part of the collaboration with ESA was the training component, which included a national radar training workshop for 32 persons from different government agencies and regions.
2. Ongoing projects 46. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has started a three-year project, entitled "Mitigation of Volcanic Hazards in the Philippines using ERS-1 Data".
Four active volcanoes, namely Pinatubo, Taai, Mayon and Ragang, were selected for investigation and monitoring of changes using the technique of interferometry.
Important outputs of this project consist of geologic and hazard maps, as well as knowledge of interferometric techniques.
The project is sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Union of Geological Sciences.
47. At present, two agencies are implementing projects in which Radarsat data are utilized.
NAMRIA is conducting a study to examine the feasibility of using Radarsat SAR data to produce orthoimages.
The project goal is production of a low-cost 1:100,000 orthoimage on the basis of fine-resolution (10-20 metres) data by designing and developing an appropriate digital elevation model.
Radarsat provides data only, while the Government of the Philippines, through NAMRIA, provides funding for the operating expenses and equipment.
48. The Bureau of Soils and Water Management is conducting a project entitled, "Flood Vulnerability Assessment of the Central Luzon Basin using Radarsat".
The project output will be presented in the form of monthly flood situation maps (1:250,000) for 1996 and 1997, pointing out flood duration, depth and spatial extent.
49. The objective of the study was to evaluate the capabilities of ERS-1 SAR data for monitoring rice-planting acreage and its growth.
The study area was about 100 square kilometres in the Tha Muang district, Kanchanaburi province, in western Thailand.
The rice-growing area was irrigated, flat, homogeneously managed, and had large individual fields, of at least 1 hectare each.
50. Multi-temporal ERS-1 SAR data were available on 12 acquisition dates, between November 1991 and December 1994.
The analysis of ERS-1 SAR data was supported by aerial photographs and a SPOT panchromatic image.
51. Within the study area, 10 sample areas of approximately 10 hectares each were selected for detailed backscattering studies of rice fields.
Extensive ground measurements were taken in conjunction with ERS-1 data acquisitions during the main growth period from August to December 1993.
Plant height, moisture content and plant density, the number and size of leaves, stalk net weight and the height of standing water were measured, along with more general observations of the state of the water and soil surface and plants, as well as weather conditions at acquisition time.
52. GPS was used to locate and register test-site boundaries and calculate the area of each test site.
The ERS-1 data were geometrically corrected using a topographic map at scale 1:50,000.
The field boundaries of all the surveyed test sites were digitized and superimposed on the geometrically corrected and filtered data.
The results of the study can be summarized as follows:
(a) Multi-temporal ERS-1 SAR data are highly suitable for rice-field mapping.
The achieved mapping accuracy in the study was 89 per cent for rice fields against any other land cover;
(b) At least three images should be available during the growth cycle.
The optimum acquisition dates are during the flooded vegetative phase, at the end of the reproductive phase and shortly before harvesting.
An additional post-harvest image may be useful for better discrimination from other land cover classes in the surrounding areas;
(c) The use of a pixel-based, standard maximum-likelihood classifier is sufficient, although more sophisticated methods may provide better results.
Speckle filtering of the input data is essential;
(d) Multi-temporal ERS-1 SAR data are highly suitable for rice-crop monitoring;
(e) The radar backscattering coefficient is well correlated with rice-plant height; consequently, the use of radar data allows determination of the approximate stage of plant growth;
(f) The radar signal shows a potential correlation with rice yield.
However, this relation may be indirect, assuming that radar backscattering is more sensitive to parameters such as biomass, moisture and geometry of rice plants rather than to grain yield itself;
(g) If an operational rice-monitoring system is developed, it is strongly recommended to include multi-temporal radar data as a primary data source.
E. Use of synthetic aperture radar data from the European Remote Sensing Satellite
for land-use and coastal zone monitoring in Indonesia
53. Indonesia is an archipelago country with approximately 17,000 islands and a coastline of more than 81,000 kilometres in length.
The coastal zone is a vital living space and an area of intense economic and social activity of great importance to the country.
Planning and management of land use and coastal resources should be based on a sound knowledge and understanding of the physical and biological processes involved.
Remote sensing data could be a very important source of information for that purpose.
In optical remote sensing, however, one of the major constraints that limits the use of this tool is cloud cover.
Microwaves are able to penetrate cloud cover and allow the monitoring of land use and coastal areas on a weather-independent basis.
54. The main objective of the project was to study the potential of ERS-1 SAR data to derive information that would be useful for land-use and coastal zone management.
The detailed objectives of the project included the following:
(a) Over land, to investigate the potential of ERS-1 SAR for mapping areas used for fish ponds, harbours, coastal infrastructures, settlements, rice fields and other land-use categories, and its relevance for coastal zone management;
(b) Over sea, to investigate the potential of ERS-1 for detecting oil spills, wave studies, underwater features and man-made objects in the sea;
(c) To compare the information content of ERS-1 SAR data with that of other remote sensing data;
(d) To integrate information derived from ERS-1 into coastal zone management models.
55. The study area was located along the northern coast of Central Java.
Three data sets of ERS-1 SAR data were available, acquired on 23 January, 16 February and 6 March 1994.
Analysis of the multi-temporal data was complemented by field observations and existing maps.
Both visual and digital analysis of ERS-1 SAR imagery was carried out.
56. The result of the study may be summarized as follows:
(a) Multi-temporal ERS-1 SAR images are very useful for land-use and coastal zone management, including monitoring of changes in the coastal land cover and coastline at high and low tide and detection of oil spills;
(b) Complementary use of multisource imagery (ERS-1 SAR, Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT), as well as application of multisensor data fusion techniques is recommended for more accurate interpretation and classification of data, especially with respect to land-use monitoring.
F. European Community/European Space Agency/Association of South-East Asian Nations project
57. In November 1992, the European Community, in partnership with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and with the technical support of ESA, embarked upon an ambitious project to upgrade remote sensing facilities in South-East Asia in order to assist the developing countries of the region in the development of microwave remote sensing programmes and applications of ERS-1 and NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data.
Such development was to be achieved through hardware and software upgrades for both ERS-1 and AVHRR data acquisition, processing and archiving and, in the case of ERS-1, through the establishment of a pilot project and training programme to be conducted over a two-and-a-half-year period.
The structure of the project comprised three elements: two bilateral agreements (with Thailand and Malaysia) aimed at providing the necessary hardware and software resources to support new developments in remote sensing within ASEAN; and one regional component addressing the pilot project and training needs required.
58. The European Community made available to the project a grant of 3.9 million European currency units (ECU), with an additional contribution of 1.52 million ECU from ESA in the form of data and training facilities.
59. Upgrading of existing acquisition facilities in support of ERS-1 in Thailand was completed, and operations commenced at the beginning of March 1993.
Since then, approximately 145 high-density digital tapes have been acquired, each one containing data from an average of three to four satellite passes.
In addition to the precision processor capable of producing a variety of ERS-1 products, the processing chain incorporated the first operational installation of a quicklook processor.
This processor enables even the longest passes to be processed to image form in less time than it takes to produce a single precision product.
The quicklooks so produced provide a valuable visualization within the cataloguing facility that is also provided as part of the overall system.
60. In Malaysia, an extension to the existing AVHRR acquisition facilities at the Malaysian Meteorological Service was made in order to include processing of higher-level products using the ESA-developed software packages.
Additional Universal Interface Terminal systems and stand-alone SAR geocoding systems were also installed.
61. Eight pilot projects were selected from the large number of proposals submitted and distributed between the four countries participating in the project (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand).
The pilot projects addressed applications issues that were of specific relevance to the South-East-Asian experience.
62. The pilot projects were:
(a) INDO-1: land-use assessment and monitoring using ERS-I SAR data;
(b) INDO-2: application of ERS-1 SAR data for coastal zone management;
(c) MAL-1: complementary nature of SAR and optical data for land cover mapping;
(d) MAL-2: coastal zone information from ERS-I SAR satellite data;
(e) PHIL-1: application of ERS-I SAR data to environmental degradation assessment in the Mount Pinatubo area;
(f) PHIL-2: application of ERS-1 SAR data in flood hazard assessment of fluvial and coastal environment;
(g) THAI-1: rice monitoring using ERS-l data in Thailand;
(h) THAI-2: application of ERS-1 SAR data for coastal studies in Khlung District, Thailand.
63. In support of the above-mentioned pilot projects, the project also provided an opportunity for appropriate training to the project personnel.
Training programmes also helped facilitate the dissemination of information among the participating countries on the capabilities of the relatively new technology of microwave remote sensing.
Extremely important within this element was the need to promote an awareness among high-level decision makers about the potential advantages to be gained from using remote sensing technologies, in particular, microwave applications in support of policy and other vital decisions.
The training programme of the European Community/ESA/ASEAN project was therefore structured into a series of layers, each targeted at a different audience:
(a) Seminars for decision makers. These were one-day events designed to provide both decision and policy makers with an overview of the possible application areas in which microwave data could be useful.
Each participating country hosted one of the events;
(b) Regional training workshops. These were for a period of two weeks each, introducing an audience of 24 researchers to the principles and practice of microwave remote sensing.
Each event addressed a different applications area.
64. In addition, provision was made for two researchers from each project to spend up to three weeks in Europe at facilities of the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) in order to address issues that were important to the ERS programme, and also at the partner institutes of their respective projects to work on pilot project data using hardware, software and expertise that may not be readily available within ASEAN.
65. In November 1995, the Project Advisory Board held a meeting which evaluated the project and discussed future trends of cooperation between the European Community/ESA and ASEAN.
The meeting concluded that most of the pilot projects had been successful, and other activities were completed as planned.
Participants at the meeting also discussed the problems experienced during implementation of the pilot projects.
G. Imagery distribution at SPOT Image
66. SPOT Image is a member of the ERS consortium and the distributor of ERS data for users in France and around the world (not including Europe and North America).
Singapore-based SPOT Asia, a subsidiary of SPOT Image, responds to SPOT and ERS data inquiries for customers in South-East Asia.
67. In order to understand user needs and to provide better technical advice to customers, SPOT Image undertook a certain number of projects on the application of ERS SAR data.
One of those activities was the analysis of ERS SAR data applications to determine which would have the highest potential in terms of relevance to regional user needs.
In collaboration with ESA/ESRIN, SPOT Image is currently conducting a comprehensive evaluation of SPOT-ERS data complementarity in European Community/ESA/ASEAN pilot projects in tropical and equatorial regions, with a particular focus on applications concerning cartography, interferometry and agriculture.
68. SPOT Image has also gained expertise in the use of microwave data in the preparation of maps on the basis of SAR data, in flood monitoring using SPOT and SAR imagery, in geocoding SPOT and ERS SAR data and in development of interferometric digital elevation models (DEM).
69. The use of combined SPOT and SAR imagery opens a door to many opportunities in the field of geographic information.
Complementarity of the data is due to the type of information delivered by each sensor as well as to the access to information over cloudy regions.
Multi-source data products can provide end-users with more accurate and reliable information on agriculture and crop area identification, deforestation monitoring, oil and mineral exploration and geological interpretation, flood monitoring and DEM production, as well as with more complete solutions for production of up-to-date geographic information.

Funds allocated by the co-sponsors of the Conference were used to cover the cost of international air travel, accommodation and daily subsistence allowance for 17 participants from Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Uruguay and Uzbekistan.
Conference facilities, equipment and local transportation for the field trip were provided by the Government of Spain through INTA.
9. The programme of the Conference was developed by INTA with input from the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA.
The programme consisted of numerous meetings and two round-table discussions.
The round-table discussions provided an opportunity for participants from developing countries to promote regional development and to promote new programmes of cooperation, as well as the development of this technology within their limited capacities.
INTA will issue the proceedings of the Conference.
10. The Conference was supplemented with technical visits to INTA headquarters and CASA.
At INTA, the participants heard a presentation by the Director-General of INTA on the Spanish satellite MINISAT 01 and toured the new ground control centre.
At CASA, the Director of International Relations gave a presentation on the contribution of CASA to the Ariane launchers and to different European satellites.
I. OBSERVATIONS OF THE CONFERENCE 11. With over 200 participants, the Conference reflected the growing interest in the use of small satellites for dedicated missions applied to everything from scientific Earth observation to demonstrations on technology.
Participants stressed on several occasions that such missions could be conducted quickly and inexpensively and could increase the opportunities for developing countries to gain access to space, which in turn would offer advantages related to the developmental and industrial aspects of space technology.
12. The Conference offered many opportunities to all attending specialists to exchange information, explore new concepts, encourage national, regional and international cooperation in mission planning and develop new collaborative relationships between individuals and institutions.
13. In the round-table discussions, participants from Jordan, Kenya, Peru, Sri Lanka, Uruguay and Uzbekistan highlighted the experiences and programmes of their countries in the development, within their capacities, of space technology.
Participants from China, Mexico and the Russian Federation presented either papers or poster displays.
14. Several informal proposals were discussed by participants from Kenya and Uganda and by participants from Ghana, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Jordan.
Most of those countries did not have microsatellite projects but might have them in the near future.
Several participants whose universities were participating in space projects shared their experiences and were ready to collaborate with persons from other countries in the development of space activities.
15. One of the major successes of the Conference was the substantial contribution from the space industry at the national and international levels.
The Conference brought participants in direct contact with representatives of the space industry, with whom they could discuss their projects.
A number of small satellites from countries with emerging space technologies had been built by foreign "providers" and adapted to their needs only during the last stages of preparation, sometimes even after they had been launched.
As a result, presentations by the major providers of launchers and small satellite buses attracted the most attention at the Conference.
Several companies approached participants from developing countries in order to obtain additional information on specific projects, such as the Satex I project of Mexico.
16. During the deliberations of the Conference and the field trip, it became evident that the commercialization of technology involving small satellites was an emerging trend.
Throughout the deliberations, speakers representing the industry emphasized that even though, when speaking of satellites, "small is beautiful", most of the space business was financed with government funds and the difficulty lay in convincing Governments that promoting projects in that field was a good long-term investment.
17. Recent technological progress had proved that small satellites could offer services that previously had been unavailable or had been available only on much larger spacecraft.
Sophisticated scientific and technological experiments (including experiments in the fields of space physics, astronomy, astrophysics and communications), technology demonstrations and projects designed to collect Earth resource data, including disaster information, could be carried out in space at modest costs.
18. Participants of the Conference were informed that the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session, held in February 1996, had recognized the importance of missions involving small satellites by including the issue in its programme as a special theme.
In addition, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), the International Council of Scientific Unions and the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) had organized, in liaison with States, a symposium on the theme "Utilization of micro- and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost space activities, taking into particular account the needs of developing countries", to complement discussions on the subject within the Subcommittee (A/AC.105/611 and A/AC.105/638).
19. It was stated that, owing to the success of the present Conference, the United Nations Programme on Space Applications would pay more attention to such technology.
The participants recommended that the Programme should place more emphasis on commercial aspects of the technology and begin a series of activities on the subject in every region.
That would facilitate and encourage future cooperation between industries in developed and developing countries.
In that way, the Programme would foster information exchange and collaboration in general mission-design work and in the actual development of small satellite technology. II. SUMMARY OF THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Ongoing programmes
20. It was stated that small satellites had already been flown with considerable success by many organizations; their attraction lay in the promise of low-cost and short development times made possible by the use of proven standard equipment and techniques, coupled with a realistic expectation of performance.
Such satellites made it possible for a country with even a small research budget and little or no experience with space technology to participate in their development, launching and operation.
Also, small satellites presented an opportunity for training students, engineers and scientists in different disciplines, including engineering, software development for on-board and ground computers and management of sophisticated technical programmes.
Definitions for small satellites varied, but most weighed below 400 kg, there being two main categories: small satellites (or "minisatellites"), weighing about 100-400 kg; and microsatellites, weighing less than 100 kg.
21. Spain had been one of the first countries to develop its own small satellite, INTASAT, which had been launched on 15 November 1974 by a United States Delta launcher.
INTASAT had weighed about 25 kg and had measured 45 centimetres in diameter, corresponding to what was currently called a microsatellite.
The satellite had been developed at INTA and had been used to measure space radiation.
With its solar batteries, it had functioned in an orbit of 1,450 km high for two full years.
After that, Spain had become involved in larger projects such as communication satellites in the HISPASAT series and had participated in different ESA projects.
On 7 July 1995, a second Spanish microsatellite, UPM-Sat 1, had been launched by an Ariane 4 rocket into a 650-km circular heliosynchronous orbit.
It had been developed at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and had a mass of 47 kg.
22. In 1992, a more complex Spanish space project, MINISAT, had been entrusted to INTA by CICYT.
Many papers presented at the Conference described various aspects of that ongoing project. Modular satellites 180-500 kg in mass (depending on the number of modules used) would be launched by Pegasus airborne launchers from the Canary Islands starting in December 1996.
The first satellite, MINISAT 01, would consist of the basic platform and would be used for scientific research.
MINISAT 1 would be an upgraded version, equipped for remote-sensing observations.
MINISAT 2 would use the basic platform to provide long-distance communications from the geostationary orbit.
In addition, INTA had recently become involved in the NanoSat programme, aimed at the development of a 20-kg microsatellite for communication with the Spanish scientific base Juan Carlos I in Antarctica.
23. A small satellite project in Argentina, Scientific Application Satellite B (SAC-B), was being prepared in cooperation with the United States for a Pegasus launch at the end of 1996.
The main purpose of the project was to design a satellite with a scientific payload to advance the study of solar physics and astrophysics.
The mass of the satellite was about 180 kg; its expected active lifetime minimum was three years.
It would have a circular orbit at 550 km and an inclination of 38 degrees.
Experiments concerning examination of energetic particles and radiation from solar flares, localization of sources of intense transient emissions of gamma ray radiation, monitoring of galactic and extragalactic X-ray diffuse background and examination of energetic neutral atoms in radiation belts (in cooperation with Italy) would be conducted on board.
SAC-C and SAC-D, representing a new generation of satellites for scientific research and remote sensing, were being prepared for launch in the period 1999-2006.
24. In Brazil, great significance was attached to the collection of data from remote platforms using space technology.
The Brazilian Complete Space Mission (MECB) had successfully started in February 1993 with the launch of the data collection satellite SCD 1.
The satellite had remained operational two years after its expected useful life.
At least two similar satellites would be launched to ensure continuity of the mission.
In addition, the improved SCD 3 satellite (200 kg) would also be used to prove the Brazilian concept of satellite voice and data communication services in the equatorial region.
25. The Advanced Interdisciplinary Communications Satellite (SACI-1), the first Brazilian microsatellite for scientific application, was to be launched in October 1997 as a piggyback with the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS).
The payload of SACI-1 was composed of four scientific experiments: the measurement of the Earth airglow emissions and the anomalous cosmic radiation fluxes, as well as the investigation of plasma bubbles and the geomagnetic field effect on charged particles.
The ground segment was to consist of two receiving stations in Brazil and of user ground data collecting stations.
A cost-effective local area network PC-based tracking and control system would be used and the scientific data and payload on-board configuration would be distributed through the Internet in order to decentralize and facilitate the interfacing between the payload and its customers.
26. In Chile, the first operational satellite would be FASat-Bravo, developed in cooperation with the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom.
The 46-kg microsatellite would be put into circular orbit at 650 km with an inclination of 82.5 degrees at the end of 1996.
It would carry an ozone layer monitoring experiment, data transfer experiment, experimental Earth imaging system and some other equipment, including an educational experiment.
Using the communications link provided by the satellite, students would be able to engage in study activities (orbital mechanics, satellite communications analysis and telemetry analysis) one or two days each month.
27. In Mexico, the SATEX microsatellite project consisted of a family of microsatellites with the objective of mobilizing human resources in space technology and developing test bed systems.
As part of a multi-institutional project supported by the Mexican Institute of Communications, the spacecraft would be launched by Arianespace as an auxiliary payload into a polar heliosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 800 km.
The goals of the SATEX 1 mission were, inter alia: (a) the development of a technologically advanced spacecraft in order to support scientific experiments; (b) the assessment of a general-purpose space bus to be utilized with minimal changes in future missions; (c) the exploitation of previous space experiments; (d) the integration of experienced professionals; and (e) the training of young researchers in the space field.
Mexico had announced the successful launch of its mini-satellite UNAM SAT B on 5 September 1996, a few days prior to the opening of the Conference.
28. The POSAT-1 remote sensing mission, a result of close cooperation between a Portuguese industrial consortium and the University of Surrey, was operating routinely.
It carried a range of communications, small-scale space science, technology demonstration and Earth observation payloads which, together with an enhanced bus system, made it one of the most sophisticated of the latest generation of microsatellites.
It had recently been used by the Portuguese Ministry of Defence to communicate with army units in different parts of the world (e.g. Angola and Bosnia and Herzegovina).
B. Small mission uses 29. Conventional Earth observation and remote-sensing satellite missions were extremely costly, typically costing over $200 million each.
The development of high-density two-dimensional semi-conductor charged-couple device (CCD) optical detectors, coupled with low-power consumption microprocessors, presented a new opportunity for remote sensing by using inexpensive satellites.
The limited mass, volume, stability and optics of microsatellites could not compete with traditional large-scale missions such as the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT), Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) and the European remote sensing satellite (ERS); however, for medium resolution and meteorological-scale imaging, the KITSAT and POSAT satellites had demonstrated a comparable facility but at a tiny fraction of the cost.
That aspect was attractive to developing countries interested in having an independent remote-sensing capability, albeit with limited resolution, that could be under their direct control.
30. Many developing countries had had early access to satellite remote sensing but still had a long way to go in order to maximize the benefits made possible by the existing capabilities.
There were unique needs at the national and regional levels that demanded new solutions.
Brazil and the Republic of Korea were already developing new satellite programmes to address their specific needs.
Developing countries in Latin America, south-east Asia and other regions required special sensor parameters such as spectral bands, spatial resolution and time resolution; they also needed advice regarding cost of image and investment level in ground equipment.
31. The French space agency CNES had created a working group on small satellites at the end of 1993 to propose recommendations for the development of a series of small satellites complementing the SPOT system, at a cost less than 300 million French francs per mission and with a development time of two years.
The recommended programme was called Plateforme reconfigurable pour l'observation, les télécommunications et les usages scientifiques (PROTEUS).
The first flight was envisioned for 1999 as a continuation of the successful French-United States altimetric satellite project Topex-Poséidon.
32. It was stated that telemedicine was an application that would increase the efficiency of medical services by allowing the transmission of information obtained by inexpensive and simple sensors directly to complex processing units in large medical centres, where it could be interpreted by specialized physicians.
That would make it possible for powerful and effective emergency services to reach poor and undeveloped areas, saving many lives and avoiding unnecessary displacement of patients.
The Healthsat project was a good example of telemedicine application, using a 60-kg microsatellite in a low Earth orbit (LEO) to relay medical data between Nigeria and countries in North America.
Mobile communications could also play an important role in the event of natural disasters, enabling help to reach disaster victims sooner and providing logistical support to rescue teams.
C. Industrial aspects
33. It was stated that the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom had pioneered microsatellite technologies since beginning its UOSAT programme in 1979.
The need to accommodate a variety of payload customers within a standard Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP) launcher envelope, coupled with increased demands on packing density, economy of manufacture and ease of integration, had led to the development of a novel modular design of a multimission platform.
It was based around a series of standard module trays that housed the electronic circuits and themselves formed the mechanical structure onto which solar arrays were mounted.
The microsatellite used modern, sophisticated, but not necessarily space-proven, electronic circuits to provide a high degree of capability.
The circuits were underpinned by space-proven subsystems resulting in a layered architecture that achieved redundancy by using alternative technologies rather than by simple duplication.
34. Missions being considered by the Small Mission Opportunity (SMO) initiative of ESA might be classified by the parameters of a launch mass of 150-500 kg, an orbit of between 600 and 900 km, a development time of about two years and a cost of less than 40 million European currency units for platform and integration, delivery on orbit, commissioning and user ground station.
It was a class of small missions generating a lot of interest where the European industry was not as competitive as it was in the microsatellite field.
Various ESA member States had flown, were developing or were planning small missions.
With few exceptions, those missions had involved or would involve the development of a single spacecraft.
If more spacecraft should be realized, it would happen in intervals of 3-4 years.
35. The basic idea of the SMO initiative was to have a common procurement of part or all of the mission elements of launch, platform integration and ground segment.
That approach should achieve the low-cost benefits for such recurrent elements of the mission while preserving the user's control over the mission payload and operations.
The possibility of efficiently integrating a number of different missions on a common subset of equipment had already been demonstrated by various small satellite programmes, such as the NASA Small Explorer programme.
Actual contents of the SMO initiative would be defined after an analysis of the proposed mission requirements, which would be performed in the second phase of the ongoing studies.
At present, the launch opportunity seemed to be the strongest common denominator.
36. States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were having a difficult time with respect to the space industry.
Whereas the Russian Federation could offer ground segment services and launchers and Ukraine was developing some launcher capability, there was only limited experience in the field of small satellites.
The tradition of heavy, complex spacecraft would be difficult to overcome in the near future.
In Kazakstan and Uzbekistan, where there was a considerable concentration of the intellectual and industrial potential in space technology, there had recently been a lack of strategic planning on how to use those capabilities.
In addition, with a considerable decrease in demand, many specialists had left the country, leading to a further deterioration in the situation.
37. One of the successful Russian small satellite missions was the communication system GONETS, intended for digital e-mail services.
The first two demonstration satellites had been orbited in 1993 by the Tsiklon launcher.
The mass of each satellite was 250 kg, and it would be possible to launch up to six satellites by a single launcher into a 1,500-km orbit with an inclination of 83 degrees.
Currently, there were several projects in the Russian Federation for the creation of a constellation of small communication satellites.
Signal, a low-orbit system, would consist of 12 satellites (300 kg each) in four orbital planes; a Courier-1 system would consist of 8-12 satellites (each with a mass of 250 kg) launched into a circular 700-km orbit inclined 76 degrees; and the Globsat system had been proposed for a 30-66 satellite constellation.
There were also several projects for universal small space platforms (USSP-1, USSP-2 and USSP-3).
Their mass would be from 60 to 400 kg and they could be used to carry radio equipment for the International Search and Rescue System (COSPAS-SARSAT).
38. A multipurpose small satellite platform was also being developed in China by experts from the Chinese Academy of Space Technology.
It should satisfy servicing for small remote sensors, CCD cameras, scientific experimental instruments, experimental communications and new technology test payloads.
The service system electronic module was a box measuring about 110 x 120 x 50 cm and it contained attitude control, an integrated house-keeping management unit, electrical power and a propulsion module.
Its mass was about 250-350 kg, which included 100-150 kg of useful payload.
The energy was provided by solar arrays combined with a nickel cadmium chemical battery.
Initial stabilization after orbital injection was achieved by spinning up the whole satellite.
After solar acquisition was achieved, the control mode should be switched to the Sun-pointing spin-stabilized mode and then, if required, to the full three-axis, Earth-pointing stabilized mode.
The platform should be available in a few years time.
D. Launchers and the ground segment
39. It was stated that the cost of available launchers was limiting the current and future development of small satellites.
Currently, the most common practice was to have small satellites ride piggyback on large payloads (e.g. Ariane 4, Russian Cosmos or Zenit launchers).
Of the major European and United States small launchers, only Pegasus and Taurus were flight-proven. Spain was preparing a test flight of its new Capricornio launcher; the development of the San Marco Scout of Italy had not yet started (although its forerunner, the United States Scout, had been operational for many years) and the Ariane-5 derivative programme should be completed in 1999.
Because of the lack of competition in the market, the cost of launching was usually a substantial portion of the overall cost of the mission.
40. Launch access for small satellites could be obtained either on a purely commercial basis or by participating in international cooperative agreements.
A country might also consider developing its own launch capability.
A driving force in pursuing that approach was the lack of available low-cost launchers and the inability of a country to meet launch requirements on a timely basis if it viewed access to space as critical to its national development.
The acquisition of launch services from international commercial sources was sometimes preferable to cooperative arrangements, owing to difficulties in finding an appropriate exchange opportunity.
In particular, countries seeking their first launch might find a commercial acquisition the most effective route open to them.
41. It was noted that requirements for the ground segment of a small satellite system varied enormously depending on the application area.
At one extreme, low data rate sensors with only local or regional coverage on missions with low tracking and command requirements would impose relatively low demands on the ground segment, possibly comprising only 10 per cent or less of the total programme cost.
More complex data retrieval and processing requirements could result in ground segment costs accounting for up to 50 per cent.
Assuming that ground segment costs tended to average 25 per cent of the programme total, it was clearly important to identify potential savings in the ground segment in concert with those of the space segment.
E. International cooperation and legal aspects
42. Based on the deliberations of the Conference, the success of the new emerging technology would depend on the way missions were planned, specified, realized, funded and operated.
Opportunities were available at the national, regional and international levels for cooperation to acquire advanced technologies and upgrade technical expertise in new fields.
Small satellite systems could provide an opportunity to invest limited resources and to gradually increase a national infrastructure.
43. One of the major outcomes of the Conference was the official announcement of a cooperation agreement between Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Spain to develop a minisatellite for Earth observation.
Its specific applications were still to be defined.
The satellite would be ready for launch in the year 2000.
The programme of the agreement was in the process of being defined.
44. Cooperative missions might be considered when a clear programmatic benefit was shared by two or more countries with a mutual desire to maximize their unique national resources and available funding.
International cooperative agreements varied from mission to mission and from country to country; most required each country to assume full financial and technical responsibility for its portion of the cooperative effort.
In addition, clean and distinct managerial and technical interfaces should be detailed in such agreements.
45. Small satellite projects were often carried out in close international cooperation that was dictated by the need to share some technology and sometimes even the launchers.
Usually, partners provided financial input with respect to the construction, integration, testing and operation of individual instruments in return for participation in the mission and in the analysis and publication of the results.
An alternative method of participation was to provide another instrument, or instruments, for the payload, with the capability of performing unique research, together with sufficient financial backing or technical facilities for necessary integration, testing and operational activities.
46. Cooperative space activities were usually supported by some kind of technology transfer.
A successful technology transfer in the development of the small satellite project implied a process by which a team acquired sufficient momentum to be able to produce the next generation of small satellites.
There were several mechanisms whereby technology transfer could be achieved, but to be successful, the transfer should be a transfer of understanding and not just the transfer of a technology package ("know-why" as well as know-how).
There were examples of programmes where engineers from developing countries were trained on small satellite design, production and operations.
The University of Surrey had provided such assistance in the development of small satellites under 100 kg to Chile, Pakistan, Portugal and the Republic of Korea and even to small countries in Europe that had decided to initiate a space programme.
47. Several papers were devoted to the legal problems connected with the exploration of outer space and the practical use of space technology.
Two papers presented by the Office for Outer Space Affairs described problems of the official registration of objects launched into space (in particular, small satellites prepared in cooperation with several countries) and the danger of pollution in outer space by debris created during the launching and subsequent deployment and exploitation of the constellations of many small satellites in low orbits.
Also described were activities of the Office aimed at the promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.

In its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, the General Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82).
In that resolution, the Assembly decided that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should, among other things, disseminate, through panel meetings and seminars, information on new and advanced technology and applications, with emphasis on their relevance and implications for developing countries.
The United Nations/European Space Agency (ESA)/Chile Workshop on Space Technology to Prevent and Mitigate the Effects of Disasters was one of the activities of the Programme for 1996, which was endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995.
The Workshop was held at Santiago from 1 to 5 July 1996 in cooperation with the Government of Chile for participants from developing countries of the region covered by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
The Workshop, which was one of the follow-up activities of the Pro Tempore Secretariat of the Second Space Conference of the Americas (Santiago, 26-30 April 1993) to the recommendations made by that Conference, was hosted on behalf of the Government by four entities: the Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores; the Oficina Nacional de Emergencia of the Ministerio del Interior (ONEMI); the Comité de Asuntos Espaciales de Chile; and the Fuerza Aérea de Chile.
The objectives of the Workshop were as follows: (a) to expose the participants, particularly the managers of emergency response agencies, to ways and means by which space technology could be utilized to prevent or mitigate the effects of disasters; (b) to address the development of databases and their use with the Geographic Information System (GIS) to prevent disasters or to mitigate their effects when they occur; and (c) to recommend appropriate actions that could be undertaken through international cooperation to strengthen the emergency response capabilities of the region.
The participants have reported to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.
Most participants in the Workshop were professionals with several years of management experience with national and regional emergency response agencies and services.
Other participants had experience in remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite communications and broadcasting, electronic networking and the use of databases such as those integrated into GIS.
The Workshop was attended by 289 experts from 21 Member States and 11 international and regional organizations; 240 of them represented 17 countries of the ECLAC region: Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela; Nuova Telespazio (Italy), NEC Corporation (Japan), Spain, United States of America, European Commission, ESA, Earth Observation Satellite Company, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), Caribbean Telecommunications Union, Inter-American Development Bank; and, from the United Nations system, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA were used to defray the cost of air travel and provide an allowance for the incidental expenses of 27 participants and speakers from 17 countries and 2 regional organizations.
The Government of Chile, through the entities mentioned in paragraph 3, provided room and board for these same participants as well as the conference room, other meeting facilities and local transportation for all participants.
Opening addresses were made by the Secretary of the Pro Tempore Secretariat of the Second Space Conference of the Americas, the Director of ONEMI, the representative of ESA, the representative of the Office for Outer Space Affairs and the Minister of National Planning of Chile.
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing, satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking, satellite meteorology, satellite positioning systems and how they could be used, separately or in combination, to prevent, warn, monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding, drought, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Niño.
They also covered the wide range of activities being conducted by national, regional and international institutions to upgrade preparedness and capacity of response in the event of a disaster.
The programme for the Workshop was developed jointly by the United Nations, ESA and the Chilean organizations concerned.
The Workshop was conducted in the form of plenary and working group meetings.
The working group focused on the needs of emergency response services, the ability of space technology to satisfy those needs and the actions that would be necessary in the short- and medium-term to take advantage of that ability.
The Workshop made a number of recommendations and concluded with the signing of the Ibero-American Declaration of Joint Action for the Comprehensive Development of Civil Defence and Protection (annex) by representatives of the emergency services of 11 countries in Latin America and of Spain.
At the Workshop, the participants discussed issues related to the use of space technologies to prevent and combat the effects of natural disasters and concluded the meetings with the observations and recommendations presented below.
A. Observations The Workshop noted that the damage caused by natural phenomena to people and to productive infrastructures had steadily risen since the 1960s.
There were strong indications that that trend would continue.
Disasters had set back development agendas and could destabilize social and political structures.
While industrialized countries suffered greater economic damage in absolute terms, developing countries were impacted more severely in relative terms.
Also, the loss of human life due to natural disasters was greater, in absolute terms, in developing countries.
The participants indicated that disaster management was a development activity.
While responsibility for disaster preparedness and management lay with both the public and private sectors, protecting the country in the event of disasters remained a duty of the State.
However, that duty should not be borne only by ministries of health or defence, which were most effective in a response mode.
To promote the reduction of disaster vulnerability, it was necessary to also involve educators, researchers, urban planners, financial policy makers, those involved in the preparation of industrial or housing blueprints and, in general, the institutions that shaped the future of a country.
The Workshop recognized that disaster emergency response agencies and services in the region made limited use of the potentials of space technology for the prevention and management of disasters and their effects.
The potentials indicated below were among the most important.
Satellites could provide communications services independently of the local telecommunications infrastructure, making them ideally suited for disaster emergency and relief work.
The development of mobile or transportable satellite terminals would allow rapid deployment of emergency communications systems in disaster-affected areas.
Such terminals also offered an important means of rapid dissemination of information warning of impending or possible disasters.
Anticipated developments in global fixed and mobile satellite communications and broadcasting systems, using both geostationary and non-geostationary orbits, would greatly enhance the possibilities of support for disaster warning and relief mitigation efforts.
The future availability of truly global personal communications and broadcasting services at affordable prices would enable emergency response services to routinely use voice communication, digital data transfer and paging in all phases of disaster management activities.
At the international level, organizations concerned with national emergency planning, such as civil defence units and police and fire brigades, were increasingly incorporating satellite communications into their disaster relief plans.
Over 150 international disaster relief organizations were using International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat) terminals to enhance their work.
In addition to its standard services, INTELSAT also offered the Intelnet service, which could be used for environmental monitoring networks and disaster relief.
The economies of many developing countries were small and relatively specialized, leaving them particularly vulnerable to natural hazards.
At the same time, the capacity to prepare for and respond to natural and man-made hazards was minimal in many of those countries.
The wide array of remote sensing information technologies could provide cost-effective means for collecting information about the Earth's surface and for assessing a variety of environmental impacts.
The Workshop noted that remote sensing satellites were used to observe, map and monitor features and phenomena on the Earth's surface in the optical, infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
These satellites were differentiated from meteorological satellites by their higher spatial resolution (10-100 m) and their lower temporal resolution (typically, two weeks).
However, if the sensors could take images of points located off the satellite nadir ground track, their temporal resolution could be much better (three days) than the actual revisit time of the satellite.
Meteorological satellites provided images of cloud location and motion from which information to generate extreme-weather warnings could be derived.
The images were also used to study and monitor volcanoes, geology, icebergs, ice-fields, fire and flooding.
Low-resolution instruments provided valuable data for indirectly estimating rainfall, drought and locust infestations.
Meteorological satellites were also used to carry instruments for search-and-rescue purposes.
The International Search and Rescue Satellite System (COSPAS/SARSAT) was able to receive distress signals and transmit location details of downed aircraft and ships that had capsized or gone adrift to the nearest of an international network of rescue centres.
COSPAS/SARSAT had so far saved the lives of more than 4,600 persons.
Countries often faced similar disasters or even the same ones when the disasters were of a transnational nature.
Thus, managers of disaster-related programmes needed to maintain a fluid, continuous and informal dialogue, both within and across the borders.
The Internet made it possible for individuals and agencies to keep in touch following face-to-face meetings or formal communications.
The participants emphasized that the costs, in both human and financial terms, associated with losses caused by disasters were of a very large magnitude and that investments should be made, particularly at the national level, to prevent or minimize the effects of these events.
The participants concluded that the use of space technologies and other modern technologies could greatly enhance preparedness and capacity of response when disasters occurred.
However, to benefit from those technologies, it would be necessary to enhance or develop programmes to educate and train professionals to use them in the emergency response services and agencies; to promote the sharing of international experience and information on the use of the technology; and to identify, upgrade and link disaster-related databases.
In discussing the recommendations presented below, the participants took note of the recommendations related to disaster management that had been made by the participants at the United Nations/European Space Agency Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development and Communications, held at Puerto Vallarta in 1995 (A/AC.105/622).
B. Recommendations The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region, in collaboration with outside entities, should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications, remote sensing, global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention, early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters.
Any such mechanism should facilitate the exchange of information across sectors and disciplines and make it possible for individual civil defence institutions to receive technical advice on the specific equipment required and on the education and training needed to utilize it in their work.
There was a need for education and training programmes designed specifically for civil defence managers and staff.
Programmes for managers should be able to review the potentials of space technologies and should include criteria to select appropriate technologies.
Programmes for individuals at the working level should teach both fundamentals and practical aspects of selected technologies.
The Workshop recommended that short- and medium-term pilot projects to demonstrate the value of space technology in meeting the needs of managers of disaster agencies should be identified and implemented.
These projects should first of all strengthen on-going initiatives such as those that were presented at the Workshop, including the inventory on risk assessment that is being conducted by countries from the Andean Group in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO); the establishment of a centre to utilize space technologies for disaster management being developed by ONEMI; the integrated coastal area management system for small island developing States of the Caribbean proposed by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in collaboration with ESA and Nuova Telespazio; and the coordination of an emergency plan for Central America.
It is particularly important for every country to prepare risk assessment maps for specific disasters.
Where groups of countries are exposed to the same type of disaster(s), efforts should be made to build databases that can be accessed by all of them.
In respect of design and development of disaster warning systems, the Workshop recommended as follows:
(a) Space technology should be used for forecast and immediate warning systems in the event of flash floods due to heavy rain run-off from mountains;
(b) Early warning functions need to be linked to risk assessment and preparedness programmes within a coherent disaster management strategy;
(c) Continued research and development on the technical specifications of early warning systems should be carried out for explicit user-determined needs and applications;
(d) More attention should be paid to different international and national perspectives on what warning systems can do, technically, and what they need to do, practically.
A disaster-oriented home page should be created and its address on the World Wide Web should be extensively disseminated.
Alternatively, information could be placed in established web sites (for example, ReliefWeb) and made available in CD-ROM versions.
National and local governments should rationalize a strategy for funding disaster management planning.
Such a strategy must include a significant commitment on the part of these governments to support the costs of essential technological and human infrastructure building.
Although expensive in the short term, such an investment will result in much larger savings in both financial and human terms in the long term.
Donor governments and international funding agencies can then be approached for support in the form of technical assistance, education, training and, when necessary, financing.
The Third Space Conference of the Americas (4-8 November 1996, at Punta del Este, Uruguay) was expected to be a valuable means for pursuing the goals of this Workshop.
Related recommendations made by the Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development and Communications, held at Puerto Vallarta and by this Workshop, as well as those made by the Third Space Conference of the Americas, should be reviewed together to develop a strategic and coordinated follow-up plan.
This procedure would reduce the duplication of efforts and provide for continuity.
Over the last 25 years, the damage caused by natural phenomena to people and national productive infrastructures has steadily risen.
Economic damage has more than tripled, from US$ 40 billion in the 1960s to US$ 140 billion in the 1980s.
There are strong indications that this trend will continue.
Natural disasters, like complex emergencies, absorb increasing amounts of global resources and set back development agendas.
Before 1987, only one disaster had exceeded US$ 1 billion in insured losses.
Since then, 13 more such disasters have occurred.
Besides causing human and economic losses, disasters also can destabilize social and political structures.
While industrialized countries suffer greater economic damage in absolute terms, developing countries are impacted more severely in relative terms.
The gross national product (GNP) lost as a result of natural disasters is estimated to be 20 times greater in developing countries than in industrialized countries.
Also, deaths from natural disasters are more frequent in developing countries.
Japan, for example, averages 63 deaths per year from natural disasters; Peru, with similar natural hazards and only one sixth the population of Japan, averages 2,900 deaths per year.
The factors that make countries vulnerable to disasters increase in dimension much faster than the ability of governments to control them.
For many disaster-prone countries that have to contend with competing demands on scarce resources, vulnerability reduction programmes are considered an important, integral part of their development strategies.
However, the options and resources available to them for this purpose are often very limited.
Disasters are often the trade-off for ignoring environmentally sustainable development practices.
Yet, the connection between disasters and poor development practices is often not made.
Only gradually are a growing number of emergency management professionals becoming aware that disasters are often unsolved development problems.
Each year building codes are ignored and zoning laws overlooked as communities expand into areas prone to earthquakes, landslides, floods, tidal surges, droughts, volcanic eruptions and high winds.
Poverty, lack of education and overpopulation, all obvious root causes, need to be addressed for a realistic approach to disaster reduction.
Traditionally, disasters are classified as either natural or man-made.
As far as disaster relief is concerned, the classification into sudden onset disasters and complex emergencies is more appropriate, as it is less the cause of the disaster than the sequence of events that dictates the response to it.
On the one hand, an outbreak of civil strife can be as sudden as a volcanic eruption, and so are most technological or industrial disasters.
On the other, a drought is in most cases a slowly developing event and its consequences (e.g. the displacement of populations and civil unrest) can be highly complex.
Local response is, for reasons of time and location, the first element of relief in practically all cases.
No national or international assistance can replace that of the local emergency services.
National authorities have the primary overall responsibility for disaster prevention, preparedness and response as well as for mitigation.
Whenever local resources are not sufficient, intervention on the national level is required.
It is only where this second level does not have the necessary response capacity that international assistance is mobilized.
While emergency communications at the local and national levels can pose enormous problems, the need for satellite communications is most evident at the third, or international, level.
New technologies, particularly in data gathering and communication, have advanced the predictability of potentially destructive natural phenomena.
The technical ability to foresee and interpret hazards is no longer as limited as it once was.
Modern communications technologies provide wider and quicker access to information.
However, while this technical ability remains essential, it is not sufficient.
Early warning is not a disaster preparedness measure in itself.
It takes a functioning disaster preparedness system to translate early warning signals into an understandable message for the end users.
Although technological improvements have increased the capacity of early warning systems, they have also widened the gap between the alert message and the end users in developing, disaster-prone countries.
The discrepancy lies in the often highly technical content of the warning itself and in the ability of communities in disaster-prone areas to, firstly, understand it and, secondly, act in a pre-established manner.
This is particularly important in countries with different languages and local dialects.
Three abilities constitute the basis of early warning.
The first, largely a technical ability, is the identification of a potential risk (i.e. the likelihood of occurrence of a hazardous phenomenon).
The second is the accurate determination of the population to whom a warning needs to be directed.
The third, which requires considerable social and cultural awareness, is the communication of information to specific recipients about the threat in sufficient time and with enough clarity so that they can act to avert negative consequences.
B. Satellite communications and broadcasting for disaster management To the extent that public networks exist and survive the impact of disasters they are used in relief operations.
However, because they are so highly centralized, if one vital element is damaged, communications with the outside world can be completely disrupted.
Technology has enabled such widespread access to telecommunications that if a network fails, very many people are affected.
Moreover, each communications failure is likely to have critical effects on vital establishments such as hospitals.
In addition to wire communications systems and terrestrial microwave systems, Japan utilizes a network known as the Local Authorities Satellite Communications network (LASCOM) for protection against disasters and for emergency services during disasters.
In non-emergency conditions, the network is used for administrative purposes.
The usefulness of satellite communications was validated during the Kobe earthquake of January 1995, when terrestrial communications became vulnerable.
Another problem in the past was that the efforts of humanitarian organizations to deploy supporting telecommunications equipment such as radios and satellite communications have sometimes been hampered at national borders owing to lack of prior customs clearance.
The Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in its resolution 36 of October 1994, urged member States to take all practical steps for facilitating the rapid deployment and the effective use of telecommunications equipment for disaster mitigation and for disaster relief operations by reducing and, where possible, removing regulatory barriers.
Humanitarian organizations are major users of state-of-the-art mobile telecommunications technology.
Five of the largest institutions, three of them based in Geneva, use more than 250 mobile satellite terminals and thousands of two-way radios and short-wave transmitters and receivers.
National and international relief organizations and rescue teams worldwide, both governmental and non-governmental, make widespread use of various types of telecommunications equipment.
The Department of Humanitarian Affairs is responsible for facilitating the work of the operational partners in humanitarian assistance.
As the five major organizations spend over US$ 6 million per year on communications fees for satellite terminals alone, the Department and its Working Group on Emergency Telecommunications are also working towards reduced tariffs for humanitarian operations.
C. Use of satellite-based telemedicine in disaster relief Telemedicine has not been institutionalized as a routine practice and until recently applications in this field have typically been of short duration.
Further, there has been only scarce validation of telemedical systems in the variety of settings and situations that would be required to satisfy a cautious and, sometimes, skeptical medical community.
What has given the health applications of satellite technology the dramatic attention they receive today is certainly not newly discovered needs.
Rather, it is the rapid improvement in telecommunications and information technology and the realization that low-cost, easy-to-access and easy-to-use systems are available.
Continuous development of telemedicine by the military has resulted in a tremendous improvement in the way medical support is provided to military personnel in the field.
Although the benefits of this development have often been used to assist civilian casualties of natural disasters and complex emergencies, they deserve much wider application in primary and public health interventions.
During the recent outbreak of the Ebola virus in Zaire, a low Earth-orbiting satellite (HealthSat-2) operated by SateLife, a non-profit organization with headquarters at Boston, was used for a very basic yet important telemedicine application.
A group of doctors near the town of Kikwit used a SateLife ground station for store-and-forward e-mail communications with colleagues outside the affected area.
The doctors used another SateLife service, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), to exchange information and request medical equipment.
The ability of remote sensing satellites to map geological and geomorphological features is of immense help in identifying earthquake-prone areas.
Even though the science of earthquake and volcano prediction is in its infancy, the possibility of measuring small tectonic movements using laser ranging techniques or the differential Global Positioning System (GPS), combined with temperature measurements on the surface, is promising.
Earth observation satellites provide unique data to monitor Earth surface phenomena.
The damage caused by recurrent floods can be mitigated by using remote sensing data on different types of terrain and surface water areas to classify different risk zones in flood-prone areas.
As these data also provide information on wet areas, standing water, sand-covered areas, agricultural land that is completely damaged, marooned villages, canal systems and drainage patterns, they can help in taking appropriate measures to mitigate the sufferings of affected people and in making reliable estimates of damage.
The first satellite of the European Remote Sensing Programme (ERS-1) was launched in 1991 and carries several microwave sensors on board.
Its primary instrument is an active microwave instrument (AMI), which can provide both high-resolution images (in C-band) and wind speed (by analysing ocean wave spectra).
While in the imaging mode, AMI covers a swath of 80-100 km, with a resolution on the order of 27 m in the range direction and 29 m in the azimuth direction.
Operating in the wind mode, it covers a swath of 400-500 km over the ocean with resolution cells of 50 km and measures wind speed in the range 4-24 m/s with an accuracy of 0.5-2.0 m/s.
ERS-1 also carries a radar altimeter (RA) that operates at a wavelength of 2 cm.
RA is used to measure average wave height and wind speed and to determine meso-scale ocean topography.
Data from this altimeter have been used successfully to determine ice type and topography as well as water/ice boundaries.
A third instrument on board ERS-1 is an along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR) that operates in three bands in the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM).
These bands are centred around 3.7, 11 and 12 µm.
The ATSR looks through the atmosphere at the surface of the ocean from two directions: directly downwards and at an incidence angle of 50°.
The difference between the oblique and vertical measures provides information on atmospheric absorption, while the differences between measurements at the three wavelengths are used to determine atmospheric water vapour content.
The second satellite of the European Remote Sensing Programme (ERS-2) was launched on 21 April 1995 and is placed in the same orbit as ERS-1, following it by 31 minutes.
As the satellites are being operated in tandem, ERS-2 can visit a site 24 hours after ERS-1.
Such an arrangement allows interferometric analysis that produces digital elevation models of the terrain being imaged with a precision of centimetres.
In addition to the instruments carried by its predecessor, ERS-2 also carries global ozone monitoring equipment (GOME).
However, the ATSR instrument on board ERS-2 operates in the visible portion of the EM.
Although originally designed for ocean and ice applications, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained by ERS-1 and ERS-2 have been tested, with varying degrees of success, in agriculture, forestry, hydrology, cartography and geology applications and for monitoring natural hazards such as floods and mud flows.
Near coastlines, SAR images have also found applications in aquaculture, mangrove forestry and coastal monitoring.
As such, they have become valuable as data gathering satellites to support environmental monitoring and sustainable development programmes.
The ENVISAT-1 satellite is envisioned as an enhancement of the European Remote Sensing Programme.
However, in addition to contributing to environmental studies, this satellite will be an important tool for marine biology and atmospheric chemistry studies.
Its instruments will include advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR), a global ozone monitoring by occultation of stars (GOMOS) instrument, a medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS), a Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding (MIPAS), a radar altimeter (RA-2) and an advanced ATSR.
The likelihood of a landslide occurring is assessed by identifying critical combinations of site conditions, such as soil characteristics, degree of slope, type of bedrock, vegetative cover and rainfall and snow-melt conditions, that correlate well with the past occurrence of landslides.
Remote sensing satellites, because of their synoptic and stereoscopic viewing capabilities, together with aerial remote sensing, are very effective in determining these features.
Potential health disasters can also be identified using space technology.
A pilot project that addressed a potential health disaster caused by malaria-carrying mosquitos was carried out as a cooperative effort between the Centro de Investigación del Paludismo, Mexico, and several teaching institutions in the United States of America, with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States.
The project, conducted in the state of Chiapas, illustrated the complementary nature of space-based communications, global positioning, remote sensing and GIS.
This project used remote sensing and GIS technologies to discriminate between villages at high and low risk for malaria transmission, as determined by landscape characteristics that were correlated to the probable future abundance of Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes.
Satellite data for an area in southern Chiapas were digitally processed to generate a map of landscape elements.
GIS processes were used to correlate mapped landscape elements surrounding 40 villages where field data had been collected determining the abundance of Anopheles albimanus.
The analysis indicated that rainfall and growth of vegetation could be correlated with mosquito production; that changes in these parameters could be monitored and quantified by remote sensors; and that changes in mosquito populations could, accordingly, be predicted.
Using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1985 and 1987, the project team predicted, with an accuracy of 90 per cent, which rice fields would become heavy producers of malaria-carrying mosquitoes two months before peak mosquito production.
In the United States, TM multispectral data allowed monitoring forest fires in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (1988), and in Laguna Beach, California (1993).
The 16-day repeat coverage of Landsat allowed resource managers to develop a chronology of events related to the fires, useful in planning future fire-suppression activities and in developing a better understanding of forest fire dynamics.
TM data were also used to monitor reforestation efforts that included planting more than 18 million new trees after the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington (1980).
The Foreign Agricultural Service of the United States Department of Agriculture routinely uses data from Landsat, Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS), satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) and other satellites to monitor crop conditions worldwide, focusing on drought areas.
The Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), created in the early 1980s, uses Landsat data with advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and other types of data to monitor famine conditions.
Private farming concerns utilize a combination of remote-sensed data to watch for the beginning of crop infestation and take early remedial action.
Satellite remote sensing data have also been used in many countries to monitor man-made disasters such as nuclear power accidents, ground and water pollution, deforestation, biomass degradation, oil spills and water shortages.
In all these cases, periodic satellite coverage allowed monitoring the progress of the subsequent mitigation or corrective actions.
The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies has proposed that the Global Disaster Observation System (GDOS) could be established through international cooperation.
It would use the capabilities of existing satellite systems, supplemented by those of new satellite systems for situations where the existing systems cannot meet the needs.
The main objective of GDOS would be to minimize damage in large-scale disasters.
It would operate in tandem with conventional disaster prevention systems and would be able to do the following:
(a) Provide detailed, near-real-time information on disasters to enable effective deployment of rescue and fire fighting services to suppress or reduce potential secondary disasters to the minimum;
(b) Acquire oceanic and other data to improve the accuracy of predicting and warning of events such as tsunamis, typhoons and hurricanes;
The desirable features of the GDOS system would be the following:
(a) Ability to acquire a full view of the disaster-stricken area within 2.5 hours of the occurrence of the disaster;
(b) For wide area coverage, ability to observe the disaster-stricken area with a resolution of 5 m regardless of time of day and under any weather conditions;
(c) For narrow area coverage (i.e. within a ground observation radius of 40 kilometres), ability to observe the disaster-stricken area with a resolution of 2 m;
(d) Ability to observe the disaster stricken area at frequent intervals (i.e. every 2 hours) and for extended observation periods (i.e. two observation periods of 25 minutes for each time interval);
(e) Ability to promptly detect various types of disasters, such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions;
(f) Ability to detect vertical movements, variations and dislocations of ground areas to a resolution of a few centimetres;
(g) Ability to acquire information on ocean propagation of tsunamis (for example, water level, wavelength, geographical location, sea wave height and wind speed);
(h) Ability to obtain data on ocean water vapour, precipitation, sea surface temperature and wind speed for use in the prediction and tracking of typhoons.
F. Actions by the United Nations and other international organizations The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, held at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1994, noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters, primarily in the form of severe weather, volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes (A/CONF.167/9).
The Caribbean region is constantly exposed to hurricanes and earthquakes.
In recent years, there has been massive damage to Caribbean countries through natural hazards.
Impacts on the public infrastructure are severe, require large sums of money for critical reinvestment and severely impair the capacity of countries to cope with the crises in human and financial terms.
Most of the small island developing States, including the Caribbean islands, are in the tropical zone, where they are exposed to seasonal climatic conditions of a catastrophic nature such as cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms.
Satellites can track these weather formations continuously, and early warning can be given on television, radio and other special networks to populations in the path of the menace.
However, for sudden onset disasters, such as tsunamis, a short, simple message must be broadcast to a relatively large number of user terminals scattered throughout the area of impending disaster.
To address this problem, the Office for Outer Space Affairs proposed developing, in cooperation with interested specialized agencies of the United Nations, a project to implement a satellite-based disaster warning broadcasting system for remote, rural and outer communities of small island developing States.
This system would provide warning capability for sudden onset disasters using non-voice, one-way communications technology and could be integrated into the Command, Control, Coordination and Information (C3I) proposal described below.
As a result of recommendations made at the United Nations/European Space Agency Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development and Communications, an initiative that would result in the implementation of a satellite-based communications system for risk management in small island developing States of the Caribbean is being pursued by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and Nuova Telespazio of Italy.
The initiative involves adapting a satellite-based C3I system developed by Nuova Telespazio for risk management to meet the needs of Caribbean countries without duplicating existing infrastructures.
In its custom-tailored version, the system would enable civil protection agencies to manage preparedness, prevention, early warning, relief intervention and mitigation as well as post-crisis analysis for major natural and technological risks.
It could also contribute to an integrated coastal area management system to benefit small island developing States, as recommended by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in chapter 17 of Agenda 21Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3-14 June 1992 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.I.8 and corrigenda), vol.
An effective coastal management system should be able to provide access to innovative technologies such as remote sensing and geographic informations systems.
The command-and-control process for risk management is carried out through a computer and telematic infrastructure.
The C3I system allows for three hierarchical levels: (a) command and control national centres, (b) regional centres and (c) field systems for detection and action.
The data-gathering stations are the first level involved in acquiring and processing data.
They interface directly with sensors deployed in the field.
C3I sensors, appropriately distributed throughout the area of responsibility, are linked through a telecom-munications network to a command-and-control centre and to scientific centres, where the data are processed, stored and presented to the decision-making bodies in appropriate formats (e.g. as text, tables, maps or graphics).
After decisions are taken, the system makes it possible to transmit the orders to operative forces in the field.
Information from forces in the field and additional data from the sensors to the control centre make the new situation known, thus closing the command-and-control loop.
At present C3I is optimized for monitoring radioactive elements in the atmosphere, certain chemical components in the atmosphere, dynamics of seismic activity (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions), water level of rivers, lakes and basins and meteorological data.
However, by choosing different field sensors, the risk factors taken into consideration can be adapted to various operating environments.
The Department of Humanitarian Affairs is the specialized office of the Secretariat responsible for disaster-related matters.
One of its main functions is to mobilize, direct and coordinate external assistance provided by the United Nations system in response to disasters.
The Department also promotes pre-disaster planning as well as the study, prediction, prevention and control of natural disasters.
The secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction operates within the framework of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs.
The Decade was proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 42/169 of 11 December 1987, with a view to reducing, through concerted international actions, especially in developing countries, loss of life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters.
The activities in connection with the Decade were designed to achieve the above-mentioned objective by the following means:
(a) Improving the capacity of each country to mitigate the effects of natural disasters expeditiously and effectively, paying special attention to assisting developing countries in the assessment of potential damage caused by disasters and in the establishment of early-warning systems and disaster-resistant structures when and where needed;
(b) Devising appropriate guidelines and strategies for applying existing scientific and technical knowledge, taking into account the cultural and economic diversity among countries;
(c) Fostering scientific and engineering endeavours aimed at closing critical gaps in knowledge in order to reduce loss of life and property;
(d) Disseminating existing and new technical information related to measures for the assessment, prediction and mitigation of natural disasters;
(e) Developing measures for the assessment, prediction, prevention and mitigation of natural disasters through programmes of technical assistance, technology transfer, demonstration projects, and education and training, tailored to specific disasters and locations, and to evaluate the effectiveness of those programmes.
In defining specific targets to be achieved during the Decade, the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Decade called primarily for action at the national level, with supporting action at the regional and global levels.
Thus, by the year 2000 all countries, some through regional arrangements, should have in place the following:
(a) A national assessment of risk, including an overall identification of natural hazards that pose a disaster threat; for each type of hazard threat, an evaluation of the geographic distribution of the threat and estimates of its recurrence frequency and of its impacts; and an estimate of the vulnerability of the most important concentrations of population and resources;
(b) National and local prevention and preparedness plans, including the adoption of land-use and construction practices that resist or avoid hazards; the adoption of emergency-response plans that identify responsible organizations, hazard scenarios and essential actions; awareness programmes to educate people on the nature of the threat, including a training component; and concrete measures to mitigate damage and increase resilience in case of a disaster.
The challenge and the opportunity for the United Nations and other organizations is to provide the leadership and the commitment to create an agreed basis for coordinating and collectively benefiting from improved and comprehensive systems to meet those targets.
To meet this challenge, it will be necessary to draw upon the full range of organizational experience and resources in a methodical way.
Policies and procedures are needed to match the requirements with the capabilities of governments, specialized institutions and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and to develop frameworks for preparedness, early warning and response systems.
CDERA coordinates disaster relief in the Caribbean region.
For the purpose of improving disaster preparedness, it has made arrangements for regional cooperation for support to countries affected by disasters.
Since April 1994, small island countries and areas of the Caribbean region have experienced several major natural disasters, including tropical storm Debby (Saint Lucia, September 1994); tropical storm Gordon (Haiti and Cuba, November 1994); and hurricanes Luis and Marilyn (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Netherlands Antilles, September 1995).
There are three major applications of space technology for disaster management in the Caribbean.
Satellite imagery, along with other meteorological data, is used for weather forecasting.
The images provide early warnings on tropical cyclone activity and other severe weather conditions.
In the second application, weather forecasting offices have recently begun using satellite communications for two-way transmissions of meteorological data.
This application is part of the Regional Meteorological Telecommunication Network (RMTN), a cooperative effort of the United States National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States provides the Satellite Telecommunications and Analysis for Region IV (STAR-4) computer terminals used by the meteorological offices for access to the network.
The third major application is the use of GPS for volcano monitoring.
The Montserrat Volcano Observatory is using GPS technology to monitor deformation in the Soufrière Hills volcano, which began erupting in July 1995.
The measurements allow scientists to detect small changes in the dimensions of the volcano, providing clues about impending behaviour.
Many of the Caribbean small island developing States are undertaking disaster-reduction activities in a number of sectors.
Priority attention is being given to tourism, health, education, infrastructure and agriculture.
These activities are supported by the Caribbean Disaster Mitigation Project (CDMP), implemented by the Organization of American States, with funding by the United States Agency for International Development.
Emphasis is on regional disaster-mitigation activities and exchange programmes.
Insurance against disasters is an important issue in the Caribbean region.
Several initiatives are being taken to address the need for insurance to be made available.
CDMP attempts to improve cooperation between national disaster-management agencies and insurance companies.
A workshop on meteorological and hydrological data for the insurance industry was organized by WMO and ECLAC at Port-of-Spain in 1995; at the workshop, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provided advice on the basic considerations involved in insurance for weather-related agricultural losses.
The Disaster Preparedness Programme of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), begun in 1994, was consolidated in 1995 and has received increasing attention from international organizations and non-governmental organizations active in both emergency and development programmes.
The budget reserved for disaster preparedness activities in 1995 amounted to ECU 4.2 million.
In 1995, ECHO started 27 preparedness and prevention projects in Africa, Asia and Latin America and in the newly independent States and continued funding 6 projects that had been started in 1994.
The three key elements of the Disaster Preparedness Programme are the development of human resources, the strengthening of institutional capacities and the implementation of community-based, low-cost technology projects for preparedness and prevention.
The projects that were selected met several of the following criteria:
(a) Implementation in countries ranked unfavourably in the Human Development Index;
(b) Focus on the needs of the most vulnerable groups;
(c) Complementary in nature to national development programmes and relief operations;
(d) Sustainability over the long term, and environmental soundness;
(e) Community participation/management, strengthening of local capacities;
(f) Emphasis on the involvement of women.
By the end of 1995, operational projects had been evaluated, with most showing very positive results despite modest financial support and (often) small areas of impact.
Evaluators have praised the projects for their cost-efficiency, their rootedness in local resources and their potential for preventing or mitigating disaster.
European Commission activities in the field of disaster preparedness take full account of the recommendations of the Yokohama Plan of Action, agreed upon in the context of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.See "Report of the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction (Yokohama, 23-27 May 1994)" (A/CONF.172/9), chap. 1, annex II.
The challenge for the future will be to consolidate and develop the experience gained in 1995.
A challenge being addressed in 1996 and 1997 is to further develop specific elements of the Disaster Preparedness Programme, including the establishment of a preparedness technical advisory committee as an expert group to give advice on the Programme.
While the Internet has been rapidly spreading in developed countries for several years, until recently it was much less familiar to the disaster community in Central America.
Misconceptions about the complex technological aspects of transferring information persist, but these are being clarified as disaster managers begin to observe the practical uses and importance of the Internet.
It is more and more recognized by disaster managers in Central America as a tool that allows them to communicate quickly and inexpensively among themselves and thus improve the management of mass casualties and other disaster-related events.
The objective of a joint PAHO/NASA project is to contribute to the establishment of a global health network in the health and disaster sectors in Central American countries.
For this purpose, it has been necessary to convince national institutions in Central America, many of which were not familiar with the Internet, of the benefits of using this medium to improve coordination and share information in mass casualty events.
Such activities would prepare the groundwork for the use of telemedicine and other techniques in disaster management.
At the beginning of the PAHO/NASA project, only Costa Rica had direct access to the Internet.
Although the situation still varies from country to country, it has improved substantially.
The contacts developed by PAHO in health-related fields as well as in the disaster community (through its Emergency Preparedness Programme) have helped to bring about a synergy between the health sector and the emergency response community at the national level and throughout Central America.
The enthusiasm generated by health disaster professionals at the national level has resulted in the establishment of strong multidisciplinary working groups (telecommunications, computer experts, disaster management) in the various countries.
Central American countries have demonstrated their interest and support by assuming recurring costs such as those for telephone line installation and fees.
In the face of the reluctance of donors or executing agencies to assume recurrent costs, PAHO shifted from providing telephone lines for individual accounts to establishing nodes on a cost-sharing basis.
In Costa Rica, the Office of the President has established a governmental network known as GobNet.
The Office has provided funding for the project which has been distributed among managers of health disasters working at the Ministry of Health, the Institute of Social Security, the Regional Disaster Documentation Center, the Disaster Supply Management Project, the National Emergency Commission, the subregional office of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and the PAHO disaster focal point.
In Nicaragua, PAHO developed an Internet node that connects the entire health system and provides points of access for six national disaster managers.
PAHO specialists in Nicaragua have also developed audiovisual and printed information materials and have made other contributions to the effort of training users.
Training sessions on the use of Internet for disaster-related activities are ongoing in Guatemala, Honduras and Panama.
In other countries of the subregion, all health disaster coordinators in ministries of health have been, or will be, provided the necessary hardware to become integral members of the envisaged global health network.

INTRODUCTION
A. Background and objectives In its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, the General Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should promote the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology for developing countries.
In June 1995, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) at its thirty-eighth session endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1996 as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-second session.
Subsequently, in resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995, the General Assembly endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1996.
Page The present report contains a summary of the United Nations/International Astronautical Federation Workshop on "Education and Awareness: Space Technology and Applications in the Developing World".
The Workshop was organized as part of the 1996 activities of the Office for Outer Space Affairs under the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The Workshop was the sixth in a series organized by the United Nations, and was held at Beijing in conjunction with the forty-seventh Congress of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).
Previous symposia and workshops in this series were held in Austria, Canada, Israel, Norway and United States of America.
The main objective of the Workshop was to increase the awareness and the understanding of policy and decision makers and the general public in developing countries of the benefits of applications of space technology for national development.
The Workshop was also intended to increase the awareness and understanding of the public in developing countries of the benefits to be derived by appropriate applications of space technology.
Participants were provided with information on the possibilities offered by current space technologies, as a basis for discussing ways in which the participants could use those technologies in ongoing or planned programmes and projects.
The Workshop also considered how the mass media might be encouraged to promote applications of space technology.
Implementation of national and transnational space projects were introduced during the Workshop.
Presentations and discussions during the meeting addressed specific issues related to the overall theme of the Workshop, including: the value of space technology for sustainable development and environmental monitoring; educational aspects of space applications of space technology; and space systems in support of terrestrial infrastructures.
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.
B. Participants The United Nations invited developing countries to nominate candidates to participate in the Workshop.
Selected participants were required to have university degrees in remote sensing, communications, engineering, physics, biological or medical sciences or other fields related to the themes of the Workshop.
Participants should have been working in programmes, projects or enterprises in which space technology could be utilized.
Policy makers, at a decision-making level from both national and international entities, were also invited.
Funds allocated by the United Nations, IAF, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Government of China for the organization of the Workshop were used to cover the international air travel and per diem expenses of 31 participants from developing countries for the period of the Workshop and the IAF Congress.
For some of the selected participants from developing countries, registration for the Congress was also covered.
A total of 93 participants from the following Member States and international organizations attended the Workshop: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and United Republic of Tanzania; Office for Outer Space Affairs, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); ESA, the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT), IAF, the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), the International Space University (ISU) and the International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences (ITC).
The participation of experts from Austria, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States also contributed to the success of the Workshop. I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE WORKSHOP
A. General themes Well-established models of space applications were presented during the course of the Workshop with the aim of developing general guidelines on how developing countries can successfully use space technologies, including remote sensing and space communications systems, for environmental preservation and economic and social development.
A representative from each of the developing countries presented outlines of its national programme, followed by three panel discussions and an open exchange of views.
The participants interacted vigorously, providing information, comments, questions, recommendations and suggestions.
National and transnational space projects and programmes were discussed during the meeting, and future possibilities were suggested for increased scientific and technical cooperation between industrialized and developing countries, as well as among developing countries themselves.
B. Sustainable development Major food resources come from rural or remote areas, and the infrastructure needed to develop and manage both agriculture and fisheries normally has been tedious and expensive.
Recent developments using space technology have shown that expenditure on infrastructure can be significantly reduced and major efficiencies obtained.
Begun in 1992 and currently operational, the African Real Time Environmental Monitoring Information System (ARTEMIS) is a demonstration of what can be achieved.
The use of space technology yields information that can assist in monitoring cereal production and providing early warning of trends in food availability, particularly in drought-prone areas.
Furthermore, satellite data provide information on cold cloud duration and the state of vegetation.
Tropical forests are an important part of the Earth's ecosystem and a valuable resource for many developing countries.
These forests are in some of the most remote locations on Earth, and in most cases are inaccessible or difficult to survey using conventional techniques.
However, ongoing studies using data from a thematic mapper have shown that a forest register can be produced that contains a basin-by-basin inventory of forest estates categorized by forest types.
Such a forest register has the advantage of providing developing countries with an infrastructure for environmentally sustainable forest management plans.
In Sri Lanka, one of the main areas of concern is forest cover.
A recently updated forest cover map of Sri Lanka shows that the territory covered by forest has decreased dramatically in recent decades, indicating the need to initiate forest preservation and afforestation strategies.
The infrastructure needed to understand and manage the natural water resources of a country using conventional technologies is both expensive and complex.
The growing use of space-based technologies in observing and mapping river and stream systems now provides a mechanism that is both within the state of science and relatively inexpensive.
Studies and demonstration projects have already identified areas where savings could reduce costs by about two thirds.
Through both visible and infrared imagery, it is now possible to make reasonable estimates of the precipitation that has fallen in a particular river basin, and thus to estimate the run-off and change in the river flow.
Similarly, new satellite technology, particularly using microwaves, can now provide gross indications of soil moisture at the surface.
The ability to measure and monitor the availability of water is perhaps one of the most important contributions to the infrastructure needed to manage those natural resources that could eventually become seriously depleted in the near- and long-term future.
A systematic application of space technology in support of national development needs strong government support.
In China, an industrializing country, efforts are being made to enlarge the scope of space applications for sustainable development.
For example, the Harbin Institute of Technology provides training facilities to educate young scientists in using space technology in support of social and economic development.
The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) has been entrusted by the Government to operate remote sensing ground stations to acquire satellite data mainly from the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS), the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS), the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) and SPOT, thereby assisting in the management of natural resources.
Information based on such satellite data, such as forest inventory, mangrove inventory, paddy and crop assessment, drought and flood conditions and forest fire locations, is communicated to the responsible agencies for further processing and planning.
Several coordinating bodies have been set up in the recent past to cooperate with LAPAN, for example, the National Coordinating Agency for Disaster Management.
In Brazil, the national space programme is managed by the Brazilian Space Agency.
Its role is to coordinate the actions undertaken by various ministries in accordance with Brazilian space policy.
The main objective of that policy is to enhance the capability of space technology to accelerate national development and to monitor the environment.
Several ecosystems in Brazil need to be protected, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic forest.
The Brazilian space policy supports development and environmental preservation through satellite systems, providing the following services: data collecting and processing; remote sensing and imagery processing; and extending the national communications infrastructure.
The Indian space programme has been designed to accelerate national development and to improve the human condition.
Twenty-five State remote sensing applications centres are coordinating and conducting national programmes in support of natural resource management and sustainable development.
Remote sensing satellites and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are increasingly being used for mapping natural resources and hazard management.
Decision makers are frequently provided with socio-economic data and environmental studies performed at those centres, to serve as a basis for policy- and decision-making and planning.
As a successful example of space applications at the village level in India, cost-effective remote sensing techniques have been applied to identify land and water resources in order to map the basic integrated land and water resource units in the Anantapur district, located in the south-west of the State of Andhra Pradesh.
Detailed mapping of natural resources on a scale of 1:50,000 has been undertaken, using data from the Information Retrieval Service remote sensing satellite of India, known as IRS-1A.
The various scientific recommendations made on the basis of analyses of remote sensing data have been validated in the field by several rural exercises.
Those districts, frequently affected by droughts and floods and covering 45 per cent of the geographical area of India, were being extensively surveyed from outer space through the use of satellite remote sensing systems.
In the Philippines, ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are used to provide information on active lahar.
The main physical parameters that have to be considered are surface roughness, image texture and morphology.
While at this stage it seems difficult to accurately map lahar boundaries, radar imagery, including ERS-1 SAR data, will play a major role in monitoring changes because of its all-weather sensing capability.
The radar data will be particularly useful for monitoring the Mount Pinatubo area during the typhoon season through cloud cover, which adversely affects optical remote sensing sensors.
Radar imaging will be essential for providing accurate and timely information on lahar-affected areas to be used for disaster mitigation strategies such as early warning and evacuation plans.
Today, the vital role of meteorological services for sustainable development is well recognized.
The operational network of satellites within the World Weather Watch Department of WMO provides near continuous observations of the Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere.
The current network includes six satellites in geostationary orbit and three in polar orbit.
While this configuration provides considerable support to remote and rural areas, there are plans to increase the number of satellites and instruments available for use by developing countries.
C. Educational aspects of space applications
A movement in the United Kingdom to introduce space education into the educational programmes of young people has been, at least in the initial stages, teacher-driven rather than imposed by the Government.
A few motivated individuals have worked by example to win over their peers to an appreciation of the value of space data in enhancing the learning ability of pupils within the established curriculum.
The experience gained by providing remote support and training via personal conferencing can be harnessed to the advantage of developing countries.
Expert trainers and advisers can be readily accessed on a daily basis if necessary, both to train key personnel and to provide information within the countries concerned.
These newly trained individuals can then transmit knowledge or training to citizens within their own countries, while still having regular contact with their mentors wherever they might be geographically.
In the longer term, it should also be to the advantage of developing countries that young people in the developing world are better informed about their programmes and needs.
By providing data on a global basis, space applications promote understanding and make it easier for teachers and educators in developing countries to include space studies in their educational programmes, thus promoting a wider understanding of world issues among future generations.
Moreover, the value of space technologies for supporting and sustaining rural life must not be underestimated.
The challenge is to harness their potential so that rural populations can be maintained and strengthened, with the subsequent social and cultural benefits that accrue.
It is vital, therefore, that teachers and educators in both developed and developing countries should be encouraged to promote the usefulness of space technology so that maximum progress can be achieved according to the requirements of the end-user.
On the African continent, only a few countries are equipped with appropriate training and education facilities for space technologies.
The results of a recent survey of training facilities reveal that more staff is trained abroad than within Africa.
Furthermore, a close investigation shows that many space applications are just ad hoc projects without the prospect of being conducted on a sustainable basis.
African countries should provide for substantial investment in the education of specialists to apply space technology for national development, and especially for managing natural resources.
In the future, it may be possible that a mechanism for space cooperation could be established in Africa both to coordinate the sharing of experience and to promote space activities in the continent.
Recognition of the potential of satellite-based tele-education and telemedicine in rural and remote areas of the world is increasing.
Beginning with the Advanced Technology Satellite (ATS) experiments in the 1970s and the INTELSAT Project Share tests and demonstrations, it has become clear that this is one of the few approaches that has the scope to make a true planetary impact on problems of health care and education in rural areas.
In India, experiments were carried out with ATS-6 in the so-called SITE experiments.
This led to the definition, manufacture and launch of the Indian national satellites which could broadcast educational programming to low-cost terminals in rural India.
That programme has been implemented using community antenna television broadcasts, and now provides educational and health training courses to thousands of villages in remote areas of India.
In Indonesia, the Palapa satellite system was deployed to link the more than 18,000 islands of the country.
The primary goal of the system was to provide modern and reliable communications to a country whose geography represents a very special challenge.
An important second goal was to provide rural tele-education services to underserved areas.
A synergy was achieved by combining satellite services to commercial and industrial sites in rural areas where oil, timber or other resources were being exploited with services to rural educational and training sites.
In China, tele-education experiments were conducted under the INTELSAT Project Share.
Half the programming was produced by the Ministry of Education and half by Central China TV.
The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications implemented the space transmission systems.
Today, the China Satellite Educational Television Project uses over 90,000 terminals, all manufactured in China.
It reaches over three million students and is the largest satellite tele-education project in the world.
Impressive as the gains in tele-education and tele-health services have been, future progress will be even more so.
The powerful tool of the INTERNET, which now links some 30,000 computer networks and over 40 million users worldwide, will continue to grow and expand.
This network, which is supported by both satellite and fibre optic links, can support access to key educational and medical web sites, and allow instruction and medical consultation to be carried out by diverse methods such as e-mail or videoconferencing links.
Two design projects performed by students of ISU summer sessions held at Barcelona, Spain, in 1994 and at Vienna in 1996 - namely the Global Access to Tele-health and Education System and the Distant Operational Care Centre - should be able to give some key insights into the future of tele-education and tele-health services.
D. Improving infrastructures through space systems
The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has already established basic facilities at its various centres and units for the effective utilization of space capabilities, particularly remote sensing applications, by adopting a user-friendly approach.
ISRO has enlisted the user community in India, including individuals, private entities, national and regional organizations and institutions, to assist in its various programmes.
Space technology through the INTELSAT system has enabled many developing countries to establish, for the first time, high-quality independent communications links abroad.
For large countries and those with severe terrain and climate obstacles, it has also been possible to establish domestic communications at reasonable cost through the INTELSAT system.
A number of the countries concerned subsequently established their own domestic satellite systems.
Inmarsat is actively engaged in assisting users in China in solving their regional, educational and emergency communication needs.
Such assistance has involved fleet management operations, supervisory control and data acquisition networks using Inmarsat mobile data, as well as emergency and disaster relief operations for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
Within these emergency networks, there is a strong emphasis on ensuring a rapid response to emergency situations.
A major initiative for Inmarsat is to facilitate the economic development of rural and remote communications through the provision of effective communication facilities and services.
Several pilot projects are in progress, including: the provision of Inmarsat phones to selected rural communities to accelerate local economic development; the development of systems for the transfer of funds directly to remote communities; and a rudimentary system to promote the exchange of agricultural supplies.
Satellites have thus proved their value to developing countries in the context of international long- distance communications.
They have, more than any other technology, linked the countries of the world, and associated developing countries in that process.
Today, it is estimated that less than one tenth of that amount is available from traditional sources, including the contribution of developing countries themselves, bilateral aid, supplier credits, loans from the World Bank and regional development banks.
The private sector should be approached even more to provide funds towards improving the communications infrastructure in developing countries.
ITU is engaged in a variety of activities intended to stimulate the development of telecommunications in rural and remote areas.
These range from direct assistance in the implementation of projects to training, seminars and support for regulatory reform and for restructuring.
ITU is currently undertaking the SPACECOM Project in order to promote the widest application of space technology to the communication problems of developing countries.
It is pursuing that project by forging partnerships between industry, satellite operators and Governments of developing countries.
One of the elements of the SPACECOM Project is to encourage the use of space technology in applications such as telemedicine, tele-education and trade.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION As part of the national economy, the space industry should not be isolated.
The space industry and other high-technology industries depend greatly on the overall scientific and technological standard and industrial strength of a country.
In most cases, successful space programmes and projects require high initial investments.
It is therefore necessary to convince policy and decision makers, particularly in developing countries, of the value of providing resources to space programmes in appropriate areas, pointing out successful examples of space applications within the country concerned or in other developing countries.
The United Nations has played a major role in promoting space cooperation between developing and developed countries through several of its regional space application programmes.
Among others, the Regional Remote Sensing Programme, initiated in the 1980s for the Asian Pacific Region with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme, has been an outstanding example of the promotion of regional cooperation in applying space technology through pilot projects, training courses and seminars.
Following this success, a Regional Space Applications Programme (RESAP) has recently been established for the region of Asia and the Pacific, expanding space technology applications by including satellite communications, satellite meteorology and space science.
Existing cooperative entities in the region, such as RESAP, the Asian Association on Remote Sensing and the Expert Group on Remote Sensing of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, are powerful tools for initiating space projects jointly managed by developing and developed countries.
The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific is currently developing a standard to facilitate the wider use of sharing of resource databases in the region of Asia and the Pacific.
Participants reiterated that the exchange of data and information on a bilateral or regional basis is important for sharing experiences in preventing or mitigating transboundary and global problems such as environmental pollution and natural disasters.
The unique characteristics of space technology make it essential to have effective interaction between space experts and policy makers to ensure appropriate linkages with overall national programmes, as well as the continued support of the public at large.
Such an approach also makes possible the implementation of space-based development plans, which should be one of the primary objectives of any national space policy.
Workshop participants recommended that before projects are defined, the needs of the user community should be more clearly established.
Once the project is begun, ongoing evaluations should occur to ensure that these objectives remain on target.
Furthermore, at the conclusion of the project, the institutions created to implement the plans should be evaluated.
In India, efforts have been made to follow an applications-driven approach and establish a strong interface with national policy makers.
The strategy adopted by India was to demonstrate to the decision makers, with the total involvement of the user community, the efficiency of space systems designed to address development needs.
The operational mechanisms established to permit such a dialogue have been widely acclaimed as highly successful initiatives.
One of the fundamental differences between developing and developed countries is in education.
Developing countries would benefit from the use of space technology in this area, as science and education are usually the leading factors in development and national prosperity.
The most productive training is that targeted at local resource managers and policy and decision makers.
Space technology in support of Earth observation and communications infrastructure needs to be considered a tool or technique that anybody could use.
As such, training courses need to be highly practical, based on local examples and facilities, with the emphasis on simplicity rather than complexity.
However, in-depth education in the fundamental concepts of the technology should not be disregarded.
The most sustainable way to encourage the use of space technology is through educational curricula in local universities.
Evidence from many countries shows that universities are developing the important capability to provide a practical local introduction to Earth observation techniques.
There is a need to concentrate on training university teachers to make the best use of materials available to them, for as wide a variety of local applications of Earth observation techniques as possible.
This enhanced role for local universities appears to be promising - given its current successes in the areas of awareness-raising, training, education, research and even consultancy - and should be encouraged, since there is now a favourable policy environment for such initiatives.
It is particularly important that as many graduates as possible should be aware of the pace of environmental change and how to make use of straightforward Earth observation techniques for long-term improvement in environmental management.
If remote sensing is to have an impact at community levels, then it is also important that schools should start the process of raising environmental awareness through introducing straightforward Earth observation techniques to their pupils.
Awareness-raising is absolutely vital, but can be counterproductive if it is not done sensitively.
It is particularly important that senior decision makers in institutions should be aware of what can be done to meet their precise information needs in a cost-effective and timely manner, without the need for major monetary investments.
Awareness-raising is best undertaken by specialists such as agricultural or water resource managers rather than by remote sensing specialists.
Participants stated that demonstration models of space technology applications should be introduced to the public, including inexpensive and simple-to-use meteorological satellite stations, television receive-only terminals, very small aperture terminals and CD-based personal computers for display and manipulation of remote sensing satellite imagery.

A. Background and objectives 1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, decided, upon the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, inter alia, should promote greater cooperation in space science and technology between developed and developing countries as well as among developing countries.
2. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its thirty-eighth session, held in June 1995, endorsed the activities proposed for the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1996, as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-second session.
Subsequently, in its resolution 50/27 of 6 December 1995, the General Assembly endorsed the activities of the Programme for 1996.
3. In response to General Assembly resolution 50/27 and in accordance with the recommendations of UNISPACE 82, the Sixth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science: Ground-based and Space-borne Astronomy, was organized within the framework of the activities of the Programme for 1996, particularly for the benefit of developing countries and eastern European countries.
4. The Workshop was organized jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Space Agency (DARA), the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy at Bonn, and The Planetary Society (TPS).
5. The objective of the Workshop was to assess the achievements of the United Nations/ESA workshops on basic space science held from 1991 to 1996, by the following means: the review of activities of the Committee in the field of basic space science; status reports on the follow-up projects that emanated from the series of workshops; scientific presentations on cosmic-rays, photon, neutrino and gravitational-wave astronomy; scientific presentations on planetary exploration; working-group sessions to address immediate problems and projects; and selected presentations on important topics for developing countries and eastern European countries.
B. Organization and programme of the Workshop 6. The Workshop was held at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany, from 9 to 13 September 1996.
The Workshop continued a series of annual United Nations/ESA workshops on basic space science, which had been held in India in 1991 and in Sri Lanka in 1995 for the region of Asia and the Pacific (A/AC.105/489 and A/AC.105/640), in Costa Rica and Colombia in 1992 for the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (A/AC.105/530), in Nigeria in 1993 for Africa (A/AC.105/560/Add.1) and in Egypt in 1994 for western Asia (A/AC.105/580).
Page 7. The Workshop was attended by 120 astronomers and space scientists from the following 34 countries: Austria, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakstan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and Viet Nam.
The United Nations, DARA and ESA provided financial support to defray the cost of air travel and living expenses of 30 participants from developing countries and eastern European countries.
The expenses of other participants were defrayed by the following co-organizers of the Workshop: the Austrian Space Agency, the Centre national d'études spatiales (French National Centre for Space Studies), the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, the Institute for Space and Astronautical Sciences of Japan, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States and TPS.
Facilities, equipment and local transportation were provided by the German Space Agency.
8. The programme of the Workshop was developed jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, DARA, ESA, the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy and the University of Bonn.
9. Opening addresses were made by M. Fluegger, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany; J.-B. Mennicken, on behalf of DARA; H. J. Haubold, on behalf of the Office for Outer Space Affairs; A. Pedersen, on behalf of ESA; P. G. Mezger, Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy; L. Friedman, on behalf of TPS; and M. Huber, University of Bonn.
The participants reported on the information acquired and the work conducted at the Workshop to the appropriate authorities of their Governments, universities, observatories and research institutions.
The proceedings of the Workshop will be published in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy. I. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space
11. In view of the progress made by developing countries in all regions to promote awareness of the importance of education in basic space science, particularly by installing small telescope facilities and their use in educational and research activities, plans should be devised to enhance the participation of developing countries in more advanced research at an early stage.
A very effective means of achieving that goal would be for all space agencies actively to promote participation in future projects.
12. Coordination of such efforts by the major spacefaring nations would be a very important stimulus for the development process, and would enhance the capability of all countries to benefit through participation in space-related activities.
It is therefore recommended that the United Nations should explore such action in the context of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III).To be convened in 1999 or 2000 as a special session of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space open to all Member States of the United Nations (A/AC.105/637).
This could be done either in association with the proposed World Space Observatory (A/AC.105/640), or through projects to develop instrumentation independently or pursuant to plans for future space missions.
A mission related to basic space science as a joint effort between scientists in all countries of the world would provide an impressive illustration of the advantages and importance of international cooperation in such activities.
Which scientific activities would be suitable for such an effort should be evaluated in future workshops on basic space science.
13. The importance of cooperation can be seen directly in:
(a) The increase in hands-on experience acquired by non-spacefaring nations;
(b) The development of effective mechanisms for collaboration between those who are involved in space exploration and those who have not yet participated;
(c) The achievement of a high educational impact and the promotion of national awareness of the benefits and importance of participation in space activities, which would be built up through the operation of a World Space Observatory;
(d) The creation of employment in basic space science, which is an essential part of the development process.
14. The above-mentioned developments sprang from a recognition that the beginning of the third millennium presents a unique opportunity to highlight the global nature of basic space science and to stimulate international collaboration in this field.
UNISPACE III provides an occasion to define new worldwide action in basic space science to enhance the participation of States that are currently not involved in such activities.
15. The accelerated development needed to bridge the gap in technological development requires all States to use an original approach in generating activities associated with basic space science.
The implementation of such activities should be possible, given the necessary infrastructures for the development process.
16. The use of modern communication, administrative and industrial technologies should be considered an essential part of the overall effort.
Almost every activity and project discussed in the present report would be enhanced by the increased access of scientists worldwide to the Internet.
In the current phase, the global nature of basic space science can supply an important stimulus to the establishment of worldwide accessible facilities for basic space science, such as:
(a) The already available Global Navigation and Positioning System for geoplanetary studies requiring data acquisition on a worldwide scale to ensure progress in the understanding of geophysical phenomena;
(b) Centres for sharing data already collected by the major space agencies and open, in general, to the public.
Access to such collections of primary data continues to be a very powerful tool for participation in advanced research, for creating local support for basic space science, and for promoting the education process;
(c) A World Space Observatory for those windows that remain inaccessible from the ground;
(d) Early and direct participation in further exploration of the nature of the solar environment and the planetary system.
B. Centres for space science and technology education: regional cooperation in basic space science
18. The Workshop strongly recommended that existing regional cooperative structures (such as the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of American States) should be used to organize, stimulate and find support for regionally driven activities, such as the following:
(a) Encouraging the development of basic space science such as astronomy and geoplanetary research through mutual cooperation;
(b) Training and education in the use of modern techniques and instrumentation through the organization of courses and fellowships for the training of young scientists;
(c) Coordination in the development of the instrumentation needed for the efficient utilization of available regional facilities;
(d) Pursuit of research in basic space science and the necessary associated education;
(e) Dissemination of astronomical information on a regional basis;
(f) Regional exchanges of established scientists and educators.
C. Basic space science in Africa 19. The African participants in the Workshop, recognizing the leading role that basic space science can play in general intellectual, cultural and scientific development, as well as in the transfer of technology to Africa, and wishing to promote international cooperation and coordination between basic space scientists in Africa and elsewhere, formed a working group on basic space science in Africa.
The long-term objective of the working group is to make possible the creation of an African institute for space science.
To that end, the working group established the following strategic objectives to be immediately implemented in the region:
(a) Creating and maintaining a database of all African scientists involved or interested in basic space science in Africa;
(b) Promoting education in basic space science at all levels in African communities;
(c) Organizing regional conferences and training workshops;
(d) Identifying resource needs and coordinating efforts to address those needs;
(e) Promoting the participation of African space scientists in international endeavours;
(f) Promoting the active participation of African countries in space exploration by pursuing possibilities for collaboration in future space missions;
(g) Establishing a programme, beginning in October 1996, to develop well-trained faculty members in science and engineering by initiating a grant system to finance the required studies;
(h) Working toward the creation of science centres to disseminate information about basic space science in African countries.
20. The working group will meet annually to review progress and to formulate its objectives and strategy.
It will communicate with its members through a quarterly newsletter, which will be a forum for information exchange as well as a medium for dissemination of educational materials in basic space science.
D. International network of astronomical observatories
21. The participants in the Workshop recognized that:
(a) The study and discovery of Near-Earth Objects"Near-Earth Objects: the United Nations International Conference", Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, vol. 850, 1996.
(b) Newly created observation facilities, even though they may be of limited size, can be of great importance for such work;
(c) The need for efficient coordination of studies made at widely different locations on the surface of the Earth, and from space, will give a powerful impetus to both intellectual development and international communication;
(d) The need for studies can justify support for activities associated with the creation of new facilities in places where they do not yet exist, and can thus generate scientific developments that will continue to enhance the participation of developing countries in basic space science.
22. In view of the above, the Workshop recommended that the creation of an international network of observatories needed for such observations should be supported.
E. Continuation of the workshops on basic space science
23. The participants recognized the importance of the accomplishments of the five previous United Nations/ESA workshops on basic space science in the developing countries.
Those workshops were of particular importance for regular contacts at the scientific level between participating countries, as no other forum allows scientists from developing countries to interact in such an effective manner.
24. The participants also considered that the mutual exchange of experiences between those in the early phases of participation in basic space science represents an essential part of the accelerated development required, and that an interruption of the series of United Nations/European Space Agency workshops at this stage would create a setback for worldwide collaboration in basic space science.
25. The participants considered that establishing a process of communication between the nascent communities in basic space science and their Governments is an important part of participation in basic space science, and that the educational and purely scientific endeavours identified have been a strong stimulus for enhanced participation in space-related scientific activities.
27. Since offers to host future workshops have already been received, it was considered highly desirable to ensure that the rotation of workshops among the geographical regions should be maintained.
28. The participants stressed that the free flow of ideas, which is becoming ever more important in the modern communications society, is an essential part of successful participation in basic space science.
II. FOLLOW-UP PROJECTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS/EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY
WORKSHOPS ON BASIC SPACE SCIENCE HELD FROM 1991 TO 1996
A. Asia and the Pacific: astronomical telescope facility in Sri Lanka
was established in 1984 with the objective of introducing and accelerating the development of modern technologies in the fields of computers, communications, space science, robotics and energy.
The technical work commenced in 1987, and the Centre has been progressing rapidly since then.
The Centre has a technical staff capable of developing microprocessor-based electronics and communications equipment, and provided with well-equipped laboratories for research and development work in the above-mentioned fields.
The activities in space technology began in the late 1980s with only the satellite information receiving facility.
30. As a result of the First United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Science, held at Bangalore, India, in 1991 and organized by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, the United Nations recommended and supported the establishment of a telescope facility in Sri Lanka.
That Workshop and subsequent discussions held with the Government of Japan also led to a donation to Sri Lanka, under the Japanese Cultural Grant Aid Programme, of a 45-centimetre reflecting telescope.
In 1992, a representative of the Government of Japan visited Sri Lanka and held discussions with many institutions concerning the site for the installation.
Considering the heavy expenditure involved, it was decided to install the telescope at the Arthur C. Clarke Centre for the following reasons:
(a) A new four-story building was being constructed at the Centre, and the top floor could be modified to host the telescope facility;
(b) The Centre has the capability of handling the repair and maintenance of the fully automated, electronically equipped telescope facility.
31. The telescope facility at the Centre was inaugurated at the Fifth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science, held at Colombo from 11 to 14 January 1996 (A/AC.105/640).
32. Astronomical activities at the Centre are currently handled by its Space Applications Division, set up in 1994 with government approval.
The Space Applications Division operates and maintains the telescope facility at the Centre, and has introduced a few programmes to popularize astronomy in Sri Lanka.
33. The Space Applications Division has begun to maintain a database of amateur astronomy societies and astronomical societies in order to meet the needs of Sri Lankan schools for observation facilities.
To promote education in astronomy, the Centre will be launching a weekend programme for science teachers in consultation with the Department of Education.
The programme will be free of charge, the cost of the training being borne by the Centre.
Live radio broadcasts of the programme to the rural community have been arranged, as the radio is still the most popular medium of communication in rural Sri Lanka.
34. Since January 1996, the Centre has been organizing observation programmes for science societies and scientific professional institutions in order to promote astronomy among professionals in Sri Lanka.
35. With assistance from international organizations such as the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the Centre is planning to conduct an undergraduate course in collaboration with universities in Sri Lanka.
IAU has already agreed to support the Centre financially and to send a resource person to work on the proposed programme.
36. The Centre intends to launch an international programme in corporation with observatories in other countries, and also wishes to be engaged in NASA programmes as soon as the staff of the Centre obtain the necessary training through programmes already arranged.
37. The training programmes for scientists at the Centre have been finalized with the support of the Japan International Corporation Agency through the Bisei Observatory in Japan.
Another training programme is being negotiated through the Overseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom for post-graduate studies in astronomy at a university in the United Kingdom.
The Centre has carried out a site survey for a future project to set up a national observatory in Sri Lanka once astronomy becomes popular in the country.
B. South America: Galactic Emission Maps project in Colombia
38. At the Second United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science, held at San José, Costa Rica, and at Bogotá, Colombia, in 1992, it was stated that the Andean equatorial region offered a combination of geographical attributes, unavailable in other regions of the world, that had great scientific potential for a certain class of observations.
Its equatorial latitude and the presence of high peaks (above 4,000 metres) opened up many scientific opportunities.
Those characteristics make the region advantageous for observations of the galactic disk (in the radio part of the spectrum) and for observations requiring simultaneous access to both celestial hemispheres.
Other classes of experiment, such as automated supernova searches, complement existing efforts at sites in the northern and southern hemispheres.
39. The need for an accurate determination of the diffuse radio and microwave emission from the galactic disk was highlighted by the limitations imposed on cosmic microwave background (CMB) data because of galactic foreground emission.
The Galactic Emission Maps project involves international collaboration (Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Spain and United States) aimed at obtaining an absolute-calibrated multifrequency sky survey in the range 408 to 5,000 megahertz.
A 5.5-metre parabolic reflector equipped with total power radiometers at 408, 1,465 and 2,300 megahertz and with a differential radiometer at 5,000 megahertz has been built and is being operated at selected sites to achieve maximum sky coverage.
The first map at 408 megahertz taken from the equatorial site in Colombia has been presented, and the ways in which galactic contamination affect CMB data and correction methods are to be discussed.
40. The scientific opportunities offered by, and the feasibility of establishing, an astronomical observatory in ColombiaScience and Technology for Central America: Plans and Strategies (San Salvador, University of El Salvador, 1995). have been explored.
41. In the early part of the 1990s, Honduras took the initiative to establish the first astronomical observatory in Central America.
On the basis of a strategy of regional cooperation between Central American national universities and of contacts between astronomers and prestigious astronomical research centres at the international level, the first steps towards the establishment of the observatory were taken at the Second United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science.
Since 1994, an astronomical observatory has been functioning at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras"An astronomical observatory for Central America: a realistic way of strengthening basic space science in developing countries", American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings, vol. 320, 1994, pp. 13-22. (the National Autonomous University of Honduras) at Tegucigalpa.
This academic institution has been equipped with a 42-centimetre computerized telescope and other facilities, and is ready to begin a programme for training researchers and technicians from Central America.
Several important cooperation agreements are being implemented to promote the development of basic space science in the region.
42. In conjunction with the Fourth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Basic Space Science, held at Cairo in 1994, it was decided to refurbish the telescope at the Kottamia Observatory in Egypt.
The National Research Institute for Astrophysics and Geophysics (NRIAG) at Helwan and the Ministry of Scientific Research of Egypt entered into a contract financed by the Government of Egypt.
The project included the design and manufacture of a new optical system for the 1.88-metre telescope tube.
The mirror materials were made from schott zerodur to ensure superb optical quality in the temperature range for observations.
In order to achieve a high-quality optical surface in all applicable positions of the telescope, a new support, or mirror cell, for the primary mirror will be necessary.
A new 18-point support instead of the old nine-point support has been proposed, and will become part of the project.
The new optics will be integrated into the nearly 30-year-old Kottamia telescope, and first light is expected in early 1997.
In July 1995, the representatives of NRIAG accepted the results of tests of the blanc for the primary mirror at a factory in Germany.
The mirror was still being ground and polished, resting on an 18-point support just as in the future telescope cell.
The procedure was to take several months, first creating a surface of high quality and then gradually approximating the required spherical shape.
Preliminary tests of the mirror shape showed excellent results, and the preliminary acceptance tests were to be carried out on schedule in 1996.
mission scheduled for 2001
was discussed. One suggestion was that Egypt participate in the Mission through the design, building and testing of a drill for obtaining subsurface samples.
44. TPS, a sponsor of the series of United Nations/European Space Agency workshops, is following up that suggestion.
TPS representatives, together with Egyptian scientists, have begun organizing a study of the concept.
They informed the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences about the idea, and the Institute, in turn, formally invited the Ministry of Scientific Research of Egypt to study the concept for potential use on the Russian Mars 2001 Mission.
Such a study has already begun.
45. Inclusion of a sort of drilling mechanism in the payload of such a mission would assist scientists in the investigation of volatile organic materials and mineralogy.
Twenty years ago, the Viking Mars lander was able to obtain samples from depths of up to 10 centimetres.
Today, a drill with the capability of boring more than 1 metre would be essential to further research and investigation.
46. Egypt has expertise in drill development.
A few years ago, as part of the archaeological exploration of the Pyramids, a sophisticated drilling system was developed to drill into a subsurface chamber and deploy a camera without allowing air into the chamber.
The drill perforated the limestone to a depth of two metres without the use of lubricants or cooling fluids that might have contaminated the environment of the pit, and successfully collected six samples.
47. The above-mentioned experiment and other more common terrestrial applications suggest that the necessary technology base for drill development can be brought together in the Russian Mars 2001 Mission.
48. A study team of Egyptian scientists, collaborating with Russian Federation, United States and European scientists, has been established. III. SELECTED PROJECTS
A. Oriental Robotic Telescope network 49. The objective of the Oriental Robotic Telescope (ORT) network is non-stop observations on variable stars with other networks of automated photometric telescopes.
Complementary to the ORT network in longitude and latitude intervals are projects such as the Global Network of Astronomical Telescopes in the United States, the Chilean cordillera stations and the South African stations.
Photometric telescopes will be dealt with initially and then extended to spectroscopy.
50. The data collected by each station will be automatically and simultaneously transmitted via the Internet or telecommunication satellites to all the scientific centres of the network, making common rapid data reductions possible.
51. From 12-year archives of meteorological satellites, it appeared that sites located at a latitude of between 15o and 35o north and a longitude of between 10o west and 110o east have high-quality astronomical conditions with a significant annual number of clear nights.
Such sites involve countries from Morocco to the western deserts of China.
In addition to their astronomical history, those countries are suitable because they have high mountains in semi-desert areas, resulting in a clear sky with low telluric absorption.
The site selection will be completed by local astronomical tests, such as scintillation and seeing measurements.
52. The prediction of sky quality, together with local access facilities, ought to give a list of network stations not subject to the same air streams.
The minimum number of network stations necessary to follow the variable stars each night without interruption is 10.
53. Many of the countries in question have had great astronomers in the past, but nowadays few of them carry out research in astrophysics or teach it.
The Institut des sciences de l'univers/Centre national de la recherche scientifique, the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) and the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées (OMP) have therefore proposed to collaborate in developing education in astronomy and astrophysics and in training students in the universities of those countries using the facilities of an astrophysical laboratory equipped with a telescope of 60 centimetres in diameter.
The training of engineers and technicians in French observatories such as OHP and OMP has also been proposed.
54. The aim of such efforts is to accelerate the astrophysical development of the countries concerned with a view to ensuring their rapid scientific and technical participation in the ORT network.
The reduction and interpretation of the scientific data would be jointly undertaken, and the scientific results would be shared.
55. Since the majority of astronomical objects are variable, and since several characteristic time scales of variations are often detected in the same object (in years, days, hours or less), the analysis of variabilities increases the knowledge of the physical processes operating in those objects.
56. The main scientific programmes concern:
(a) Stellar variability (i.e. asteroseismology) on, inter alia, T Tauri, Be and B, W CMa, δ Scuti, Ap- and Am-type stars, red giant and dwarf stars, planetary nebulae and post-novae;
(b) Planetology, involving the search for planets around stars and stellar occultations in the solar system, the analysis of planets and their satellites and other research.
57. Because of the rotation of the Earth, collaboration between networks of robotic telescopes devoted to such programmes may assist in resolving some important contemporary astrophysical problems in:
(a) Photometry: this technique measures the stellar flux variation at some wavelengths, and enhances knowledge of the evolution and internal structure of the stars;
(b) Spectroscopy: this technique, in its low-resolution modes, establishes the abundance of the chemical elements, and, in its high-resolution modes, is able to establish the physical parameters of stars and their dynamic behaviour;
(c) Interferometry: this technique, on radio, infrared or visible frequencies, establishes the diameter variations or the shape of stars, and even provides a detailed description of their external layers, with ejections of matter, among other measurements.
The stellar neighbourhood can also be examined and planets discovered.
58. Since photometry is the simplest of the observational techniques, it is proposed to begin by following stellar variability in the UBVRI spectral ranges.
The observations will be made with large-field Ritchey-Chrétien telescopes equipped with charge-coupled-device cameras.
59. During the First International Conference on Space and Astronomy, held at Amman in September 1994, an international committee to promote the ORT network was created, including members representing Egypt, France, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco and Yemen.
Discussions are under way with Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Malaysia, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia.
60. Contacts must still be developed with China, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and other States that are interested in participating.
61. An international group of 100 physicists and engineers based at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, west of Chicago, Illinois, has begun to design the detector for the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory"Cosmic ray mysteries", Physics World, vol. 9, 1996, pp. 47-52. to study the highest-energy cosmic rays observed on Earth.
Named after the French physicist who in 1938 first detected the air showers produced by high-energy cosmic rays, the Pierre Auger project will seek to identify the unknown source of the highest-energy cosmic rays that reach the atmosphere.
62. The design group receives support from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Fermilab, the Grainger Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Universities Research Association, Inc. and the University of Chicago.
63. The Pierre Auger project began a six-month workshop on 30 January 1995.
During the workshop, a core group of about 10 scientists worked at Fermilab.
The rest of the participants came to Fermilab for meetings, but worked mainly at their home institutions, communicating electronically in a "workshop without walls".
On 30 July 1995, at the end of the workshop, the design was published in a book-length description of the cosmic ray detector of the project.
The report explained the scientific motivation for the project, and presented a technical design, a site survey report and a cost estimate.
64. The design report serves as a basis for proposals for funding from participating States.
Thus far, the Pierre Auger project involves participants from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russian Federation, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States and Viet Nam.
65. With funding secured, the Pierre Auger project will build and operate the detectors, two 2,500-square-kilometre arrays, one in the southern hemisphere (Argentina) and one in the northern (United States).
The group hopes to be ready to observe the first high-energy cosmic-ray air showers of the new millennium.
66. The data management will be divided into three broad areas, involving the monitoring of data, real data and discrete data.
High-quality data will be saved in the mass storage system.
If enough funding becomes available, the project is expected to be completed by the turn of the century.
C. Education and research using small astronomical telescopes 67. Small telescopes (generally from 0.4 to 1 metre in diameter, but sometimes smaller or larger) are found in research observatories; in universities, where they are used for research and teaching at all levels; occasionally in schools; in public observatories or attached to planetariums and science centres; and often in the hands of individual amateur astronomers or clubs.
Depending on its location, the telescope may be used for research by professional or amateur astronomers, or for the training of astronomers.
In each case, the telescope may also be used to instruct and inspire students and the general public, thus contributing to the support and advancement of astronomy.
68. At the Fifth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop, it was decided that an education and research curriculum for the use of small telescopes, especially in developing countries, should be developed.
A paper prepared by India, entitled "Small telescopes in research and education", was distributed to all participants at the Sixth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop.
It concluded that: "(i) When a new astronomical facility is set up, it should be at a level consistent with the workshop facilities and infrastructure support available.
The equipment should not overwhelm the user; (ii) For the initial training of manpower, cooperation should preferably be sought from countries which are culturally akin to the host country; (iii) Attempts should be made to integrate astronomical facilities with the teaching programme; (iv) For best results, observational programmes should be chosen so as to form a part of international campaigns."
The paper provided a focus for discussion at an informal two-hour plenary session at the Sixth Workshop.
69. The conclusions presented in the paper submitted by India were warmly received by the participants.
A few other significant observations and recommendations were made during the discussion, including the following:
(a) Because of the varied uses of small telescopes, the needs of students, teachers, amateur astronomers and the general public should be taken into account in drawing up the relevant curricula;
(b) Future United Nations/European Space Agency workshops should include more time for discussion and practical activities;
(c) The telescope should be simple, well-instrumented and appropriate to the local infrastructure and expertise;
(d) Internet connections are important for many aspects of the use of small telescopes, for example, in resorting to e-mail for international communication and collaboration, and in accessing remote telescopes and databases.
70. It was also recommended that:
(a) The current initiative should be pursued by a working group consisting of both small telescope experts and users;
(b) The working group should compile a practical guidebook to the use of small telescopes, on the basis of both existing and new material.
The guidebook could be edited and distributed by the United Nations;
(c) A future United Nations/European Space Agency workshop should be held at an astronomical observatory with a small telescope, placing strong emphasis in the agenda on the practical aspects of teaching and research with such a telescope;
(d) Users of such telescopes should have a strong input to the above-mentioned agenda;
(e) Assistance should be sought from knowledgeable outside organizations (such as IAU) and individuals.
71. Participants emphasized that, especially in developing countries, the enhancement of science education and literacy (both in schools and among the general public) could facilitate further progress in basic space science and astronomy.
Conversely, basic space science and astronomy could promote public awareness, understanding and appreciation of science, and attract young people to the study of science and technology. D. Developing astronomy and space science worldwide
72. The United Nations/European Space Agency workshops on basic space science represent one part of the efforts now being made by several international agencies and through bilateral cooperation between specific institutions in developing and developed countries to assist astronomers in developing countries.
It is particularly valuable that the workshops have been held in each of the major economic regions of the world, since this will stimulate intra-regional cooperation.
During the Sixth United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop, for example, participants saw important steps towards such regional cooperation being taken by astronomers from several African countries, and some tentative ones taken by participants from the region of Asia and the Pacific.
Astronomers from Central America have provided a very good example of how small, neighbouring countries can work together usefully.
Their cooperation was undoubtedly stimulated partly by the Second United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop.
Sometimes, within a region, a developed and a developing country may be neighbours, and a useful cooperative relationship can be established with a minimum of formalities.
A good example of this is the close working relationship between astronomers in Morocco and those at the University of Nice, in France.
In other regions, although all the countries may be developing ones, some are clearly more advanced in certain respects than others.
In astronomical matters, China and India are at a quite different level from most other developing countries in Asia.
Regional cooperation between the astronomers of Asia has a high potential for the development of astronomy in some of the smaller countries.
73. In addition to organizations such as European Space Agency and TPS, which have cooperated directly with the United Nations in the organization of the basic space science workshops, other organizations have concerned themselves with assisting astronomers in developing countries.
UNESCO is currently encouraging regional cooperation among the southern States members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
About 10 years ago, IAU formed a Working Group for the Worldwide Development of Astronomy, reflecting its growing concern for astronomers in developing countries since the end of the Second World War.
The IAU Working Group has been particularly interested in astronomy in Central America, north Africa and Viet Nam.
Although IAU can provide only limited financial resources, it can extend assistance through its international schools for young astronomers and the newly instituted Teaching for Astronomy Development programme.
By such means, astronomers can be brought into the countries concerned in order to assist in the establishment of teaching and research capabilities.
74. Perhaps the most important effort that the United Nations, IAU and other organizations make is to provide isolated astronomers with the personal contacts that they need.
Modern means of communication, such as e-mail, have desensitized many individuals in developed countries to the problems that astronomers in developing countries face.
To the typical astronomer in a developed country, e-mail and the associated possibilities of electronic publication are the cheap panacea to all problems of communication.
It is exceedingly difficult to convince such an individual that for an astronomer in a developing country, e-mail, if available at all, is often intermittent and unreliable.
Electronic journals, even if they should turn out to be cheaper to subscribe to, are beyond what many astronomers can hope to use in the foreseeable future.
Some individuals have e-mail, but not in a location that they can visit every day.
E-mail messages are sometimes received from astronomers who give a return electronic address which never appears to be operating.
Organizations like the United Nations and IAU can at least bring these problems to light; perhaps they could even bring some influence to bear on their solution; but the most important help will come from individuals and specific institutions.

1. The Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa was organized within the framework of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The theme selected for the Conference was "The role of space technology in addressing local needs".
The objective of the Conference was to examine the reasons for the lack of exploitation of cost-effective space technology opportunities in Africa and the key role that decision makers could play in improving the current situation.
The Conference was aimed at decision makers and science and technology advisers of Governments, including directors, programme managers, senior research and application scientists and senior university educators.
Chief executive officers and senior technical managers of private institutions and industrial establishments were also invited to the Conference.
The Conference was co-sponsored by the Government of South Africa, the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT), the European Space Agency (ESA), the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States of America and Nuova Telespazio of Italy. Page
2. The present report describes the organization of the Conference, the programme of the Conference and the proposed follow-up action.
It has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. B. Organization of the Conference
3. The initial announcement of and call for participation in the Conference were distributed via note verbale in April 1996 to the missions of all African States to the United Nations.
A second note verbale was sent in June 1996. Copies of the notes verbales were sent to all resident representatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Africa.
In July 1996, the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat requested the assistance of UNDP resident representatives in ensuring that high-ranking government officials were nominated to participate in the Conference.
4. The Government of South Africa defrayed the costs of boarding and lodging 30 participants from other African countries, as well as all other local costs associated with the organization of the Conference.
Funds for the international travel and subsistence allowance of 30 participants were provided from the fellowship budget of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications and the financial support provided by the co-sponsors.
5. A total of 99 persons attended the Conference; 43 of the participants were from South Africa.
The African participants were nationals of the following 21 countries: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Representatives of the following organizations were also in attendance: the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), EOSAT, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), ESA, the International Development Research Centre, Inmarsat, Matra Marconi, NASA, Nuova Telespazio and the Regional African Satellite Communications Organization (RASCOM).
C. Programme summary 6. The programme of the Conference (see annex) was developed by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, taking into account several factors, including the discussions and eventual outcome of the first United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa, held at Dakar from 25 to 29 October 1993 and other technological and political developments relevant to Africa.
The Conference consisted of several plenary and concurrent technical sessions, during which formal presentations were given on various topics related to the use and development of space technology.
Approximately one day was reserved for working group discussions, during which the recommendations of the Conference were discussed.
One day was devoted to a technical visit to the satellite tracking and receiving station at Mikomtek.
7. The plenary sessions focused on topics of interest to all participants and served as starting points of discussion at the subsequent working group sessions.
The topics dealt with included: (a) the potential contribution of space technology in meeting local needs; (b) trends in space technology applied to health, education, communications, natural resources and the environment; (c) communications policies and regulations and their impact on the social and economic development of Africa; (d) the potential impact of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth on Africa's development; (e) the commercialization of space activities; (f) how Africa could benefit from the experience of India; and (g) cooperation among African countries in relevant areas of space science and technology.
8. The concurrent technical sessions concentrated on the following thematic areas: (a) Communications for development; (b) environment and food security; (c) research and applications in space technology; (d) land-use management; (e) Earth observation data gathering, analysis and applications; and (f) health care and education.
Those sessions served to highlight the potential application of space technology in meeting local development needs.
A special Youth Programme on Space, lasting approximately half a day and hosted by a former NASA astronaut, Dr. Mae Jemison, was attended by 70 South African secondary school students.
9. During the Conference it was noted that the goal of national development in many African countries was pursued principally by undertaking activities that (a) promoted improvements in agriculture, forestry and their related industries, mineral and water resources and human resources and (b) served to mitigate the effects of natural disasters (severe drought, flooding etc.).
In addition, there was an increased awareness of the environmental impact of various development activities.
It was generally acknowledged that all those development activities required adequate access to and the exchange of information for informed decision-making.
Papers presented at the Conference demonstrated the potential of space technology to contribute in a cost-effective manner to the provision of information and, ultimately, to the socio-economic development of African countries, as had been done in other developing regions of the world.
Among other issues, the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone, distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated.
In addition, the value of data from a variety of Earth observation and meteorological satellites in a wide range of activities such as famine early warning, food security, rainfall estimation, environmental monitoring, geological exploration and land-use/land-cover mapping was discussed.
10. Working group discussions focused on the reasons for the underutilization of space technology in Africa, on the disparity between African countries and those in other regions and on the identification of specific and realistic measures, achievable in both the short and the long term, which would eventually improve the current situation.
The outcome of those deliberations was the Pretoria Memorandum on Space Technology in Africa.
The Memorandum, which was formally adopted by the Conference on 8 November 1996, read as follows:
PRETORIA MEMORANDUM ON SPACE TECHNOLOGY IN AFRICA
Introduction The participants of the Second United Nations Regional Conference on Space Technology for Sustainable Development in Africa noted that, as it has been proven in other parts of the world, space technology has tremendous potential for contributing to the economic and social development of countries in Africa, particularly through the improved management of the environment, improved communications, enhanced food security, delivery of services in health care and education, and the mitigation of natural disasters, just to name a few.
In spite of their proven benefits, however, applications of space technology such as satellite remote sensing, geo-positioning systems (GPS), satellite meteorology, atmospheric and ocean sciences, basic space sciences and satellite communications are far from being effectively utilized by most African countries to address national development issues.
I. AFRICA AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
Africa is a land of striking contrasts and great natural wonders; a giant plateau between the Atlantic and Indian oceans, where humanoids evolved.
It is the second largest continent on Earth, embracing one fifth of its land area and supporting one eighth of the world's population and having a major impact on global change processes.
It is blessed with abundant natural and human resources and great potential for development.
II. RELATED ISSUES
At a variety of international and regional conferences, such as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992, the Regional Symposium on Telematics for Development, held at Addis Ababa in April 1995, the fifth Third World Academy of Sciences General Conference on Science and Technology for Development, held at Abuja, Nigeria, in September 1995, and the twenty-first and twenty-second meetings of the Conference of Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), held in 1995 and 1996, it has become apparent that, as we approach the twenty-first century, most of Africa remains the last global frontier to be positively impacted by the wave of science and technology developments that are bolstering social and economic growths in other lands, due to a wide range of factors, including the following:
● Inadequate awareness by key decision makers of the value of space technology and its impact on social and economic development;
● Inadequate awareness of technology already in use, either nationally or regionally;
● Poor availability of technical support within many countries;
● Insufficient coordination of telematic services and other space technologies;
● Inadequate telecommunication infrastructure;
● Inadequate funding of relevant national institutions;
● Preoccupation with transfer of technology from other lands for applications at home;
● Little inclination towards indigenous research and technology development programmes;
● Poorly defined science and technology policies that can take advantage of the unfolding developments in space science and technology;
● Disabling regulatory policies.
III. THE NEEDS OF AFRICA
The basic needs of Africa and its peoples include not only housing, clothing, health, food, education and many others, but also the need to address participatory democracy, human rights, gender issues, environmental protection, cultural heritage and accessibility of Africans to total and global information.
Adequate information is a major prerequisite to gaining knowledge in any field of human endeavour.
In Africa, adequate information is urgently needed to help cure illness, bring food, bolster production, foster education about the latest technological development, research trends and results, applications products, services and equipment and formulate social and economic policies.
In order to respond to these human needs as well as to translate related human endeavours into economic productivity in Africa, science and technology have become an indispensable tool.
It should be emphasized that, today, one of the greatest challenges for Africa and its peoples is the provision of an enabling environment that will support the nurturing and development of science and technology in each African country.
IV. PRIORITY NEEDS WHICH CAN BE ADDRESSED USING SPACE TECHNOLOGY
Several development needs in Africa that could be addressed using space technology are: communication and information technology, disaster prediction and management, education, energy development, environmental management, food security, health care, rural development, transportation and urban management.
V. AFRICA'S EXPERIENCE WITH SPACE TECHNOLOGY
With a few exceptions, Africa has not shared in the telecommunication boom being experienced in other developing regions of the world.
Over the past decade, the annual growth rate in main telephone lines has remained static at 8 per cent per year while it has increased to about 25 per cent in Asia.
As an example, Africa has 12 million telephone lines that have been installed since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. By comparison, in 1995 alone, China installed 20 million telephone lines and it plans to continue at this rate in order that, by the year 2000, 100 million lines will have been installed in China.
This is reflected in the observed fast economic growth in Asia compared with that in Africa and its greater participation in the new global economy.
A few African countries are connected to the global Internet system using available space technologies.
However, because of the poor state of communication in most of Africa, many of Africa's educational and research institutions only have limited, indirect and unreliable access to Internet and its associated World Wide Web.
In a very limited number of African countries, significant strides are being made in the areas of space science and technology development, particularly in telecommunication and space services such as satellite tracking, telemetry and control, Earth observation and the utilization and commercialization of the data thereof, microelectronics and its applications in commercial markets and tele-education.
In the area of space-related education, the exposure of most African countries to utilize existing technology to date is limited to training. However, their participation in the evolution of the technology itself is for the most part insignificant.
In the area of health care, a number of African countries are carrying out studies to understand vector-borne diseases, such as schistosomiasis (river blindness), water-borne disease and malaria prediction.
A number of medical institutions are also using space capabilities available worldwide to seek health-related services such as diagnosis, prescription, training and advice from their counterparts abroad.
Examples are Internet and HealthNet.
VI. THE WAY FORWARD: THE NEXT STEPS
In acknowledgement of the prevailing conditions and with a determination to rectify it, the Conference recognized that a core of expertise exists at home and abroad, around which substantial development of indigenous African capacity can and should be built.
This is urgently required if Africa is to have any relevance in the emerging technologies of the fast-approaching twenty-first century.
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies, financial and other resources and an enabling environment.
For Africa to develop a competitive competence in the global arena requires enlightened and exemplary leadership committed to science and technology.
Such a leadership should support the creation, throughout the continent and at the national level, of a space science and technology consciousness not only in the application potential of the technology but also in the understanding of the technology itself; that is, how and why the technology works the way it does.
Africa's Governments should support indigenous science and technology initiatives, such as Afrispace, the Regional African Satellite Communications Organization (RASCOM) and Telecom Africa and the initiatives of the United Nations on (a) the centres for space science and technology education and (b) the cooperative information network linking scientists, educators, professionals and decision makers in Africa (COPINE), and should marshal all necessary resources to translate such initiatives into viable and enviable programmes.
A significant aspect of the leadership effort is improvement of collaboration at the national, subregional and continental levels in the following areas:
● Joint technology development;
● Capacity development with a focus on the utilization of African institutions;
● Sharing of knowledge across professional and sectoral boundaries;
● Increase in the role of the Africa private sector;
● Focus on broader science and technology programmes.
In order to promote cooperation among African countries, a greater understanding of the following cooperation issues is necessary:
● Are we effectively using cooperative opportunities to build African capacity?
● Are we making the best use of our resources in cooperative ventures through focused and coordinated activities?
● Are we using African resources effectively to jointly develop world-class technologies?
● Are we using space technologies effectively to enhance collaboration?
There are many compelling advantages to improving the level of collaboration among African nations.
● An ability to pool resources and reduce costs for technology development (e.g. the undertaking of joint projects);
● The acquisition of technology solutions which are relevant to Africa;
● The ability to share lessons and experience;
● An improved ability to negotiate international agreements (e.g. trade and technology agreements).
The Conference further recognized that:
● There is now a very urgent need for national leadership in Africa to adopt space technology as a tool for meeting national development needs, particularly in the following areas: resource management and the environment, information and communications, food, health and capacity-building;
● National leadership should promote the use of space technology to enhance communication and understanding among the leaders of Africa, which is a key element to promoting peace and co-development on the continent.
In consideration of the above, the Conference recommended that:
● The United Nations should take steps to organize a joint leadership conference with a focused agenda to acquaint decision makers with space technology pertinent to development issues in their countries;
● A national and regional strategic framework in which specific actions may be carried out in each nation should be established by ensuring that an entity exists, preferably in the office of the highest governmental authority in each country, to coordinate space-related activities;
● Each national entity should not only inventory the state of technology and policy development in its country, but also follow trends in the use of technologies elsewhere in the region and in the world.
In addition, the entities should conduct necessary research on space-related opportunities and relevant spin-off products of potential value to their countries.
The entities should ensure that policies exist that would ensure that space technology is included in the educational process, particularly in national academic programmes.
The strategic national framework should specifically:
● Identify short- and long-term goals and strategies for meeting national needs within the areas identified above;
● Include users, academy, industry and state;
● Develop, adopt and implement a regulatory framework for the effective use of space communications and information policies;
● Identify and strengthen elements of endogenous and indigenous capability building areas, such as human resource development with the participation of private industry;
● Identify and empower centres of excellence that would be responsible for the implementation of these national space policies.
In the immediate future, they should build databases that would facilitate networking;
● Find ways and means of promoting public awareness of and the importance of science and technology, in particular space technology;
● Evaluate and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of space technologies and spin-offs;
● Promote, through a variety of public awareness programmes, the use of space-related technologies;
● Facilitate, by way of incentives, the involvement and investment of the private sector in the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies.
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs, including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence.
Countries in Africa should continuously monitor and take advantage of developments in space technology within the framework of international cooperation, with the assistance of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, if necessary.
11. The Conference recommended that the following actions be undertaken within the framework of the Pretoria Memorandum on Space Technology for Africa:
(a) The Office for Outer Space Affairs should communicate the Memorandum to all African Governments and relevant institutions, including the Economic Commission for Africa, the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa, the Organization of African Unity, the African Development Bank and the Association of African Universities;
(b) The Office for Outer Space Affairs should organize, within a year, a joint leadership conference at which decision makers would be invited to discuss Africa's need to understand space technology, its role in national, social and economic development and the political will and national commitment needed to accomplish these;
(c) The Office for Outer Space Affairs should set up working groups of Africans in relevant space-technology-related disciplines.
The working groups should work with the Office for Outer Space Affairs in preparing for the above-mentioned joint leadership conference.
Relevant regional and international organizations should also be fully involved in the organization of the conference.

. In its resolution 50/27, paragraph 37, of 6 December 1995, the General Assembly considered it essential that Member States pay more attention to the problem of collisions of space objects, including nuclear power sources, with space debris, and other aspects of space debris, and called for the continuation of national research on that question, for the development of improved technology for the monitoring of space debris and for the compilation and dissemination of data on space debris.
In the same paragraph of that resolution, the Assembly considered that, to the extent possible, information thereon should be provided to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
. The General Assembly, in paragraph 21 of the same resolution, invited Member States to report to the Secretary-General on a regular basis with regard to national and international research concerning the safety of nuclear-powered satellites.
. In a note verbale dated 19 July 1996, the Secretary-General invited all Member States to communicate to the Secretariat, by 30 September 1996, the information requested above so that the Secretariat could prepare a report containing that information for submission to the Subcommittee at its thirty-fourth session.
. The present document was prepared by the Secretariat on the basis of information received from Member States as of 6 December 1996.
Information received subsequent to that date will be included in addenda to the present document.
REPLIES RECEIVED FROM MEMBER STATESThe replies are reproduced in the form in which they were received.
[Original: English]
Brunei Darussalam reports that at present it is not conducting any research relating to space debris and that it does not have satellites that operate with nuclear energy.
Consequently, studies are not being conducted on possible collisions of nuclear-power sources with space debris.
Bulgaria Bulgaria reports that at present it neither supports nor participates in space programmes involving satellites with nuclear power sources on board and does not take part in the development or launch into space of transportation systems causing the release of space debris.
Consequently, Bulgaria does not possess information on either the safety of satellites with on-board nuclear reactors or on collisions of such satellites with space debris.
Studies on the issue of space pollution have been envisaged for 1997 within the framework of the National Aerospace Programme of the Republic of Bulgaria until the year 2000. Canada
With regard to the issue of collision with space debris and practices adopted to minimize the creation of space debris the following steps have been taken.
In order to minimize the creation of space debris, the RADARSAT program undertook two specific preventative measures.
● The first consisted of establishing a system level requirement that any solid debris resulting from the operation of a restraint/release mechanism be contained. That is, all contractors were required to design a system such that no debris would be released by the spacecraft during deployments.
● The second preventative measure consisted of protecting the RADARSAT spacecraft from the existing space debris environment.
This measure was undertaken in order to ensure, to the best extent possible, that the RADARSAT spacecraft does not prematurely become space debris as a result of a space debris impact.
This activity consisted of defining the space debris environment to be encountered by RADARSAT using NASA's EnviroNET database.
Individual spacecraft components were then examined to determine their vulnerability to this predicted environment.
This vulnerability assessment included using hypervelocity impact equations as well as actually subjecting spacecraft hardware to hypervelocity impact tests at the NASA Johnson Space Center.
Where required, shielding was added to the spacecraft in order to bring the survivability of the spacecraft to an acceptable level.
The shielding included adding Nextel (a 3-M ceramic fibre cloth) to thermal blankets, adding bumpers in front of exposed hydrazine lines and wire bundles, and thickening some component boxes in order to protect their enclosed circuits. Hungary
Hungary reports that at present it is not conducting any research relating to space debris and that it does not have satellites that operate with nuclear energy.
Consequently, studies are not being conducted on possible collisions of nuclear-power sources with space debris.
A. Introduction
The Japanese Government Space Activities Commission (SAC) expressed Japan's policy on space debris in the report on Japan's Space Long Term Vision which was published in July, 1994.1
Some of the recommendations presented in the report have been taken up by the two newly formed JSASS Study Groups.
Japan (NAL, NASDA, ISAS, and other space related organizations) have also been a member of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) since 1992 and maintains a level of debris awareness through information exchanges and discussions at the IADC, IAF, COSPAR, ISCOPS and other international and domestic conferences.
This report is a brief overview of recent research progress and space debris reduction practices in Japan.
B. Recent research progress
1. SFU post-flight analysis
The JSASS study group, National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and other organizations are jointly performing the post-flight analysis of the Space Flyer Unit (SFU).
SFU is an unmanned, re-usable, sun pointing, 3-axis stabilized satellite, and constitutes the first of its kind built by Japan.
It is octagonal in shape, measures 4.46 m in diameter and 3 m in height, and weighs about 4 tons.
It was launched by the H-II third flight on March 18, 1995 and was retrieved by Shuttle STS-72 on January 13, 1996.
It occupied a circular orbit at an altitude of 500 km and inclination 28.5 degrees.
Impact surveys are making good progress - a total of 337 impact features with diameters 200-1,000 μm have so far been found, mainly on Kapton MLI and Teflon surfaces.4, 5 2. Hypervelocity impact test
The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) - which is responsible for implementing practical applications resulting from space developments in Japan - has been conducting a series of impact tests, using a two-stage hydrogen light-gas gun, for the design of the JEM Stuffed Whipple bumper and carbon fibre reinforced plastic tube for the arm of the JEM Remote Manipulator System.6
NAL has been carrying out shaped-charge tests in collaboration with MHI and Chugoku Chemicals.
The copper inhibitor, which has a hole diameter of 15 mm, was selected through intensive parametric studies of both the inhibitor method and reactive plate method.
Using this inhibitor, a single cylindrical jet without a trailing jet was obtained.
C. Space debris reduction practices NASDA has implemented the draining of residual propellants (LOX, LH2, N2H4) and residual helium gas of the H-I/H-II second stage.
The release of mechanical devices at satellite separation and solar paddle deployment has been avoided except in some particular missions such as the separation of spent apogee motors for the geostationary meteorological satellite.
In order to prevent the unintended destruction of H-II second stages in space, the command destruct system is disabled immediately after injection into orbit and its pyrotechnics are thermally insulated to preclude spontaneous initiation.8
Although the measures adopted by NASDA programs seem to be relatively inexpensive, they have been proven to be very effective.
Measures to limit space debris generation must be developed and implemented on a multilateral basis by the spacefaring nations.
The JSASS committee on space debris prevention design standards published the final report10 for NASDA standards and design criteria in March 1996.
Based on this report, NASDA established the NASDA-STD-18 "Space Debris Mitigation Standard" on March 28, 1996.11 A comparison of the guidelines and assessment procedures developed in the NASA Safety Standard 1740.14 and the NASDA Standard 18 was discussed at the 20th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, held in Gifu, Japan, May 19-20, 1996,12 and details of the standard will be presented at the 47th International Astronautical Congress in Beijing, October 7-11, 1996.13
With the aim of sharply reducing transportation costs and serving to protect the space environment, Japan will proceed with advanced R&D activities focusing on new fully-reusable transportation vehicles based on a novel design concept by upgrading the results of development of an advanced H-II launch vehicle and HOPE technologies.1
In conclusion, space environment conservation with respect to space debris is necessary to ensure long-lasting and expanding human space activities.
We need to take action now, while the space debris problem is still manageable and the costs of dealing with it are fairly low.

13A. Kato, "NASDA Space Debris Mitigation Standard", IAF-96-V.6.06, 47th IAF, Beijing, China, October 7-11, 1996. Portugal
Portugal reports that at present it does not have space objects that operate with nuclear energy.
Consequently, studies are not being conducted on possible collisions of nuclear-power sources with space debris.
The Republic of Korea reports that at present it has two KITSAT satellites and two KOREASAT satellites in orbit.
In view of the five-year operational life of the first satellite launched, KITSAT I in 1992, there will be no space debris produced by a satellite of the Republic of Korea until 1997.
With respect to national research on space debris, the Republic of Korea reports that it has initiated some preliminary research activities such as monitoring of space debris. Sweden
Sweden reports that it does not conduct any national research of its own on space debris, but supports the activities undertaken within United Nations, ESA and other fora.
Technical design studies are being carried out by industry (Saab Ericsson Space) on payload separation systems in order to mitigate the creation of new debris. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
In 1996 the British National Space Centre continued its discussions with the national space agencies of France (CNES), Germany (DARA), and Italy (ASI) and the European Space Agency on harmonization of debris activities.
This grouping has generated a report summarizing the expertise and facilities resident in Europe that are capable of addressing space debris issues.
The fourth United Kingdom Orbital Debris/Co-ordination Group Meeting was held at Matra Marconi Space in Bristol, England, on Tuesday, 14 May 1996.
This brought together academia, industry and Government, including the British National Space Centre, the British Geological Survey, Fluid Gravity Engineering, Cranfield College of Aeronautics, Advanced Systems Architectures, Century Dynamics, Matra Marconi Space, Royal Greenwich Observatory, Queen Mary and Westfield College, SIRA, Vega, the University of Kent and the Defence Research Agency.
Amongst the topics discussed and presentations given were optical and radar detection of debris in orbit, prediction of solar activity and atmospheric response, design of optical systems to detect debris, prediction of the long-term evolution of the orbital debris population, unmodelled sources of debris, the inferred microparticulate population encountered in orbit as derived from examination of retrieved space-exposed surfaces, and hydrocode modelling.
A special seminar on the challenges of using hydrocodes to model hypervelocity impacts by meteoroids and debris was also held.
The meeting was well attended and permitted discussion and coordination of national programmes with international activities such as the Inter-Agency Debris Committee and the United Nations Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
The next meeting will be held during 1997 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux, England.
A delegation from the United Kingdom attended the 13th Inter-Agency Debris Coordination Group (IADC) held from 28 February until 1 March 1996 in Darmstadt, Germany.
This was in recognition of the growing hazard of space debris and the need for an international solution to a global problem.
While the United Kingdom has been involved with the activities of the IADC from its inception, via its membership of ESA, this was the first meeting attended by the United Kingdom as independent members.
The IADC membership includes the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Russian Space Agency (RKA), the China National Space Administration (CNSA), Japan, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the French Space Agency (CNES).
Significant interest in the return of debris objects such as the China 40 (FSW-1) reentry capsule led to the United Kingdom participating in a Workshop on the Reentry of Space Debris Objects organized by the European Space Agency and held at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt on 17 September 1996.
A number of technical papers have been produced by United Kingdom research groups during 1996.
The reference section of this report lists some of the published papers.
A. Retrieved surface analysis and impact morphology
The University of Kent continues its work on retrieved surface analysis and hypervelocity impact modelling.
Numerous papers have been published on new work presenting the results of brittle material response to hypervelocity impactE.
The University of London, Queen Mary and Westfield College continues to research future debris population growth modelling,L. Wang, J.P.W. Stark and R.

A general evaluation of Austria's collaboration in ESA activities shows satisfactory results.
2. Remote Sensing Activities
An ASA working group on remote sensing is continuing to operate with the tasks of information exchange and promotion of remote sensing activities in Austria.
ASA acts as the National Point of Contact (NPOC) for the distribution of remote sensing satellite data in close co-operation with the Earthnet programme of ESA and EURIMAGE.
ASA possesses a data file of all LANDSAT images (in the form of photographic quicklooks) taken over Austrian territory.
ASA is member of the European Association of Remote Sensing Laboratories (EARSeL) and acts as national representative since June 1989.
3. Coordination of Bilateral Space Activities
Basic agreements without financial obligations exist between ASA and NASA and with the space authorities of France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and serve as a basis for co-operation. Joint space projects can be based on these agreements.
4. United Nations
ASA actively participates in the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and its Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee.
Main topics on the agenda are the applications of remote sensing from space for the needs of developing countries, the future utilization of the geostationary orbit, the safe use of nuclear power sources in space and the protection and monitoring of the environment including space debris.
B. Space research institutes
1. Austrian Academy of Sciences, Space Research Institute Graz
(a) Department of Experimental Space Research
There are four major spacecraft missions in which the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (SRI) is involved with flight hardware.
The four spacecraft mission Cluster is carried out jointly by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United States National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA).
It was aimed to probe the Earth's plasma environment with four identical spacecraft on almost identical orbits.
Its primary scientific objectives lie in the analysis of boundary layers and wave fields in the plasma environment near the Earth in three dimensions.
In 1994 and 1995 the testing of instrument hardware the spacecraft had its most active phase.
The Department contributes to Cluster with hardware for two experiments: an instrument to actively control the floating potential of the spacecraft with respect to the ambient plasma (Active Spacecraft Potential Control, ASPOC) and a fluxgate magnetometer, FGM.
The constellation between Earth and Mars favours the launch of Mars missions for 1994 or 1996.
The Space Research Institute (IKI) of the former Soviet Union initiated an international effort called Mars-94 with two almost identical spacecraft.
For a variety of reasons the missions were postponed to launch windows in 1996 and 1998, respectively.
Austria participates with hardware in both missions, namely the experiment MAREMF, a package dedicated to measure magnetic fields and electron spectra, and MARIPROBE-D, a multi-purpose, directional plasma probe.
The latter instrument is being built in co-operation with the Institute of Communications and Wave Propagation of the Technical University Graz.
The magnetometer design is based on previous experience with devices flown in the missions VEGA and PHOBOS and consists of two sensor, one inside and the other outside the spacecraft.
All of the above instruments are cooperative efforts with one or more institutes from France, the Czech Republic, Russian Federation, Hungary, Ireland, Belgium, the United States or Germany.
The mission INTERBALL consists of two pairs of satellites, one in a fairly low orbit (Auroral Probe, apogee 20,000 km) and the other with an apogee of 200,000 km (Tail Probe). These two very different orbits were chosen in order to cover the auroral and the tail region of the Earth's magnetosphere, respectively.
Each of these large satellites is accompanied by a small subsatellite in order to allow differentiation between spatial and temporal effects.
Aboard the low-apogee main satellite which is to be launched in mid-1996, the potential will be controlled by an instrument SPEX, similar to ASPOC in the Cluster mission.
The goal of SPEX is to maintain a low spacecraft potential in order to allow accurate measurements of the cold plasma components.
SPEX is a joint project of the Space Research Institute and the Research Centre Seibersdorf in collaboration with the Space Science Department of ESA/ESTEC.
The joint NASA/ESA mission CASSINI/HUYGENS to Saturn and its moon Titan, planned to be launched in 1997, will also include a lander.
In a co-operative project with institutes in Italy, Spain, France and ESTEC an experiment package HASI is being prepared which will measure physical and electrical parameters of the atmosphere in the descent phase starting at an altitude of around 170 km down to the surface.
The main experiment topics are measurements of the AC- and DC-fields, permittivity, acoustic fields and electrical relaxation time constant during descent and after impact.
At lower altitudes also data processing for an onboard altitude radar will be performed.
If the capsule survives the landing, it will also carry out measurements on Titan's surface.
Another experiment of this mission is the Aerosol Collector Pyroliser (ACP).
According to observations from the ground and the fly-by of the spacecraft Voyager, Titan is expected to have a nitrogen-methane atmosphere and - probably as a result of polymerisation of carburetted hydrogen - aerosols in it.
The ACP experiment is designed to collect, heat, and analyze atmospheric aerosols in the Titan stratosphere and upper troposphere during the descending phase of the HUYGENS capsule.
Among the scientific objectives is the determination of the composition of the aerosols and the relative abundance of its constituents, the relative abundance of condensed organic compounds, the mean size of aerosol nucleation sites and the radiative properties of low stratospheric and upper tropospheric particles.
The Prime Investigator for the ACP instrument is from the Service d'Aeronomie, CNRS, Paris.
Austria is responsible for the development of the flight electronics, the software and the complete ground test equipment.
The Austrian hardware contribution is performed under the ESA-PRODEX programme.
The Department is responsible for the technical co-ordination, Austrian industry (Joanneum Research and Schrack-Aerospace) are contractors responsible for design, manufacture and tests.
The ACP complex consists of a movable filter which serves as the aerosol collecting target, a drag fan pump to ensure the flow of the Titan atmosphere through the filter, an oven, a nitrogen gas tank, several valves and all dedicated electronics to control the system.
After the sampling procedure, the filter is retracted into the oven and isolated from the atmosphere.
By heating the filter to two different temperatures the absorbed aerosols are evaporated and carried away by nitrogen gas via an external heatable tube and transferred to the Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) instrument for further analysis.
Both flight instruments have successfully passed all tests and are ready for integration and tests at probe level.
The CASSINI spacecraft will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in October 1997 with a Titan V/Centaur launcher.
During the flight to Saturn the space-vehicle will undergo gravity assists by Venus, Earth and Jupiter.
The coast phase will start about 22 days before the Titan encounter.
After separation of the HUYGENS probe from the CASSINI spacecraft, the probe reaches Titan and enters its atmosphere.
During the entry phase the probe will be decelerated from 6.8 km/s to 300 m/s.
The atmospheric descent phase will begin with the deployment of the parachute, all instruments are released to activate their experiments.
Of the results of past missions, the one to comet Halley is still of prime interest.
In a co-operative study with NASA (Goddard) and IKI (Moscow) the relevance of solar wind structures (changes in the interplanetary magnetic field, IMF) for the so-called disconnection events (detachment of the comet's plasma tail) were studied.
Combined in-situ and ground based measurements revealed no correlation between the two phenomena which contradicts earlier computer simulations.
Another topic of interest of the Halley observations is the modulation of particle fluxes observed by both the VEGA and Giotto spacecraft.
It hitherto only appears certain that the modulation is not exclusively caused by magnetic field variations.
The numerical simulation showed the formation of condensations in the plasma tail after a 90° change in the IMF sweeping over the comet.
The mission PHOBOS to Mars and its moon Phobos provided data with a unprecedented time resolution and data from regions near Mars never explored before.
The correlation between solar wind parameters and parameters of the boundaries were investigated in detail.
It became apparent that the Martian magnetospheric tail depends in a similar way on the solar wind dynamic pressure as that of the Earth - another confirmation of the hybrid character of the solar wind-Mars interaction.
In view of the interpretation of observations obtained by the two plasma packages TAUS and ASPERA on board Phobos 2 a comparative study of particle and magnetic field data was initiated.
The numerical model of the magnetosheath was extended by incorporation of a draped field geometry within the tail, thus allowing to compute the plasma flow and magnetic field at any point around Mars.
Test particles were launched in these prescribed fields and their statistical properties analyzed.
The preliminary results are in reasonable agreement with measurements suggesting that the draped field is a meaningful first order approximation to the real Martian wake.
The search in the magnetic field data of the MISCHA experiment aboard the spacecraft VEGA 1 and 2 for phenomena in the solar wind which are thought to be relevant for processes in the coma of Comet Halley was continued.
It turned out that for such studies the necessity to simulate disturbances in the solar wind is indispensable.
In a joint endeavour with the University of Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation) an MHD code which is capable to advance perturbations in the solar wind from the solar surface into the interplanetary space was implemented.
Already first computational results demonstrated the usefulness of the code for simulating the location of sector boundaries.
By means of multi-spacecraft analysis based on data from VEGA 1/2, PHOBOS 1/2, Pioneer Venus Orbiter and IMP 8 a special magnetic field structure known as "magnetic cloud" could be identified.
The propagation of test particles in a combined magnetosheath/induced tail field geometry was studied, taking magnetic field and particle data of the magnetic field near Mars (experiment MAGMA) and automatic space plasma experiment with a rotating analyzer (experiment ASPERA) on board Phobos 2 as a basis.
It turned out that the model results only match the observations when magnetic shear stresses in addition to the convection electric field are taken into account in the equation of motion of the particles.
Hence the main features of the Martian particle environment can be understood within the framework of a pickup process with consideration of additional forces acting on the plasma.
The behaviour of the magnetic field in the close vicinity of the Mars moon Phobos in the upstream region was studied in detail.
Variations of the field direction were detected, which are not only due to variations in the solar wind. They might be caused by the interaction of the solar wind with Phobos' ionized gas or charged dust environment.
For the circular orbits, all upstream disturbances in the magnetic field were studied in the framework of foreshock physics.
Unlike at Venus or Earth, many disturbances were seen in the pure upstream region in front of, but close to the magnetic field line tangent to the bowshock.
Spacecraft observations from the Earth's magnetotail show that the flaring angle depends on the downtail distance, the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure and the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field.
Using Phobos 2 measurements, we investigated the Martian magnetotail and compared it with Earth's tail.
(b) Department of Extraterrestrial Physics
The Department is primarily involved in theoretical, but also in experimental research, covering the physics of the interplanetary medium, the interaction between the solar wind and solar system bodies, and detailed magnetospheric processes like planetary radio emission, magnetic field re-connection, solar terrestrial relationships, and planetary aeronomy, as well as the physics of comets.
Extensive measurements have been done in July 1995 during the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL 9) with Jupiter and the possible implications regarding radio burst emission.
Analogue/digital converter units, specifically designed for the digital recording of millisecond radio bursts, were integrated into a PC configuration installed at the receiving station at Kharkov (Ukraine) which comprises the world’s largest radio telescope for decameter radio waves.
However, the comet SL 9 - Jupiter collision did not yield a significant increase in decameter radio emission, but the routine Io triggered decameter radio bursts have been recorded with hitherto unprecedented time and frequency resolution.
As part of the NASA/ESA Cassini/Huygens project detailed analyses have been performed regarding the direction finding of the "Radio and Plasma Wave Science" (RPWS) experiment.
By means of so-called rheometric measurements the effective antenna length vectors could successfully be determined.
Rheometry serves as a method for the determination of the pattern of an antenna system by using a down-scaled spacecraft model immersed into a quasi-static electric field within a water-filled tank.
By rotating the model around defined axes the antenna pattern can be sampled, thus obtaining a three-dimensional characteristic pattern of the antenna system.
In the case of the Cassini/Huygens spacecraft the effective antenna length vectors deviate from their physical directions, due to the interference of the metallic spacecraft body onto the antenna system, by about 5 to 8°.
Knowledge of the electric planes of the Cassini/Huygens spacecraft is of essential importance for the whole Cassini RPWS experiment which determines the polarization and direction of arrival of radio waves (designed for the Saturn Kilometric Radiation, SKR) and provides relevant information for a number of other experiments onboard Cassini.
These research activities have been performed in close co-operation with the Cassini RPWS team (University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA).
As part of the participation in the Cassini/Huygens mission of NASA/ESA possible mechanisms for the origin and evolution of Titan's massive nitrogen atmosphere was investigated.
A model was developed comparing the possible thermal history of Triton and Pluto whose atmospheres consist like Titan’s of nitrogen and methane, allowing the estimates of methane content in Titan's atmosphere.
On the basis of previous studies on atmospheric mass loss of Titan by ‘sputtering' this method was extended to Neptune's moon Triton with the result that magnetospheric nitrogen ions and magnetic protons represent the most important loss process of molecular nitrogen from Triton.
The escape flux of nitrogen ions also contributes to the aurora of Neptune observed by Voyager 2.
Based on the study it appears that Triton has lost approximately 1,500 times its present atmospheric mass.
(c) Department of Satellite Geodesy
Austria participates with geodetic contributions in the "Global Change Program" and the "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" (IDNDR).
Basic to such investigations is the realization of an International Reference Frame (ITRF), which consists of a selected number of permanently observing geodynamic observatories and precise satellite orbits in the same ITRF for space-borne measurements such as radar altimetry.
Changes in ITRF can be attributed to global and regional crustal movements, local monitoring leads to the detection of seismic events, radar altimeters measure the vertical distance between the instantaneous sea surface as a natural reflector and the satellite in a straight-forward manner.
In order to link satellite orbits to the ITRF, the Department of Satellite Geodesy of the Space Research Institute in Graz operates the geodynamical observatory Graz-Lustbühel on a permanent basis.
It disposes of an ultra-precise Satellite Laser Ranging System (SLR), a permanently recording Global Positioning System (GPS)-receiver, a radar altimeter transponder, software expertise for GPS, laser and altimetry data reduction and processing.
It operates a data centre for serving geodynamical projects within the Central European Initiative and has carried out regional and local investigations for determining the geoid and the sea surface topography of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the movement of the Adriatic microplate, as well as crustal motions in the Eastern Alps and its correlation to local microseismics.
The activities of the laser-station Graz consists in the contribution to international projects like DOSE, ERS-1/2, TOPEX/POSEIDON, IERS, ENVISAT, GPS35/36, GLONASS, and the continuous update of the laser-station itself.
The number of tracked satellites increased from 12 in 1994 to 16 in 1995.
By now Graz attains the worldwide highest data-density for most of the tracked satellites (e.g. twice the data rate for LAGEOS-1/2).
During the 1995 about 2630 satellite passes were tracked and about 7 millions echoes recorded.
With a single-shot accuracy of 7-8 mm (ERS-1/2, GPS35/36) and a normal-point accuracy of 1 mm to all satellites Graz shares the leading position with the most accurate stations worldwide.
Special attention was paid to the compensation of "time-walk" effects down to the mm-level, to the influence of satellite signatures, and the automation of the whole tracking procedure.
Daylight measurements have been routinely carried out to all satellites whenever manpower allowed.
Within the project ENVISAT considerable efforts were undertaken to implement multi-colour laser-ranging, which should improve laser-accuracies by eliminating influences of the dry-part of the troposphere.
Two additional laser-frequencies were derived by a Raman-tube and returns successfully detected from a representative selection of satellites (including LAGEOS).
Routinely this technology is hitherto available only in Graz, it will be implemented in forthcoming new laser-systems (e.g. TIGO/Wettzell) during the next year.
In the frame of the International Geodynamics Service (IGS) the Graz observatory continued its task as a permanent GPS core station.
Two additional stations near Innsbruck (Hafelekar and Patscherkofel) have become operational in October 1994 and March 1995, respectively.
The former station is included in the IGS network, the latter acts as an additional station for monitoring local geodynamic displacements connected with microseismic events which are detected by four fully automatic seismic stations operated by the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna.
The Department carried out two autonomous GPS-campaigns (IDNDR) and participated in the campaigns, organized by a sub-project of Section C of the Central European Initiative (CEI).
The IDNDR-part covered the region of southern Austria, northern Italy, and Slovenia, as well as re-measurements of a considerable part of the Austrian Geodynamic Reference Frame (AGREF).
It was mainly designed to study the local behaviour along fault lines at the northern boundary of the Adriatic microplate.
The data/analysis centre Graz was updated for optimal automation of data management and the monitoring of remotely controlled permanent GPS-stations including the daily automatic computation of respective co-ordinates which may serve as an input to the forthcoming EUREF permanent station network.
2. Technical University Graz
(a) Institute of Communications and Wave Propagation
(i) Upper Atmospheric Research
An international rocket and ground-based campaign was conducted from the Brazilian equatorial range Alcantara in August 1994 under the leadership of NASA (Goddard and Wallops) and participation of the Universities of Colorado, Pennsylvania and Cornell.
The involvement of the Technical University Graz aboard the four sounding rocket payloads consisted of various plasma density instruments and the procurement of telescopic booms for other experimenters.
The four rockets to measure plasma densities, both absolute and with high resolution, were flown on two key days, one each near local noon, the other at midnight.
These measurements aimed at studying turbulence and other transport phenomena were accompanied by a large number of meteorological rockets equipped with falling spheres, and by MST radar measurements from the ground.
Apart from the primary scientific aims of the campaign for which the data are still being evaluated, the measurements revealed interesting differences between the results of the various plasma probes; nonetheless these rocket data are currently believed to constitute "good measurements".
Earlier flights did not carry so many redundant probes on one payload, so that one could not become aware of possible deficiencies of certain types of instruments.
The international satellite project INTERBALL comprises two large satellites, one in a fairly low orbit (Tail Probe), whereas the other is in a highly eccentric one (Aurora Probe) - see also activities of the Space Research Institute Graz.
As a specialty of this mission each of these large satellites is accompanied by a small subsatellite of the order of 50 kg.
They carry instrumentation similar to the one aboard the main satellites and are at a variable distance (up to a few thousand kilometres away) and thus allow to differentiate between spatial and temporal effects.
The original concept of these subsatellites was developed by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Prague (Czech Republic).
The involvement of the Technical University Graz in these subsatellites came rather late, such that the main participation is in upgrading the Earth station in Panská Ves (Czech Republic) and data processing and interpretation.
The first of these satellites (Tail Probe) was launched successfully on August 3, 1995.
Apart from one boom which did not deploy properly, the subsatellite yields good data which can be received from Panská Ves even at the apogee of 200,000 km.
The international mission MARS-96 under the leadership of the Russian Space Research Institute contains plasma-diagnostic instruments to study the Martian ionosphere.
In addition to the novel instrument MARIPROBE-D developed by the Space Research Institute Graz, a more conventional multi-purpose, spherical ion probe (SIP) provided by the Technical University Graz will also be flown.
Although SIP can not provide information on the spatial and energy distribution of ions, it has a much higher time resolution and is - due to its more conventional design - potentially more reliable.
The flight and the spare models have undergone qualification test and the flight model is currently being integrated into the spacecraft.
(ii) Timekeeping and Satellite Communications
The main aim is to develop and study high precision and accurate time transfer methods by satellite techniques.
One-way methods using the signals distributed by the Global Positioning System (GPS) in common-view mode and two-way techniques employing pseudo-noise(PN)-signals distributed via communication satellites were investigated.
Since 1988, two single-frequency GPS receivers of different types are operated at TUG in an air-conditioned laboratory.
From late 1989 to the middle of 1995 both receivers were in continuous operation using a common-clock set-up thus enabling the study of the behaviour of the differential delay of the receivers.
The differential delay (daily mean of the differences of all tracks recorded according to the BIPM common-view tracking schedule) shows a seasonal behaviour, but the character is changing over the time and there is no obvious correlation with outside temperature; the same applies to humidity.
Further studies are clearly necessary.
In August 1993, two-way time transfer line-up tests via the 53° INTELSAT satellite were performed between six European laboratories and followed by two-way measurements between a varying number of stations using different measurement schedules.
In February 1994 two-way measurements began on a regular basis - the so-called INTELSAT field trials - between the above mentioned European laboratories and between these laboratories and two laboratories in the United States.
At TUG, all measurements were done using a 1.8 m VSAT-satellite terminal which is INTELSAT and EUTELSAT approved.
Since 1994 a satellite simulator is included allowing individual measurement of the difference of the transmit and receive delays in conjunction with each time transfer measurement.
The data obtained can immediately be used to correct the two-way satellite time and frequency data for variations of the differential signal delay of the station.
The Institute of Applied Systems Technology in close cooperation with the Institute of Communications and Wave Propagation developed a novel satellite video conference system for the European Space Agency in the framework of the DICE (Direct Inter-Establishment Communications Experiment).
In contrast to conventional systems it can support multiple sites simultaneously.
Special data transmission are provided to distribute documents electronically during the session.
Total of 21 stations are now in operations in Europe and form two networks.
One is used by Matra-Marconi Space for business communications between five sites in the UK and two in France, the other setup by ESA has been heavily used for support of the EUROMIR-94 and 95 missions to the MIR space station.
The mission control centre near Moscow and the Cosmonauts' training centre in Star City have been connected with the ESA establishments (ESTEC, EAC, ESOC, ESA HQ) and the control centres Toulouse and Oberpfaffenhofen, respectively.
The conduct of the mission was entirely managed and controlled remotely and proved the successful concept of DICE for telescience applications.
DICE will also be used for the French CASSIOPEE mission in summer 1996.
Further enhancements of DICE, such as an ISDN gateway and a FEAL encryption system are currently under development.
As part of the CODE (Co-operative OLYMPUS Data Experiment) a novel portable communications system for Ka-band (20/30 GHz) has been developed by Joanneum Research in collaboration with Technical University Graz, Telefonica Sistemas and SIRE (Spain) under contract by ESA.
The system supports vocoded voice or data at rates of 4.8 kbit/s.
All communications equipment (modem, notebook PC, telephone handset) together with a 35 cm parabolic antenna are integrated into a briefcase.
A built-in GPS receiver facilitates pointing of the antenna and provides positioning information.
The primary network topology is a star, using a central inexpensive mini-hub station (dish size 1.5 - 2.4 m).
Mesh mode of operations (from terminal to terminal) is also possible.
In that case the small hub station has the function of monitoring and network control only.
The initial system has been designed to be compatible with OLYMPUS, the European DFS-KOPERNIKUS and ITALSAT.
A Ku-band version (12/14 GHz) with 50 cm dish, compatible with EUTELSAT or INTELSAT, is also planned.
The transmission scheme has been made compatible with the relevant ETSI recommendations.
Applications of the systems are communications in areas with inadequate terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure, Internet access, collection of environmental data and emergency communications.
Since Ku- and Ka-band capacity are considerably cheaper than L-band (used for the INMARSAT-M system), this Picoterminal is also interesting from an economic point of view.
The field trials start in June 1996 in co-operation with Deutsche Telekom.
Another trial in co-operation with Telespazio follows, using ITALSAT in the second half of 1996.

Diffraction limited multi-spectral images of the asteroid 4 Vesta have been obtained in the near IR at ESO-La Silla station.
These pictures have an effective spatial resolution of 0.1" and complement nicely a series of HST-FOC images in red light obtained at 24 different rotation phases of Vesta.
Supporting ground based photometry has also been obtained at ESO.
(b) Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics
Observations of the Differential Doppler effect on the signals of the polar orbiting US Navy Navigation Satellites (NNSS) continued.
The measurements provide the latitude dependence of ionospheric electron content (TEC).
The data base collected at Graz also includes the results of the NNSS observations made at the Max-Planck-Institute for Aeronomy, Lindau/Harz, Germany.
At the beginning of 1995 two receiving stations were put into operation in Italy (Gibilmanna/Sicily and L'Aquila) by IROE Florence and close co-operation in evaluation and interpretation of the results was established.
By the end of 1995 NNSS receiving equipment went into operation at DLR Neustrelitz/Germany.
Joint evaluation programs now exist to make optimal use of all data gathered in the longitude sector 10°E to 15°E.
In Graz, the European electron content data are used for three purposes: investigations of "geophysical events" (geomagnetic storm effects, Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances, etc.), long-term studies (ionospheric modelling, solar cycle effects, etc.) and calculation of radio wave propagation effects (error assessment for geodetic and radioastronomical applications, error corrections, etc.).
The Institute participates in several international corporations.
We name here COST251 (the successor of the COST238/PRIME) a European project with the title "Improved Quality of Service in Ionospheric Telecommunication Systems Planning and Operation" and TECUA (Total Electron Content for Upper Atmosphere Investigations) which is a German - Argentinean - Austrian co-operation.
In 1994, the Institute also started research in the field of remote sensing of the atmosphere from space for studies of climate and weather, especially in connection with the use of the GPS/GLONASS-based radio-occultation technique for profiling and imaging of the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere and with passive microwave sounding.
The Institute is involved in several international scientific consortia in this context, a major part of the work being done in close co-operation and under contract with ESA/ESTEC (Earth Observation Preparatory Programme).
4. University of Innsbruck
The "Dust in born-again Planetary Nebulae", and "Edge-on Dust Disks in Planetary Nebulae" programmes received observing time on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) satellite.
The first project aims at observing the centres of some old, evolved planetary nebulae (PNe) harbouring a hot central star which has recently ejected highly processed hydrogen-poor material.
We investigate the physical properties of very hot dust that has formed and survived in this hostile environment.
The second project investigates evolved PNe which show a bipolar morphology with a pronounced dust disk, seen edge-on.
Spatially resolved images shall be recorded with ISOCAM in order to understand the distribution, properties and physical state of he dust grains.
Both projects will be supplemented by several ground-based observations.
The main research activities were concerned with methods and applications of Earth observation from space for hydrology and cryospheric research.
Spaceborne experiments in combination with field activities at test sites in the Austrian Alps focused on microwave signature research and on the development of methods for SAR data analysis.
Earth observation satellite data were applied for studies of glacier/climate interactions in Antarctica and Southern Argentina, and for hydrological research in the Alps.
On the sensor side, emphasis has been on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), in the frame of the ERS-1 and ERS-2 Missions of ESA and of the Synthetic Aperture Radar-C (SIR-C)/X-SAR Experiment of NASA/DLR/ASI.
The following experiments have been carried out as Principal Investigator:
● ERS-1 Experiment Nr. A1: "Snow and ice properties by ERS-1 AMI SAR data". ● ERS-1 Experiment Nr.
A2: "Active microwave signatures of the polar ice sheets based on ERS-1 AMI data".
● ERS-1/ERS-2 Experiment AO2.A101 "Comparative investigations of climate sensitivity and dynamics of glaciers in Antarctica, Patagonia, and the Alps".
● SIR-C/X-SAR Experiment: "The High Alpine SAR Experiment".
The ERS-1 Experiments Nr. A1 and A2 were completed in 1995.
Within these experiments a method was developed for generating digital snow cover maps in mountain areas based on multi-temporal SAR data, and the usefulness of ERS-1 SAR-derived snow cover maps for runoff modelling in alpine drainage basins was demonstrated.
ERS-1 AMI scatterometer mode was found to provide valuable information also over land surfaces.
The scatterometer was applied for mapping snow and ice morphology over Antarctica and for soil moisture mapping over the Canadian Prairies.
The most remarkable observation was the rapid collapse of two sections of northern Larsen Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula, within a few days in January 1995 which was analyzed in detail by means of close time sequences of ERS-1 SAR images.
A disintegration event of this type has never been observed before.
The rapidity of the collapse implies that ice shelves may respond much faster to climatic change than anticipated.
Further investigations on ice dynamics, on glacier/climate relation, and on snow hydrology are going on within the ERS-1/ERS-2 Experiment AO2. A101 in Antarctica and on the Patagonian Icefield in cooperation with the Instituto Antarctico Argentino and with the German Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research.
In April 1994 as well as in October 1994, five swathes were acquired over the Ötztaler Alpen in Austria by SIR-C/X-SAR which operated on board of the Space Shuttle Endeavour providing polarimetric radar data at 1.25 GHz and 5.3 GHz, and VV-polarized data at 9.6 GHz.
During both flights a near real time analysis was carried out over glaciers to determine the accumulation and ablation areas and estimate glacier mass balance, important parameters for climate research and hydrology.
The investigations after the flights were aimed at the relations between physical target properties and polarimetric radar measurements and at the development of classification methods for complex terrain.
Interferometric studies were carried out over glaciers in Patagonia with SIR-C and X-SAR data which were acquired in one day repeat intervals.
L-band data were applied successfully for mapping ice velocities even over melting ice surfaces and in heavily crevassed zones, emphasizing the high potential of SAR for studies of ice dynamics.

The impacts of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 fragments on Jupiter caused the formation of micron-sized dust particles.
On Galileo pictures, they appeared as conspicuous Earth-sized dark spots in visual and UV light.
Based on a time-dependent description of dust formation, condensation of amorphous carbon grains (soot) was proposed as a mechanism to provide particles with the observed properties.
The question whether carbon or silicate grains will form critically depends on the chemical composition of the Jovian atmosphere.
If the abundance analysis of the Galileo Probe data supports a carbon-rich environment at the impact sites our model demonstrates that there is enough time to grow amorphous carbon grains in the fireballs rising immediately after the impacts.
Due to a delay of the launch of MARS-94 to November '96, additional resources became available for the EVRIS experiment.
A larger photometric telescope was built which allows to observe even fainter target stars.
The new flight hardware was successfully tested and delivered to LAS (Marseille).
In addition, the Institute participated in studies for future ESA (STARS) and CNES (COROT) astronomy missions related to asteroseismology.
A reply to an ESA Announcement of Opportunity for an X-Ray Multiple Mirror (XMM) Survey Scientist Centre led to the involvement on a co-investigator (Co-I) level.
This centre will perform the automatic pipeline processing of all the XMM data from all experiments.
In addition, it will undertake the systematic analysis with respect to the field survey archive data leading to the production of catalogues of all serendipitous sources detected by XMM, and it will organise follow-up ground and space based observations.
Three project proposals for the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) were granted a total of 87,000 seconds of observing time.
For "Spectral Variability of Long Period Variables" a number of selected objects will be repeatedly observed over the whole pulsation cycle.
"Atmospheric Structure of Oxygen-Rich Semiregular Variables" aims at a comparison of stars with different pulsational characteristics, both with respect to the dust emission and the molecular features sensitive to the stratification of the photospheres.
Both projects use the short wavelength spectrometer and deal with the interaction between pulsation, atmospheric structure and dust formation.
The third project "Dust and Gas Environment of Lambda-Bootis Stars" shall clarify whether the chemical surface abundances are caused by a mass loss - diffusion process of these peculiar stars or by accretion from the interstellar matter.
A Co-I participation in the program "Mass-Loss and Evolution of AGB Stars in the LMC" will focus on the IR emission of variable AGB stars using ISOCAM.
Furthermore, collaboration with various ISO instrument teams will provide access to guaranteed time observations.
A noise model for the Fine-Guidance-Sensors (FGS) of the Hubble-Space-Telescope (HST) was developed which allows for an automatic survey of all FGS Data concerning variability of guide stars.
The main scientific objective of this survey is to investigate microvariability in a large parameter space of the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and to determine astrophysical boundary conditions for stellar instabilities.
The analysis of Faint-Object-Camera (FOC) and the Wide-Field-Planetary-Camera (WFPC) images showed that the cores of most elliptical galaxies contain a non-resolved central source which is often embedded in a gas/dust disk.
The central point-like source, which is particularly bright in the UV wavelength range, is interpreted in terms of a super massive black hole (108 to 109 solar masses).
In one galaxy the UV bright central source was observed to brighten by a factor of 7 over a period of 2 years, probably due to the disruption of a star passing by the black hole.
The active K0 IV star HU Virginis was observed with the High-Resolution Imager onboard the X-ray satellite ROSAT in the time between June 15 and July 12, 1994, and a gigantic x-ray flare was caught in the flare-onset phase.
(b) Institute of Geochemistry
New lunar meteorites recovered from Antarctica were analysed in collaboration with the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna.
In addition, several members of the rare and previously not well studied meteorite group of iodranites were studied in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Bern (Switzerland).
The collaboration with the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna and the Centre de Spectrometrie Masse et Spectrometrie Nuclaire, Orsay (France) on the study of micrometeorites from Antarctic blue ice is progressing well.
Trace element analyses on numerous small micrometeorites were performed using neutron activation analysis, followed by scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analysis.
The result of this work showed that Antarctic micrometeorites are a separate class of extraterrestrial material, with properties that are different from those of known meteorite classes and interplanetary dust particles.
Several meteorite impact craters and impact products have been studied, including materials from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, which is currently believed to be the crater responsible for the mass extinctions at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary 65 million years ago.
Another structure that was thoroughly studied is the Manson crater in Iowa, USA.
The crater is currently covered by sediments, and has recently been extensively drilled.
The results of an international consortium that studied drill core samples from the structure were published as a book by the Geological Society of America.
In addition, detailed research (field and laboratory studies) was performed on various impact craters around the world.
These craters include: Chesapeake Bay (United States - demonstrating the impact origin of this 90 km diameter structure, and showing that a link with the 35 million year old North American tektite strewn field is very likely); Red Wing Creek and Newporte (North Dakota, United States); Ames (Oklahoma, United States); Saltpan and Kalkkop (South Africa); Roter Kamm (Namibia); Highbury (Zimbabwe); Gardnos (Norway), and others.
Also studied were the isotopic composition of various tektites (rare natural glasses that form in meteorite impacts).
Work on the rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) isotopic system as indicator of the presence of an extraterrestrial component in impact-derived materials was continued.
Most of the research is done in collaboration with national and international research institutions.
6. Museum of Natural History, Vienna
(a) Department of Mineralogy-Petrography
In spite of the concentration of its resources on the study of cosmic dust (micrometeorites), the Department was able to investigate a large spectrum of meteoritic or planetary subjects.
The main mass of infalling matter on Earth is related to rare meteorite classes (CM and CR carbonaceous chondrites) but has mineralogical and bulk chemical features of its own.
Thus, the interplanetary dust is not represented by any of the meteorites in our collections and in all likelihood micrometeorites represent the silicate portion of comets.There is still no consensus on the origin of these crystalline melt droplets after which the most common meteorites, the chondrites, are named.
The results of continuous studies of the mineralogy, geochemistry, and isotope geochemistry of single chondrules (diameter: 500 μm) support a nebular origin but indicate disturbances in the isotopic systems at times long after the formation of the solar system.
The very unusual Kaidun chondrite is a chondrite breccia consisting of a variety of highly oxidized and highly reduced lithologies.
It demonstrates mixing of lithologies from very different regions of the solar nebula.
Detailed studies of the constituents should provide for physical-chemical constraints for the diverse formation regions.
7. Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf
(a) Department for Physics
For the NASA mission Equator-S, Seibersdorf provides the ion emitter modules for the S/C charge compensation system.
Two ion emitter modules have been built and are now undergoing extensive tests at Seibersdorf.
The charge compensation system for GEOTAIL which Seibersdorf together with ESA and ISAS developed for this Japanese spacecraft is now going into its fourth year of flawless operation.
Data on ion emitter operation are continuously being evaluated and show excellent operational behaviour of the system.
Charge control is working as expected at 10 μA ion emission current, so that similarly good operation can be expected for the CLUSTER mission.
Seibersdorf, together with Joanneum Research (JR) in Graz and RKK ENERGIYA/Kaliningrad is developing the space-qualified ion microprobe MIGMAS which will be installed 1997 as permanent equipment on the Russian space station MIR: Onboard of MIR it will form the centre of a materials analytical laboratory for investigation of space exposure effect on materials.
In 1995 the engineering model of the materials analysis section of MIGMAS has been completed and is currently undergoing performance tests.
Seibersdorf, together with JR Graz participated in the EUROMIR 94 and EUROMIR 95 - missions of ESA.
Experiments were performed in preparation for the installation of the microanalysis station MIGMAS on MIR in 1997.
Materials returned from MIR were analysed and characterised at Seibersdorf and showed the good conditions of MIGMAS components after 3 years of operation onboard the space station.
8. The Austrian Society for Aerospace Medicine & Life Sciences
Following the successful completion of the AUSTROMIR project, the Principal Medical Investigators approached the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science, Transport and Arts seeking support to continue activities in the space medicine domain - to this end the Austrian Society for Aerospace Medicine & Life Sciences in Space (ASM) was established in 1991.
Essentially, ASM was founded to provide a basis for multi-disciplinary approaches to spaceflight bio-medical research.
ASM is to act as a platform where diagnostic, prognostic and elective, operational and preventative countermeasures can be developed e.g. health status monitoring, space sickness, crew compliance, food supply, ergonomics and de-conditioning counter measures.
The major areas of research are: Life Sciences, Neurology, Physiology and Radiobiology.
Most recently, ASM has at the invitation of its Russian partner institution, the Institute for Bio-Medical Problems (IMBP) in Moscow, contributed 9 medical experiments within the Russian Long-term Flight (RLF) project.
This flight constituted part of the Russian National Space Programme and was the longest spaceflight to date performed by the Russian Physician Cosmonaut Valery V. Polyakov totalling a duration of 437 days and 17 hours.
During his stay on the Space Station MIR, Dr. Polyakov and rotating crews made regular use of the ASM medical experiments, these being the only medical experiments used over the entire period of Dr. Polyakov's stay on-board the Space Station MIR.
The scientific/medical part of the complete RLF Project was managed, controlled and coordinated by the IMBP on the Russian side.
Similarly, on the Austrian side, ASM has prime responsibility.
The following table gives a brief overview of the missions, during which Austrian medical experimentation was performed since AUSTROMIR:

CZECH REPUBLIC This report deals with three selected activities: the microaccelerometric measurements, the continuation of the MAGION programme of small satellites and applications of remote sensing.
A. The microaccelerometer
Methods for accelerometric measurements are being developed at the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
The aim is to detect and measure non-gravitational forces affecting the motion of artificial satellites.
The instrument is a three-axial electrostatically compensated microaccelerometer with a cubic proof-mass.
Its prototype has been developed at the Astronomical Institute but the following models have been manufactured by an industrial group.
The prototype was successfully tested on board of a spacecraft launched by the Russian Federation in 1992.
Another model has been prepared for a flight on the STS-79 Atlantis, in collaboration with the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
The space shuttle Atlantis with the accelerometer on board was launched on September 16, 1996.
The results of the accelerometric experiment were not known at the time of writing the report.
The main goal of this project is to test the accelerometer with respect to measurements by other similar devices placed in the scientific rack on the STS Atlantis.
The preparation of the accelerometer was effected during 1995-1996.
It is a further qualification test of the accelerometer before it will be mounted on board of scientific satellites.
The first of them will be the satellite "CESAR" which is now being prepared in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency ASI and with agencies of other Central European countries.
The project is aimed at atmospheric, ionospheric and magnetospheric studies.
It is at present in phase B an the satellite is envisaged to be launched in 1999.
It might be possible to determine, besides the atmospheric effects, also the effects of direct and reflected solar radiation pressure and of the infrared radiation of the Earth, as well as the respective radiative fields.
The proposed satellite will be a small body (60 cm diameter) of a regular shape, preferably spherical.
In order to reduce the disturbing effects of other instruments, the accelerometer will be the only instrument on board.
The expected time span of collecting data will be at least 4 years.
B. The MAGION series of small satellites
The scientific programme based on small satellites of the MAGION-type has continued in the course of 1995-1996 in two main directions:
This activity - which was carried out in international cooperation - resulted in a large number of scientific papers.
For example, at the COSPAR 1996 Symposia in Birmingham, 42 papers based on the results of MAGION 2 and 3 experiments were presented.
(b) The two following MAGION-type satellites have been launched in the framework of the INTERBALL international cooperation mission aimed at the study of the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere and of physical processes in different parts of the Earth's magnetosphere.
The first pair of the INTERBALL mission satellites, the INTERBALL 1 and MAGION 4, were launched on 3 August 1995 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome.
The high elliptical "Tail" orbit with an apogee of 193.000 km allowed to study during the first year in orbit the magnetopause and bowshock regions as well as the tail region of the magnetosphere using the two-point simultaneous measurements.
The maneuvering capability of MAGION 4 was successfully used to control and optimize the distance between INTERBALL 1 and MAGION 4.
Measurements by the two spacecraft in the "Tail" orbit continue. They have been extended by the second pair of INTERBALL mission spacecraft, the INTERBALL 2 and MAGION 5, launched on 29 August 1996 into the "Auroral" orbit with an apogee of 20,000 km
C. Remote Sensing Activities in 1994-1996
National activities in remote sensing have been focused on various kinds of applications.
Environment, forestry, agriculture and cartography are the main fields where remote sensing is applied together with geoinformation.
Two nationwide projects have been undertaken in the country.
One is the mapping CORINE Land Cover project accomplished in the framework of the PHARE Programme.
It includes production of the digital database of land cover units over the entire country at a scale of 1:100000.
The data have been obtained by visual interpretation of Landsat TM geocoded images followed by digitalization.
In total, nine scenes have been used to cover the Czech Republic.
The database will be consistent with similar products elaborated in other European countries. The database is being used in various applications like soil degradation assessment or more accurate pollution modelling.
In the follow-up of the project, the method and corresponding nomenclature has been developed to mapped land cover in a more detailed scale of 1:50000.
The method was tested on an area of about 10.000 sq.km.
The second large project gives fast information about crop areas to the Ministry of Agriculture.
Based on classification of the Landsat or Spot satellite imagery, the information provided updates averages of the main crops on regional or district levels.
Due to the cloud coverage it is not possible to get the information over the whole country during one vegetation season.
Simultaneously, NOAA low resolution data were used to study the dynamics of the vegetation development during the season and to assess its phenological stage.
Traditionally, satellite data play an important role in monitoring conditions of the forest.
Landsat TM scenes are processed to get maps presenting the distribution of different stages of damaged forests.
The first complete map of the forest health stages of the country based entirely on satellite data has been prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1995.
In another project, Landsat TM data were processed on the area of two test sites of 20 x 25 km each for forest ecosystem mapping.
Almost 20 classes have been detected distinguishing different forest types in combination with forest management practices.
Space maps are used in a growing number of cases by local district offices.
Production of the maps is done routinely using topographic maps and a set of ground control points.
The standard size of one map sheet of various scales is available on commercial basis.
It can be obtained in printing as well as in digital format ready for direct input to GIS.
New activities are connected with usage of radar data.
ERS-1 and ERS-2 data have been used for the production of space map at the scale of 1:200,000.
The image map provides a base for geological and geomorphological analysis of the area along a new oil pipeline construction.
Stereo Spot panchromatic scenes have been processed to obtain a digital elevation model.
The PC software has been applied to get grid model description with a spatial resolution of 20 m and an error in elevation of 10-20 m. ECUADOR

INDIA India made substantial progress during the last one year in the development and application of technology aimed at rapid socio-economic development of the country.
India also continued to further enhance international cooperation in exploration and peaceful uses of outer space.
A. INSAT System
India successfully launched INSAT-2C, the third satellite in the indigenously-built INSAT-2 series, on December 7, 1995.
INSAT is a multi-purpose satellite system for telecommunication, television broadcasting, meteorology, disaster management and search and rescue.
INSAT-2C has now joined the other three satellites of the INSAT system launched earlier, namely, INSAT-1D, the last of the INSAT-1 series, and the indigenously built INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B, in vastly enhancing the space segment capacity.
INSAT-2C provides additional services like mobile satellite communication, corporate communication in Ku-band and extended coverage for Indian television broadcasting.
India plans to launch the follow-on satellites in the INSAT-2 series, namely, INSAT-2D, identical to INSAT-2C, during 1996-97 and INSAT-2E, carrying advanced meteorological payloads in adciition to communication payloads during 1997-98.
Eleven transponders on INSAT-2E are to be leased to the International Telecommunication Satellite Organisation, INTELSAT.
India continues to employ INSAT system for broadcasting educational programmes at school and college levels.
A channel has been exclusively reserved on INSAT system for interactive developmental education and training, especially in the rural areas.
A two-year pilot project for practical demonstration of satellite-based developmental communication and training network for rural upliftment has been taken up in a tribal district of Madhya Pradesh in Central India.
B. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System (IRS)
India had two major achievements during the last one year in the field of satellite-based remote sensing - one was the successful launch of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-1C, the third satellite in the IRS-1 series, on December 28, 1995, by a Russian Molniya rocket from Kazakstan and the other was the successful launch of IRS-P3, on board the Indian-built Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV, on March 21, 1996.
Thus, today, India has a constellation of four remote sensing satellites, IRS-1B, IRS-1C, IRS-P2 and IRS-P3, which are providing a variety of space-based remote sensing data.
IRS-1C is a more advanced satellite compared to its predecessors providing a high spatial and spectral resolution, stereo-viewing and on-board data recording capability.
IRS-P3 carries on board a Modular Opto-Electronic Scanner designed and built by the German Space Agency, DLR, in addition to the payloads built by India for remote sensing and X-ray astronomy.
India plans to launch the follow-on satellite in the IRS-1 series namely, IRS-1D, identical to IRS-1C, during 1997-98.
Another series of satellites known as IRS-P series have also been planned for applications like ocean resources survey, high resolution mapping and environmental monitoring.
IRS-P4, carrying oceanography payload, is scheduled for launch during 1997-98.
Data from IRS satellites is being put to use for several applications in the country like agricultural crop acreage and yield estimation, drought management and assessment, flood mapping, landuse and land cover mapping, wasteland management, ocean/marine resources survey, urban planning, mineral prospecting, forest resources survey and management.
Data from IRS satellites is also available to the world user community through a US company.
C. Integrated mission for sustainable development
The implementation of locale-specific action plans under the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD), which was launched in 1992, continues to make further progress.
IMSD, coordinated by the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) under the Department of Space, mainly uses data from IRS satellites and other collateral socio-economic data.
The mission now covers 174 districts in the country and, specifically, 92 blocks have been identified for generation of action plans on priority for integrated development of land anti water resources.
D. Launch vehicle technology
A major achievement in the last one year has been the completion of the developmental flights of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) with the successful third developmental launch on March 21, 1996, when PSLV placed the 922 kg Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P3, in the intended 817 km polar sunsynchronous orbit.
Thus, India has now achieved self-reliance for launching IRS class of 1,000-1,200 kg remote sensing satellites.
Substantial progress has also been made in the development of Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, GSLV, including its cryogenic upper stage.
GSLV will enable India to launch 2,000-2,500 kg class of communication satellites into the geosynchronous transfer orbit.
The first developmental flight of this vehicle is expected to take place in 1997/98.
E. Progress in space science
The launch of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P3, carrying an X-ray astronomy payload, has provided further encouragement to high energy astronomy in the country.
The gamma-ray burst experiment payload and the retarding potential analyser payload on board SROSS-C2 satellite, launched in 1994, continues to provide valuable data to the scientists.
The National Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar Facility (NMRF) near Tirupati, in southern India is fully operational and is benefiting the study of various characteristics of upper earth atmosphere.
India has initiated a Solar Terrestrial Energy Programme (STEP) which will form an important contribution to the international science campaign in this field.
F. International cooperation
India continues to pursue cooperation in space with several countries.
Under a cooperative agreement, IRS-P3 satellite, launched by India in March 1996, carried on board a Modular Opto-Electronic Scanner designed and developed by DLR of Germany.
The inauguration of the UN Asia-Pacific Regional Centre for Space Education in India in November 1995 is a significant milestone.
The first course on Remote Sensing and GIS has already begun at the Centre, which has been established at Debra Dun in India.
In this course, 26 students from 15 developing countries are taking part.
Under the Sharing of Experience in Space (SHARES) programme, India continues to train personnel from developing countries in space science and applications.
G. Conclusion
With the successful launches of INSAT-2C, IRS-IC and IRS-P3, India continued to enhance the application of space technology for national development in the areas of telecommunication, television broadcasting, meteorology, disaster warning, search and rescue services and, resources survey and management.
India has also achieved self-reliance for launching the IRS class of satellites with the success of PSLV-D3 during the year.
The inauguration and start of the first training course under the UN Asia-Pacific Regional Centre for Space Education and the successful launch of a payload from DLR Germany on board India's IRS-P3 signify the importance India attaches to international cooperation in space.
IRELAND A. The LION Instrument on SOHO
On December 2, 1995 NASA launched a $l billion European Space Agency spacecraft called SOHO (The Solar Heliospheric Observatory) on a mission to investigate the Sun.
Among the sophisticated, state of the art instruments onboard is the Irish national Low Energy Ion Detector LION, which was designed/ constructed mainly at Space Technology Ireland, Ltd. (STIL).
LION was first switched on during the evening of Thursday, December 7, 1995.
B. The RAPID Instrument on CLUSTER
The CLUSTER Mission involves four identical spacecraft designed to compositely monitor, in different geo-regimes, subtle changes in the interaction between the Earth and the Sun.
Included in the payload of each of the four spacecraft is the instrument RAPID, which is an imaging energetic particle spectrometer.
RAPID was developed under the aegis of an international consortium lead by the Max Planck Institut für Aeronome at Lindau, Germany.
Due to the failure of the Ariane V rocket during its first launch in May 1996, the outboard CLUSTER spacecraft constellation was lost. Plans are presently under development for a rescue mission (C-5), and the RAPID instrument will be included in the payload of any replacement spacecraft associatively flown.
The WAVES instrument on NASA's WIND spacecraft, to which STIL made significant design/construction inputs for an international consortium lead by the Departement de Recherche Spatiale, Paris, France, continues, since its launch in 1994, to return important data to Earth concerning radio and plasma processes in the solar atmosphere.
D. The Russian Mission to Planet Mars
A Russian space mission is scheduled for launch to planet Mars in November, 1996.
Included in the payload is the Irish national instrument SLED-II, which has been designed and built by STIL to investigate in greater depth energetic particle populations discovered close to Mars by the first Irish SLED instrument on the Phobos Mission to Mars and its Moons (1988/89).
Ireland is also the official manufacturer of the Mars-96 Mariprobe (cold plasma) instrument on behalf of an international consortium lead by the Space Research Institute at Moscow, Russia.
Mariprobe would investigated, for the first time, the nightside ionosphere of Mars.
STIL has further designed and constructed a fault tolerant data processing unit for the FONEMA instrument.
This is an ultra high speed ion composition analyser which should investigate plasma processes in the Martian neighbourhood for an international consortium lead by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, England.
E. The Energetic Particle Monitor on NASA's Relativity Mission
STIL has recently been awarded, in international competition, a prestigious contract (the first of its kind in Ireland) to design and build a high energy proton detector and data processing unit for Stanford University, California.
This instrument will fly on NASA's Gravity Probe B (Relativity) Mission, which is designed to test important aspects of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
This spacecraft is scheduled for launch before the turn of the century.
Gravity Probe B will investigate two key predictions of Albert Einstein's General Theory, namely that space and time are warped by the presence of the Earth and that the Earth's rotation drags space-time around with it.
So precise will the measurements be, that the tiny changes produced by the warping of space-time can be detected by onboard equipment with an accuracy equivalent to the width of a human hair seen from a distance of 160 km.
These delicate measurements can be disturbed by electrical charging and heating effects produced by very high energy particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field and by energetic particles produced in association with the explosive events on the Sun called solar flares.
Monitoring and taking account of the influence of such high energy particles is essential to the successful recording of the precise measurements required to test Einstein's Theory.
This essential monitoring task will be carried out by the Space Technology instrument using a state of the art design featuring high reliability, fault tolerant, electronics.
F. A High Energy Electron Monitor for ESA
STIL, under contract to the European Space Agency, has successfully designed and delivered the electronic and mechanical breadboard of a high energy electron monitor for ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, Holland.
This lightweight, low cost detector, which requires minimal onboard resources for its operation, has been designed to fly on the next generation of European mini and micro satellites.
G. Future Plans
1. Space Plant Biology
Collaborative activity between STIL and G. Hyenga of NASA/Ames Research centre has been initiated, with a view to developing areas of plant habitat subsystem design, and plant natural production formations specific to long term flight conditions.

JAPAN A. National organizations for space activities
1. Space Activities Commission
The Space Activities Commission (SAC) was established within the Office of the Prime Minister in 1968 under the Law for the Establishment of the space Activities Commission.
Its purpose was to unify the space activities of various government agencies and actively promote them.
SAC formulates plans, deliberates and takes decisions on the matters listed below, and submits its opinions to the Prime Minister, whose decision is guided by the opinion of SAC thus submitted.
The matters dealt with by SAC are as follows:
● Important policy matters relating to space activities;
● Important matters bearing on the coordination of space-related affairs among the government agencies concerned;
● The estimate for space activity budget of the government agencies concerned;
● Matters relating to the fundamental policy of the education and training of space researchers and engineers (excluding instruction and research at universities or colleges);
● Other important matters concerning space activities.
SAC consists of five persons noted for their learning, nominated by the Prime Minister following approval by the Diet, and including the Minister of State for Science and Technology serving as Chairman.
Its secretariat functions are performed by the Space Policy division of the Research and Development Bureau of the Science and Technology Agency (STA).
2. Science and Technology Agency
STA established the Space Science and Technology Preparation Office in July 1959.
In July 1964, STA set up the National Space Development Centre to serve as the primary promoter of space activities in Japan.
Attracting able personnel from industry, the academic world and Government, and maintaining flexible budgetary and organizational procedures are necessary to ensure the full and effective implementation of space activities.
To that end, STA reorganized the National Space Development Centre into the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, a special entity under the law, in operation since 1969.
STA now plans and promotes basic space-related policy and the overall coordination of space activities among government agencies, and conducts research and development activities through the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), a research organization attached t it, and NASDA.
It thereby plays the central role in the space activities of Japan.
As the secretariat of SAC, STA also maintains liaison and conducts negotiations between various government agencies, thereby allowing smooth and effective development and utilization of space science and technology.
3. National Aerospace Laboratory
NAL, formerly called the National Aeronautical Laboratory, was established in July 1955 as a subsidiary organization of the Office of the Prime Minister to expedite the development of aeronautical technology in Japan.
After the establishment of STA in 1956, NAL was placed under its administration.
In 1963, NAL was charged with the additional task of conducting research in space technology and renamed National Aerospace Laboratory.
NAL established its Rocket Division in 1963 and its Kakuda Research Centre in 1966 to allow research on a broader scale.
The Rocket Division was reorganized into the Space Technology Research Group in October 1969 to encourage progress in space research within a stronger, more fully structured organization.
Since then, the Space Technology Research Group and the Kakuda Research Centre have played a dominant role in the development of space technology in NAL, although close cooperation with other divisions is occasionally required.
Most NAL divisions are conducting research on key technologies for winged systems of space transport, which NAL considers essential to the pursuit of autonomous space activities by Japan in the coming century.
NAL has strong connections with NASDA, with which it jointly conducts various experiments required for the development of space technology.
NAL offers its research data to other organizations to promote further progress in that area, and undertakes basic as well as advanced studies which are considered to be essential to future development.
The liquid oxygen turbopump developed at the Kakuda Research Centre is installed in the LE-7 engine.
The principal activities of NAL in the field of space technology are as follows:
● Research on basic technologies for spaceplanes, with the focus on aerodynamics, advanced composite structures, flight control, propulsion systems, manned space flight and orbiter manoeuvreing engines;
● Joint research with NASDA on the aerodynamics, guidance and control, and structure of the H-II Orbiting Plane (HOPE);
● Research on oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine components;
● Research on in-orbit base systems and utilization of the space environment.
4. National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA)
NASDA was established by law in October 1969 as the central body responsible for the development of space technology in Japan and the promotion of space activities solely for peaceful purposes.
NASDA's main tasks are to develop satellites and their launching vehicles; to launch and track the satellites and promote the utilization of space technology; and to develop methods and facilities required for these activities.
NASDA orbited various satellites by means of N-I, N-II and H-I launch vehicles.
To meet the demand for launching large-scale satellites in the 1990s, NASDA developed the H-II launch vehicle with its indigenous technology, and its first flight was successfully made in February 1994.
NASDA is also striving to promote research and development of experimental technology in the space environment, and to implement the space station project with other countries.
NASDA has four centres to implement its activities.
(a) Tanegashima Space Center
The Tanegashima Space Center is NASDA's largest facility, located in the Tanegashima Island 115 kilometres south of Kyushu.
The Center has launch pads, test facilities and tracking systems.
(b) Tsukuba Space Center
The Center conducts the Agency's research and development program, equipped with up-to-date test facilities.
It also plays a central role for tracking and control of satellites in Japan.
(c) Kakuda Propulsion Center
This Center is responsible for research and development of constituent parts of propulsion system.
(d) Earth Observation Center
The Earth Observation Center receives and processes remote sensing data sent by earth observation satellites.
5. Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
Directly under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture is the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), a central institute for space and astronautical science in Japan.
ISAS conducts scientific research using space vehicles.
For this purpose, it develops and operates sounding rockets, satellite launchers, scientific satellites, planetary probes and scientific balloons.
As of August 1996, 21 scientific and test spacecraft had been launched, including Suisei and Sakigake, which explored Halley's comet in 1986.
ISAS was founded in April 1981 as a result of the reorganization of the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science University of Tokyo, which was the core of space research in Japan from 1964 to 1981.
It launched the first Japanese satellite Ohsumi in 1970.
As one of the inter-university research institutes run with the cooperation of researchers in universities, ISAS takes part in graduate education.
Some of its students are from the University of Tokyo, where a number of ISAS faculty members have positions as professors or associate professors.
Other students from various universities receive part of their education at ISAS by working under the guidance of ISAS staff.
The main campus of ISAS is at Sagamihara, about 20 kilometres west of metropolitan Tokyo.
Several ISAS centres are set up around the country.
(a) Kagoshima Space Centre
The Kagoshima Space Centre (KSC) is located in a mostly hilly area of Uchinoura-machi, on the east coast of Ohsumi Peninsula, Kagoshima Prefecture.
Covering a total of 72 hectares, the area of KSC includes various facilities for launching rockets, telemetry and tracking, command stations for rockets and satellites and optical observation posts, at sites developed by flattening the tops of several hills.
Building in KSC have a total floor space of 17,038 square metres.
(b) Noshiro Testing Centre
The Noshiro Testing Centre (NTC) was established in 1962 at Asanai Beach, Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture.
The ground firing test stand, workshop, measurement centre, optical observatory and other facilities are provided for ground-based test firing of large-scale solid motors.
Basic research on liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen engines was started in 1975, and several research facilities have been constructed.
ISAS, which began studies on the development of the air turboramjet engine in 1976, tested the engine at NTC from 1990 to 1996 under sea-level static conditions using a quarter-scale model.
With a total floor space of 3,835 square meters as of August 1996, NTC stands facing the Sea of Japan, far from towns and highways to ensure the safety of its firing range.
(c) Usuda Deep Space Centre
Surrounded by mountains that block out city noise, the Usuda Deep Space Centre is located 1,456 metres above sea level at Usuda-machi, Nagano Prefecture.
It started operating in October 1984. A large parabolic antenna 64 metres in diameter, a receiver, a transmitter and a ranging system in S-band are provided at the Centre to serve as a deep space tracking, telemetry and command station.
The facilities can be controlled by the Deep Space Operation Centre at the ISAS main campus at Sagamihara, Kanagawa.
(d) Sanriku Balloon Centre
The Sanriku Balloon Centre is located at Sanriku-machi, on the east coast of Iwate Prefecture, facing the Pacific Ocean.
The balloon launch site is on a hill 230 metres above sea level.
The control centre stands beside the launch site, where launch control and assembly of the balloon and its payload are conducted.
On a hill about 700 metres south-west of the launch site is the telemetry Centre, where balloon tracking, telemetry receiving and telecommanding are conducted.
In May 1987, a new telemetry centre was constructed at the top of Mount Ohkubo, 4-1 kilometres west of the launch site.
(e) Collaboration of ISAS and NASA in space experiments with particle accelerators and Geotail
ISAS conducted space experiments with particle accelerator (SEPAC) jointly with NASA in 1983 and 1992.
In SEPAC, accelerated ion and electron beams were ejected from the space shuttle.
In 1992, the Geotail satellite developed by ISAS was launched by NASA using a Delta II launch vehicle.
The Geotail satellite carries scientific instruments developed by both ISAS and NASA.
6. Ministry of Transport
The space-related organizations under the Ministry of Transport are the Transport Policy Bureau and Civil Aviation Bureau acting as a headquarters, the Electronic Navigation Research Institute as a subsidiary organization, and the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency and the Japan Meteorological Agency as affiliated agencies.
Those bodies have been using meteorological, geodetic and aeronautical satellites, and accumulating knowledge about their use.
In addition, space technology, such as large-scale geostationary satellite technology, has been steadily progressing.
It is now believed that it would be much more economical and effective to launch a large, multi-purpose satellite instead of launching several kinds of satellites separately in order to conduct meteorological observations and air traffic control.
As a result, the Ministry of Transport contracted to manufacture a Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) which will be launched in 1999 for its purpose.
The Ministry also supervises NASDA, a quasi-governmental agency, thus exercising control over satellite development.
Important projects under way include the following:
(a) Electric Navigation Research Institute (ENRI)
ENRI is now conducting research and development activities of satellite-based technologies for air navigation and air traffic control.
Major research and development projects relating to these areas which are now proceeding are as follows:
● Automatic Dependence Surveillance (ADS) - a surveillance system which gives pseudo-radar images to air traffic controllers by using aircraft-derived position data transmitted through satellite data link.
● Global Positioning System (GPS) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) - a system which improves integrity, accuracy and availability of GPS for civil aviation in Japan.
● GPS-based altimetry - an altitude measuring method which gives high accuracy and absolute altitude for aircraft by using GPS.
● Satellite data link - a system which improves air traffic control communication quality and surveillance capability for safety of transoceanic flights.
(b) Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (JMSA)
To establish Japanese territorial water, the positions of the mainland and the off-lying islands must be registered with the World Geodetic System (WGS).
The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency has therefore been participating in a joint international observation plan using the United States laser geodynamics satellite (LAGEOS) since 1982 to fix the precise positions of the mainland based on WGS.
The Agency has been conducting a maritime geodetic survey to determine, to a high degree of accuracy, the positions of the mainland and its off-lying islands and the distances between them, using the geodetic satellite of Japan, AJISAI, launched in August 1986.
(c) Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)
The Japan Meteorological Agency conducts space-based meteorological observations using GMS and meteorological rockets as part of the World Weather Watch programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
GMS observes cloud images and temperatures of sea surface and cloud top, and collects meteorological data from aircraft, buoys and meteorological observation stations in remote areas.
It also distributes by facsimile the cloud images obtained.
As the ground facility to operate GMS, the Agency has the Meteorological Satellite Centre, which comprises the Data Processing Centre for image data processing and the Command and Data Acquisition Station for communication between the Data Processing Centre and GMS.
The Satellite data are useful to weather forecasting on an operational basis, and are used in the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) of WMO.
In addition, the Data Processing Centre receives and analyses data from the polar-orbiting meteorological satellites of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The Meteorological rockets observe temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind etc, at altitudes of between 30 and 60 kilometres.
Launching of the meteorological rockets are carried out by the Meteorological Rocket Observation Station, the sole facility capable of meteorological rocket observation in East Asia and the western Pacific.
The meteorological Research Institute develops techniques for the more effective use of meteorological satellite data, and conducts studies on sensors for the next generation of earth observing.
7. Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications plans and promotes policies governing the use of radio waves and space-related research and development in the same field.

(b) Telecommunications Advancement Organization of Japan
The Telecommunications Satellite Corporation of Japan was renewed as TAO in 1992.
The Corporation was established in 1979 to develop radio communications and seek effective utilization of radio waves in space by controlling the location, attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites and efficiently using the telecommunications facilities installed on those satellites.
The main tasks of TAO are as follows:
● Controlling the location, attitude etc. of communications and broadcasting satellites;
● Having radio systems installed in communications and broadcasting satellites utilized by those who open radio stations using the systems.
The Kimitsu Satellite Control Centre tracks and control satellites.
N-STAR a/b and BS-3a/3b/3n currently tracked and controlled using eight antennas (in the 6 to 18 diameter class).
To promote the spread of high-vision satellite broadcasting (high-definition television), TAO owns one of the transponders aboard BS-3b, and leases it to NHK and commercial broadcasting companies.
8. Other organizations
In addition to the above-mentioned organizations, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the National Police Agency, the Geographical Survey Institute of the Ministry of Construction and the Fire Defense Agency of the Ministry of Home Affairs have made space-related budgetary appropriations.

A. Introduction
Space activities were introduced in Lebanon in the 1960's with the installation of an earth station for telephone communications through satellite.
As noted in our previous report to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the economic sectors with outer space related activities in Lebanon are Telecommunications, TV Broadcasting, and Meteorology.
In each of these sectors an evolution in infrastructure was evident during the course of the year, especially in the sector of satellite-based telecommunications.
In addition, there was an expansion of the use of satellite for Internet where satellites are used in order to communicate with the outside world.
Since its establishment, the Center has been playing an active role in planning programs needed for remote sensing technology.
The present report of space activities in Lebanon prepared by the National Center for Scientific Research (NCSR) is divided in two parts:
● Space communications, broadcasting and meteorology
● National Center for Remote Sensing
B. Space-Related Activities in Lebanese Economic Sectors
1. Space Telecommunications
Presently the Ministry of Power and Telecommunication has five earth stations for satellite communications based in two localities, Arbaniye & Jouret El Ballout.
The Ministry is undertaking a project to make the transition from analogue to digital transmission.
These earth stations are used for telephone communications and TV broadcasting.
(a) Arbaniye
In this locality, two earth stations are connected to INTELSAT using digital transmission.
Each station has a communications capabilities of 10 channels (of 1 and 2 Mb/s).
(b) Jouret El Ballout
There are 3 earth stations in this locality, of which one is used for direct TV broadcasting.
The other two earth stations are connected with INTELSAT and are used for telephone communications.
One is analog and the other is digital.
A project will be conducted in the near future to make the transition from analog to digital.
The digital earth station can be linked to the satellite via 8 channels (l Mb/s & 2 Mb/s).
The earth station used for broadcasting TV is connected to ARABSAT satellite using analog transmission.
2. TV Broadcasting
As mentioned previously, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications has an earth station dedicated to TV broadcasting.
Lebanon has two TV stations which broadcast their programmes to other countries through ARABSAT and PANAMSAT.
Soon the Lebanese Government will introduce new legislation to control TV stations broadcasting outside Lebanon.
3. Meteorological Information
The Directorate of Climatology of Lebanon has an earth station to gather analog images (Wefax format) from the climate based satellites (geostationary satellites).
In 1997, this Administration will acquire a new earth station that has the capability to record very accurate digital imagery.
The Directorate of Climatology actively cooperates with the NCSR Lebanon in assisting the research sector in obtaining climate data as required.
4. Internet
This year, 6 private enterprises are connecting people in Lebanon to the Internet using their own each stations to establish the communication link with the satellites.
Currently, there are about 5000 subscribers in Lebanon, with the largest number in Beirut.
The Lebanese NCSR is a main founding member of LARN (Lebanese Academic and Research Network) whose mission is to set up and manage a national computer network linking all institutions of higher learning, academic research and non-commercial scientific research.
The NCSR is about to provide full Internet access to all its members individually with the purchase of a SUN NETRA server.
It is planned to link all the Universities and Institutions to it.
This undertaking also entails acquiring a high speed, large bandwidth link with the outside world and with large local customers.
Negotiations are already underway to establish the link and several solutions are being considered.
C. National Center for Remote Sensing
1. Justification
Establishing the National Center for Remote Sensing in Lebanon is a reflection of the country's efforts to catch up with the huge scientific advances, notably those related to data gathering and information.
This is in line with the aspirations of the National Council for Scientific Research.
The Lebanese terrain, complex as it is, requires by necessity the application of such techniques as remote sensing and related fields such as geographic information systems (GS).
2. Aims
The Center's main goal is to apply the new techniques to development projects that are planned or implemented in Lebanon.
This starts at the planning stage and goes all the way to implementation.
Help is extended to public and private sector organizations to plan and implement the use of remote sensing in their operations, with a notable emphasis on environmental concerns.
The Center's main task is to secure the needed databases on timely, accurate and wide national coverage, for different developmental sectors, both on land and marine aspects.
Interaction with the remote sensing community on the national, regional and international scene is essential.
This ensures the quality standards that must always be observed by the Center.
It will also assure that training and capacity building is an ongoing process.
As such, the expertise at the Center will put at the disposal of decision makers the proper advice on actions and policies of relevance to remote sensing and space.
3. Functions
Three main functions are carried out:
● Making use of the wealth of data supplied from remote sensing platforms, with needed conversion, rectification and processing;
● Producing the needed documents on an accurate basis, both geographically and scientifically, to comply with proper decision making for development;
● Ground truthing and material verification, for accuracy and quality.
4. Organization
The Center is part of the Engineering and technical Division of the National Council for Scientific Research.
The Center's structure/staff consists of two main specialities: sectoral specialists, i.e. in geology and natural resources, agriculture, water environment, etc. and systems specialists covering computer science, image processing and GIS.
5. Strategy and Policy
The Center's strategy reflects that of the NCSR, which boils down to promoting the development of Lebanon through the application of science and technology.
The policies that such strategy require are exemplified in the creation of research centres, enhancing scientific contribution into development projects and capacity building.
6. Projects
Although still at its formulation stages, the Center has leaped forward onto the road to scientific productivity and economic return by starting to be involved in some projects and at the same time planning for others.
More than one Ministry and regional and international agencies are cooperating with each other.
The topics cover water sources, agriculture, iron ore, environmental concerns and archaeological sites.
The Center is looking for more and wider relationships. C. Conclusion
This report indicates that Lebanon is developing sectors related to satellite activity quite rapidly.
The development of space technology and its applications has resulted in significant contributions to key sectors of the Lebanese national economy.
PAPUA NEW GUINEA The Government of Papua New Guinea reports that it does not have any outer space related programmes or activities.
SWEDEN A. National organization of space activities
1. The Swedish National Space Board (SNSB)
The Swedish National Space Board, established in 1972 under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, is the central governmental agency responsible for the Swedish national and international space and remote sensing programmes.
For the research programme the Board receives funds from the Ministry of Education and Science.
The responsibilities of the Board include:

B. Space applications programmes
1. Remote sensing of earth resources and environment
Development and consolidation of remote sensing activities in Sweden is continuing.
New advanced equipment has been made available through own development, through purchase, or through international co-operation.
Several major co-operative field experiments have been carried out.
The objective is to assess the potential of the technology for various applications, but above all to acquaint the potential users with the available technology at an early stage.
The Esrange facility, which has been receiving and processing Landsat data on behalf of ESA since 1978, receives SPOT data on behalf of Spotimage, France.
Data is also regularly received from the polar orbiting satellites JERS-1 and EXOS-D (Japan), and from Resurs (RF).
There is an agreement with ESA to receive and process ERS-1 and ERS-2 data.
A separate ESA facility has been established for that purpose at Salmijärvi (near Esrange).
SSC Satellitbild in Kiruna is processing and distributing SPOT data in co-operation with the French company SPOT Image.
SSC Satellitbild specializes in providing geometrically precision corrected and analyzed SPOT and Landsat data for the world market.
Sweden co-operates with France in the SPOT remote sensing satellite programme and the Kiruna facility is one of the two principal stations in the SPOT network.
Sweden participates in the ESA programme for receiving, preprocessing, archiving and distribution of images from remote sensing satellites (Earthnet).
The Swedish ground station at Esrange, Kiruna, forms part of the system and is collecting Landsat data on a routine basis.
Sweden also participates in the remote sensing programmes of ESA such as the programme for development of remote sensing satellites (Envisat-l/Polar Platform) and the earth observation preparatory programme (EOPP).
The Swedish Space Corporation, in co-operation with the Swedish National Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities, is in the process of establishing the Environmental Satellites Data Centre (MDC) in Kiruna.
The primary tasks of the Centre will be production and management of environmental data bases.
It will also develop new data bases and carry out surveillance activities in the environmental field.
2. Meteorology
Cloud cover photographs and other meteorological data from ESA, United States and Russian weather satellites are received regularly by the High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) stations of the Swedish Weather Services and are used in weather forecasting.
A project concerning the establishment of short term weather forecasting and regional weather service based on advanced space and remote sensing techniques, including weather radar, SODAR, microwave radiometry and weather satellites, has entered into an operational phase.
Development of the operational use of advanced digital image analysis of polar weather satellite data is going on.
A microwave radiometer for sounding of temperature and humidity of the atmosphere has been developed for operational use.
Sweden participates in the meteorology programmes of ESA and Eumetsat, such as the programmes for development of the geostationary satellites Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and the polar satellites Metop.
Sweden participates in the telecommunications programmes of ESA such as the programmes for Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES), the technology demonstration mission (Artemis) and data relay satellites (DRS).
On a national level, the Swedish Space Corporation operates the Tele-X/Sirius telecommunications satellite system, which provides the following services:
(a) High-speed digital data and video communications, 64 kbit/s - 2 Mbit/s, using small earth stations.
(b) Direct TV-broadcasting to small (50 cm antenna diameter) home receivers.

Sweden (SSC) is active in the development of GPS (Global Positioning System) technology for aeronautical, maritime and landmobile applications, using the Swedish GP&C (Global Positioning and Communication) invention.
This invention makes possible the location of several thousand mobiles on a single radio channel.
Sweden participates in the ESA programme element (ARTES 9), which is part of a cooperation project between ESA, Eurocontrol and the European Commission aiming at a European contribution to a Global Navigation Satellite System.
5. Space transportation
Sweden participates in the ESA programmes for development of the Ariane launchers, i.e. the present Ariane 5, as well as in the programmes aimed at improving the launcher.
C. National scientific space programmes
1. Satellites
(a) Viking
Swedeńs first satellite was launched from Kourou in February 1986.
The mission ended in May 1987.
The scientific objective of the Viking satellite was to study the ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at high geomagnetic latitudes in the attitude region up to about two Earth radii.
Simultaneous measurements were made of electric and magnetic fields, particle distributions, plasma composition and waves as well as imaging in the ultraviolet of the aurora beneath.
(b) Freja
Swedeńs second one, is also a scientific satellite designed to carry instruments for research into the aurora and other magnetospheric/ionospheric phenomena.
The low cost designed satellite was launched on October 6, 1992, on the Chinese carrier Long March 2 and is still in operation.
The project has been carried out in cooperation with Germany.
The satellite weighs 214 kg in the final orbit, which ranges in altitude between 600 and 1 756 km.
The inclination of the orbit is 63 degrees.
The scientific mission of Freja has many similarities with that of Viking.
The auroral zone is the "mission target" and the satellite carries energetic particle detectors, magnetic and electric wave experiments, electric field sensors and a UV imager.
The Freja design provides substantially higher data rate than that used on Viking.
Freja is operated from Esrange.
Data is received at Esrange and at Prince Albert Satellite Station in Canada.
(c) Astrid 1
Astrid 1 is a Swedish microsatellite, launched in January 1995 from Plesetsk in the Russian Federation into a polar orbit.
Astrid́s main scientific mission was to investigate near-space plasma, particularly neutral particle phenomena.
High resolution measurements in the upper ionosphere and the lower magnetosphere have contributed to increasing the knowledge of basic processes of fundamental importance to the physics of neutral particles.
The payload was designed by the Swedish Institute for Space Physics in Kiruna.
The scientific payload ceased to function in March 1995, but the technical experiments part held on till September.
The satellite ceased to function on September 27, 1995.
Successors to Astrid (2 and 3) are being planned.
Swedeńs next scientific satellite Odin, with a combined astronomy and aeronomy mission, is under development.
Odin is a scientific satellite for spectroscopic studies at submillimetre wavelength of astronomical objects and processes in the Earth́s atmosphere.
The project is carried out in cooperation with Canada, France and Finland.
The launch, on a Russian launcher, is planned for early 1998 with an operational lifetime of two years.
(d) IBIZA/IMPACT
The Investigation of Magnetospheric Particle Acceleration and Turbulence is a project under study in co-operation with Germanýs Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy.
The project comprises two satellites (300 kg each) with the mission to perform coordinated measurements in the Earth́s magnetosphere from highly elliptic orbits.
Current plans envision launching in the early period of the next decade.
(e) Hannes
Hannes is another Swedish satellite project under study.
The planned mission is to study a number of asteroids in order to increase the understanding of the evolution of the planetary system (cosmogony) and the local effects of the solar wind in interplanetary space on the nature of the plasma processes.
The project is being planned for international cooperation.
(f) Other Satellite Projects
The Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna and the Swedish Space Corporation have built experiments for measurements of mass and energy distribution for ions and electrons in the magnetosphere.
One experiment has been launched within the Interball-project.
The Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna will participate with hot plasma experiments (ASPERA) in the planned project Mars-96.
The Institute of Space Physics in Kiruna has participated in the development of a particle experiment for the ESA-satellite Ulysses.
Both the Kiruna and the Uppsala departments of the Institute of Space Physics and the department of Plasma Physics of the Alfvén Laboratory, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, are involved in the Cluster project in the Solar Terrestrial Science Programme, the first cornerstone in ESA space science programme Horizon 2000.
The Stockholm Observatory and the Astronomical Institutes in Lund and Uppsala participate with several quest investigator programmes on the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite launched in January 1978 and still operating.
The Stockholm Observatory also takes active part in the ESA satellite project Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in the construction of an IR-camera (ISOCAM).
2. Sounding Rockets and Balloons
Swedish sounding rocket and balloon launches have been carried out since 1962 and since 1968 from Esrange.
Most of these have been and are international cooperative projects.
The Swedish sounding rocket and balloon programme is concentrated on four main areas:
● magnetosphere and ionosphere physics
● upper atmosphere physics and chemistry
● astrophysical infrared and sub-millimetre studies
● material, fluid and bio-science in microgravity
The Swedish Space Corporation is responsible for the technical execution of the projects as well as for the operation of Esrange.
The Swedish MASER programme (Materials Science Experiment Rockets) which started in 1987, offers one launch per year for experiments within material physics, fluid- and bio-science.
There is an increasing interest in microgravity experiments of long duration.
A programme, named MAXUS, is carried out jointly with Germany and it is based on a required payload weight of 750 kg and 14 - 15 minutes of microgravity.
The first successful MAXUS launch took place at Esrange in 1992, the second one in 1995 and the third in 1996.
The main MAXUS users are the European Space Agency ESA and the German space agency DARA.
3. Ground based experiments
Sweden is participating in the work of the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association - EISCAT.
The association has installed a multistatic incoherent scatter facility in the auroral zone, comprising a system of stations at Tromso and Svalbard (Norway), Kiruna (Sweden) and Sodankylä (Finland).
